</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to see you looking so well this morning, Mr. Martin, and bracing yourself for another enthusiastic and interesting week in Committee. This morning we start to discuss the staffing of this so-called reform of local government. Clause 8 deals with the transfer of staff to the new authorities and the first group of amendments is essentially about the unacceptable powers that the Secretary of State wishes to take upon himself to influence and manipulate that transfer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to spell out that the boundaries discussions in Committee have resulted in a near farce. Scotland will be littered with small councils that cannot possibly provide efficient and effective services. In many areas of Scotland the boundary problems are unresolved. We now want to discuss the transfer of staff but the transfer to what? We do not have a boundaries map which would allow any sensible disucssion of where staff should be transferred from and where they should be transferred to. At present we have a boundaries farce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already discussed costs. It is clear to everyone but the Government that whether reorganisation costs £200 million or £720 million in terms of the burden it will place on council tax payers and business tax payers or, indeed, in terms of the cuts in services that will be needed to meet that cost, this is a Bill too far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today we are discussing a new crisis, one of timetabling. One year from today political parties in Scotland will be expected to start campaigning for the new so-called unitary authorities. Elections will be held on 5 April 1995. This debate is absolutely crucial because it is about
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>482</span>
transferring 300,000 people from one system to another. It is about a payroll bill of nearly £3.7 billion. That transfer will take place in the few months between the establishment of a staff commission, when and if the Bill receives Royal Assent, and the end of the year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We intend to use the amendments to illustrate that, once again, local government is likely to be pitched into a crisis not of its own making but one deliberately engendered by a Government hell-bent on making changes which the staff in local government have not signed up for. A crisis of morale already exists among those staff. They care about the services they provide. They are dedicated and often have rich skills and display professionalism. When morale is affected it can undermine service delivery. Apart from providing services, which is their bread and butter, staff are concerned about their future. Those 300,000 people cannot be dismissed lightly. Their families, aspirations, incomes, careers, conditions of service and pay levels are crucial to them. Their morale should not be undermined to such an extent that the services that we hold in high regard start to suffer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 8 and this group of amendments relate to the transfer of employees. We seek a sensible balance between the transfer of the staff to the new authorities and the ability of those new authorities to take decisions and to develop policies that are not unduly constrained by what the House may decide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another issue for consideration is the Secretary of State's powers. If there is one main feature of 15 years of Tory Government in Scotland, it is their desire to centralise: to centralise power in the Scottish Office and to take more powers from this House, not through primary legislation, from which they shy away, but by parliamentary orders. That is simply unacceptable to the Opposition. We believe that the main concerns, parameters and frameworks to deal with staffing should be dealt with in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, first, local authorities' principal function is to look after the people who live in their new authority areas? Secondly, it is important that the Secretary of State does not allow circumstances to arise in which, regardless of the provision of services, jobs for the boys are created. During the transition period, it is important that my right hon. Friend keeps control over what could be, without such powers, an open-ended financial commitment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's remark about "jobs for the boys" was unfortunate, because it is symptomatic of the enmity that lurks within the Conservative party towards everything connected with local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning we are talking of dedicated officials: from chief executives to home helps and people working in the cleaning and catering services. We cannot embark on that debate with the suggestion that all those people are on the make and are seeking extra salaries and perks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not give way just now. I know that jobs for the boys is not a prevalent issue in local

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>483</span>
government. If the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) wants to intervene again, I should be grateful if he would clarify what he was saying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I meant by "jobs for the boys" was based on my experience of the previous local government reorganisations. As I have said before, Fife was a perfect example of where people doing the same jobs were given reclassified or recategorised titles only but subsequently received massive salary increases. That is a statement of fact; it can be checked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those so-called statements of fact will be utterly refuted when we reach clause 11 which deals with such matters. Those facts were simply mischievous remarks built on scurrilous comments about the quality of local government staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Secretaries of State for Scotland have always wanted to take more and more powers to themselves. A basic question of trust arises. The Opposition, most trade unions, the Scottish Trades Union Congress and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities have much difficulty in trusting a Government who have sought to wreak so much damage on local councils in the past 15 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Through the amendments, we want to ensure that a balance is struck between the necessary powers that the Secretary of State would want to influence the shape of the transfer and the necessity for local authority associations, the trade unions and others to have confidence in the process. We do not believe that the measures in the Bill provide such confidence. We want the powers of the Secretary of State to be curtailed dramatically and a balance to be struck.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also want the major principles of the transfer to be included in the Bill. In a sense, that is linked to the Secretary of State's desire to take more powers to himself. If there is to be certainty in a confused and confusing process, staff need to know what the primary legislation involves. It should not be left to the whim of the Secretary of State to make orders as he sees fit. Such certainty is crucial in an environment where morale is low, trust in the Government is exceedingly limited and people are fearful of their future in the new authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those fears are justified when one considers the rantings and ravings of councils such as Kyle and Carrick, which has stated what it wants to do with key personnel and key services, such as social work and education. The concept of a minimalist authority is a smoke-screen for the privatisation of essential services. That concept underpins the fears of many employees in Scottish local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has contradicted himself. He has made a strong plea for local government to go it alone and to do things its way, but he then criticises a council that is looking forward, considering the future provision of services and looking at positive means of dealing with the problems that it could face once the Bill is enshrined in law. Why does the hon. Gentleman not recognise that local authorities have their job to do and leave them to get on with it? That is what he has asked the Secretary of State to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are legislating to ensure that we have consistency, standards and level playing fields. We want
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>484</span>
Scotland to receive the same standard of service, if not better, than that it has had in the past. Kyle and Carrick is a right-wing lunatic authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Shame.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us not mince our words. We are dealing with staffing and the future of 300,000 people. The Bill is complex and confusing, which is bad enough. When one picks up a newspaper and reads the rantings of that right-wing council, however, the effect is devastating for those who work in local government. Many employees in Strathclyde give valuable service to our constituents. They now live in fear that they may end up being transferred to an authority that wants to act as a post box before staff are shunted into the maketplace and that is followed by contracting out, privatisation and the consequent withdrawal of services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Government would not like to be employees in local government when faced with those prospects. On top of that we hear the right-wing outpourings of Kyle and Carrick.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only lunatic aspect of the argument is the hon. Gentleman's rantings. If he had been in Kyle and Carrick last night, he would have heard the council announce that it had frozen its council tax and, at the time, issue a commitment to spend up to £6 million in expanding the infrastructure and on the expansion of involvements in Kyle and Carrick. It is not a lunatic authority, but a positive one that is looking to the future. It will provide jobs for its people and it will look after their interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I respect that you are a tolerant man, Mr. Martin, but I shall not continue the debate about Kyle and Carrick except to ask what is reasonable about an authority that has had private discussions with Spanish contractors? The convenor has publicly stated that the council has had private discussions with Spanish contractors about a contract that has nearly two years to run and which has been freely negotiated with an in-house team. It is possible that that team will not be able to bid for a new contract. At the end of the day, therefore, that so-called sane and sensible council might sell the rights of its own employees to foreign operators after holding private discussions. If that is sane and sensible and if that is what the Bill means for the fabric of local government, Labour Members are quite right to oppose every single aspect of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I back everything that my hon. Friend has said. I shall explain what is meant by "expansion of involvements". The provost of Kyle and Carrick has had five separate meetings—the chief executive was also present at least one or two of them—with a private contractor. Surely that must be a breach of the rules and regulations. I am not happy about the fact that an open tender is about to be offered because there is still at least a year and a half left to run on the existing tender. The council must be in breach of the regulations because of that open tender.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tabled a question to the Secretary of State asking how many private meetings had taken place between Ministers and the leadership, the Tories, of Kyle and Carrick.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0274">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>485</span>
Yesterday, I received the reply, "I shall reply to the hon. Member shortly." Those concerned do not even know how many meetings they have had—but there have been meetings, and I suspect that much of the initiative for opting out and flogging off in Kyle and Carrick comes from St. Andrew's house.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes the point more eloquently than I do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour Members are concerned about the welfare, future, aspirations and careers of employees who are providing a valuable service. That is in contrast to the utterances that emanate from Kyle and Carrick in particular, where there is an effort to place ideology way out at the front and the concerns of employees way behind. No Bill dealing with staff, including this Bill, can proceed on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since I was referred to by the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes), what is the precise allegation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We want to know from the Scottish Office and the Minister why, after a rampage through Scottish local government in which compulsory competitive tendering and the merits, wisdom and benefits to the taxpayer of contracting out were advocated a Tory-controlled council was permitted to have private meetings with Spanish contractors, to tear up existing agreements, freely negotiated with staff within the law, and to progress to a ban on in-house tendering for the contract? All that contravenes the CCT contract. A party that is equivocal about Europe is now attempting to use a European Community directive to get its own way. We want to know precisely why the Secretary of State and the Minister are not acting responsibly in the circumstances that I have described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have not acted irresponsibly in any way. I am trying to ascertain what lay behind the clear personal allegation by the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, that I have somehow acted improperly. What is the precise allegation about meetings that I am alleged to have had?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see, Mr. Martin, that the Clerk is advising you that we are straying slightly from the amendments, but I should like your tolerance for a little longer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the allegation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am willing to respond to the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not need the Clerk to tell me that we are straying. I know. No one in the Committee has suggested that the Minister or any other hon. Member is acting improperly. [HON. MEMBERS: "Yes, they did."] Order. I say that no one suggested that. If they had done they would have been out of order. Perhaps the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) will now discuss the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>486</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a quite refreshing discussion of staffing matters. We are discussing the transfer of staff from existing to new authorities. If the map remains the same for an authority that we have been discussing, it might constitute a new authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Kynoch 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has spoken at length about employees' rights. One respects the fact that employees have rights, but I have not yet heard the hon. Gentleman talk about the rights of the taxpayer. Has not the taxpayer the right to obtain the best possible service at the least possible cost?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. Scottish taxpayers and council tax payers, in comparison with those in England or Wales, have had an extraordinarily good deal from the employees who work for them. That issue should not divide the Committee. The costs of the Government's reorganisation, whether £200 million or £720 million, will not, however, constitute good value for the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are designed to seek the balance that we have talked about. They are intended to reassure employees that there is a level playing field. An attempt has been made to provide a balance of power between the Secretary of State and other key players in the process. The amendments provide for a degree of certainty in the most difficult local government process of the past 30 years, and would make sure that best practice from the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 is adopted. It defies us to discover why much of the 1973 Act has been abandoned in the Bill—we want the key influences that will shape the transfer of staff to be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not satisfied that any of those criteria have been met. I hope that when he responds to the first batch of amendments, the Minister can go some way to accepting our proposals and will allude to the fact that employees' rights are critical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in entire agreement with the hon. Member for Fife, Central that the debate is important and that staff are local authorities' biggest and most important resource. It is unfortunate that the debate—as with so many others in the Committee—has been marred by a clear personal smear by the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, following the allegations he made about my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I put it on the record that I have had one meeting with the Kyle and Carrick majority group and my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr about local government reform, as I have had one meeting with the hon. Member for Fife, Central and the Labour group about local government reform? I have had no other meetings with Kyle and Carrick district council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to put it on the record that the timorous intervention made by my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley resulted in the hon. Member for Ayr apologising to the Committee for doing something that was out of order. It is important the Minister admits it when an intervention by a member of the Committee has revealed certain behaviour on the part of another member of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Members of the Committee must stick to discussing the amendment. I have allowed the Minister to put the record straight about meetings with certain organisations, but we must get on with discussing the amendment. I make it clear: no one has said that anyone is acting improperly because that would not be allowed. No one has acted improperly. The Minister is not acting improperly. The hon. Member for Ayr is not acting improperly. That is on the record. It would be a great help if we could get on with discussing the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I recall that you suggested that the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley should withdraw certain remarks that he made in Committee a few sittings ago. He did not do that. When it was suggested that I had done something wrong, however, I confirmed, following checks, that I had been out of order and apologised to the individual concerned. I would suggest that, as a matter of honour, an issue is still to be settled. I await an apology. If one is not offered, and if you do not have further powers, Mr. Martin, is this a matter that I should refer to the Speaker?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All I can say to the hon. Member is that he is entitled to discuss any matter that he is anxious about with Madam Speaker. I am concerned with what goes on in Committee. We have the amendment before us. The hon. Member must remain within the confines of the amendment. Whether hon. Members want or do not want to withdraw remarks that have been made outside the Committee is not for me to intervene on. All that I can do is try to keep the Committee to a discussion of the amendment. That is not happening, so I ask the Minister to confine his remarks to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said, the transfer of staff is crucial. Behind the usual rhetoric from the hon. Member for Fife, Central, the Opposition and the Government are not too far apart on the technicalities of how the system will work. Staff are worried about what the next few years will hold. It was for that reason that I announced last March the Government's intention to establish a staff commission. Subsequently, we have listened to what local authorities have been telling us and made it clear that we intend, before the Bill is enacted to establish a staff advisory committee—effectively a precursor of the staff commission—to begin the groundwork for the commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am therefore, pleased to announce this morning the name of the chairman of that body. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has appointed Mr. Robert Peggie CBE to chair the staff advisory committee that he is establishing to assist the reorganisation of local government. My right hon. Friend has made clear his intention to appoint Mr. Peggie as the chairman of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>488</span>
staff commission, which he intends to establish as soon as the Bill is approved by Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome that appointment—I cannot speak on behalf of my hon. Friends. I know Bob Peggie as the former chief executive of Lothian region and know him to be a man of the highest integrity. He is also a Hearts supporter. Hearts beat Hibs 2–1 on Sunday—that was the 21st match in which Hibs have been unable to beat Hearts. Can the Minister confirm whether Bob Peggie will continue as a parliamentary commissioner when he takes up that appointment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his generous tribute to Bob Peggie. I can clarify the point about timing. Mr. Peggie intends to retire from his part-time post of ombudsman on 30 June and will take up his new appointment with effect from 1 April. As the hon. Gentleman said, he is widely respected as the local authority ombudsman in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will he be appointed this year or next year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He will be appointed this year as chairman of the staff advisory committee. He cannot take up his appointment as chairman of the staff commission until that body is established by the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What rules, regulations and guidelines will the advisory committee have? Do I understand the Minister correctly that it will be the precursor body and that the same people will then become members of the staff commission when that body is established?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the intention. It follows exactly what happened in Wales. The Secretary of State cannot establish a staff commission until he has the powers to do so. The advisory committee will therefore advise the Secretary of State on general staffing matters until the Bill receives Royal Assent. The specific powers are contained in clause 12.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the shadow chairman of the staff commission be consulted about the appointments to the commission, or will the Secretary of State appoint members on his own?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are considering carefully the nominations that we have received. We asked for nominations specifically from COSLA and STUC. As it is public knowledge that we are appointing members of a staff commission, other bodies have submitted nominations. I confirm that part of the purpose of announcing the appointment of Mr. Peggie as chairman is so that we can consult him before finalising the list of other members of the commission. We intend to announce the other members reasonably soon, certainly before 1 April when Mr. Peggie takes up his appointment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley said, as well as being local authority ombudsman, Mr. Peggie was chief executive of Lothian regional council. He held that post at a time of some controversy, and it is a tribute to him that he was universally respected during his period of office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will a set of ground rules and principles be given to Mr. Peggie? If so, will they be incorporated in the Bill and made public?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The job of the advisory committee will be to issue general advice. There is no secret about any of the matters. The powers of the commission are set out in the Bill, and we shall be discussing them in the not-too-distant future. There is no problem about any specific guidance that the Secretary of State may give the advisory committee being public knowledge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that we will discuss these issues in more details under clause 12. We welcome the announcement of the chair of the advisory committee, the appointment does not reflect, however, the Opposition's views about the way that the staffing commission and the advisory committee may be established. Although we support the appointment of the excellent person who will be the chair, huge question marks remain about the way that the two bodies will be established. I hope that the Minister will respect our concerns on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point entirely, and am grateful to him for welcoming the appointment. I understand that Opposition Members wish to discuss these matters in detail as we go through the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not quite a detail, but what salary has been agreed with Mr. Peggie?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We expect that Mr. Peggie will devote about one day a week to the post of chairman of the advisory committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One day a week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, as chairman of the advisory committee. As the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) will appreciate, the final salary has not yet been determined, but it is likely to be about £10,000 per annum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that salary based on a standard formula? On the basis of £10,000 for working one day a week, if Mr. Peggie works seven days a week—this is clearly an onerous job and is likely to become more so—will he be on £50,000, £60,000 or £70,000 a year by the time he becomes chairman of the staff commission?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the greatest of respect to Mr. Peggie and the importance of the job, we do not envisage him working full time for seven days a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have given the hon. Member for Linlithgow the information he asked for about the chairmanship of the advisory committee. It is an important post, but its importance is not necessarily measured simply by the hours put in but by the quality of the advice given to the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Had it not occurred to me to ask that question, would not the Committee have been left with the impression that Mr. Peggie was resigning from his post as ombudsman to do this job on a full-time basis? Or am I being unfair?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>490</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that we have ever suggested that the chairman of the advisory committee or staff commission would be a full-time executive position. It is an advisory committee, not an executive body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope to be able to reassure the hon. Member for Fife, Central about some of the detailed points that he has raised. Central Government have no secret blueprint of how the transfers should be achieved; neither is it intended that the Secretary of State should take control of the whole exercise. As the notes on clauses make clear, the drafting of clause 8 was designed to provide maximum flexibility in advance of discussions taking place with the staff commission and local authority interests on the best way to tackle the issues. Decisions on which staff should move to which council and how councils deal with staff identified as surplus to their requirements is, however, a matter for them, not central Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we envisage it, the Secretary of State's role would be primarily to provide, after due consultation, the general rules under which transfers should take place and to take account of advice offered by the staff commission. As I understand it, that is similar to the arrangements which were adopted in 1975. In keeping with this approach, the Government do not believe that they are in a position to tell each new council how many staff it will require. Situations will vary from one part of the country to another and it is only right that councils should be left to take their own decisions on staffing in the light of then-own structures and their own views on service provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I right in thinking that the 1973 Act set out the basic principles relating to the transfer of staff from existing authorities to the new ones and the compensation arrangements that would be in place for those made redundant? Those details are not included in the Bill. They should be so that everyone clearly knows what arrangements will be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair question. If the hon. Gentleman will bear with me I hope to answer it in the course of my remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I understand the argument of the hon. Member for Fife, Central correctly, the purpose of amendment No. 89 is to ensure that the Secretary of State exercises his power to make staff transfer orders. If I am correct in that understanding, may I give the Committee an absolute assurance that the Secretary of State does indeed intend to exercise this power. As to the question of the precise form and content of such orders, which comes to the question raised by the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh), I shall deal with that in a moment in the context of amendments Nos. 92, 93 and 94, but there should be no doubt that transfer orders will be made under this power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The use of the term "may" rather than "shall" is always good for an esoteric Committee discussion. On this occasion, may I advise the Committee that the term "may" has been preferred to "shall" on the grounds that "shall" might carry the implication that such orders were obliged to make provision for the transfer of all staff. As will become clear during our debate on amendment No. 90, that is not the Government's intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I understand correctly what the hon. Member for Fife, Central said, the common intention across the Committee appears to be that transfer orders would set
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0277">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>491</span>
out general rules, leaving it to transfer schemes prepared by the authorities to apply the rules to particular staff. That is the intention of the amendment and is certainly the intention of the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As drafted, clause 8 gives the Secretary of State the flexibility to make transfer orders which could provide, among other things, for general rules to govern the transfer of employees, for specific arrangements for individuals or groups of individuals and for local authorities to produce detailed transfer schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the aim of the amendment is to reduce that flexibility by requiring the Secretary of State to make general rules and, at the same time, requiring local authorities to make detailed transfer schemes. If that is the intention, it is something of a surprise. The intention of the drafting in clause 8 is to provide as much flexibility as possible to allow whatever arrangements are subsequently suggested by the staff commission and local authority interests to be incorporated. That is the purpose of the flexibility inherent in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government consider the detail of staff transfers to be largely a matter for local government. If, therefore, we are being told that local government wants the arrangements to include general rules to be provided by the Secretary of State and detailed schemes to be compiled by local authorities, I have no objection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened carefully to what the hon. Member for Fife, Central said and am prepared to reconsider matter of the format of the details and come back on Report with appropriate amendments. I am not sure that the amendment necessarily achieves precisely what he intends. I do not believe that there is a great difference of intention between the Government and the Opposition about the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the details of staff transfer composition will be dealt with by the local authorities, but will not they also have to deal with the principles behind the arrangements because they are not in the Bill as they were in the 1973 Act? If they have to examine the principles that will take time but even more time will be taken up if they also have to examine the details. How can that be done according to the short timetable offered to them by the Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are aiming to set the principles out clearly. The argument is about how flexible the Bill should be, but hon. Members are arguing for less flexibility. The difficulty with that approach is that it limits the flexibility which could result from consultations with local authorities and the staff commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The detailed schemes must be brought forward by the local authorities. That is not a matter of dispute between members of the Committee. I understand the point made by the hon. Member for Fife, Central about amendments Nos 92, 93 and 94.I am not necessarily convinced that the amendments meet his objective, but am not criticising him for it; we know the limitations on the resources of Opposition Members. In the belief that there is no substantial difference of view between the Government and the Opposition on the particular point at issue, however, I am happy to reconsider it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will understand that employees are anxious about their pensions and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>492</span>
superannuation arrangements. I have looked through various clauses to discover how that is dealt with. It may be my lack of understanding of the clauses, but I cannot find such provision, unless it is included in a term such as "general rule or rules". The Bill makes no reference to how employees' rights in relation to pensions and superannuation will be preserved. Can the Minister help me on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I can. The relevant legislation is the Superannuation Act 1972. Amendments which have been tabled by the Opposition will enable us to discuss the issue. I hope to give absolute assurances on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second part of amendment No. 94 requires existing authorities to seek the agreement of the staff commission in the event of a failure to agree detailed staff transfer schemes with the relevant shadow authorities. I agree with the hon. Member for Fife, Central that it is clearly necessary to provide for an arbiter in a situation where two or more authorities are required to agree on something, but the Government very much hope that a formal approach to such a referee will not, in practice, be necessary. Transfers are rightly a matter for the people who know the detail of the situation. Should problems arise, we would envisage the staff commission having an important role as conciliator. Only in the most extreme circumstances would we envisage the Secretary of State having to play a direct role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the Committee, therefore, that clause 8 is not intended to give the Secretary of State the power to intervene at will in the content of transfer schemes. Nevertheless, such a power is required as a last resort. Equally, it would be inappropriate for it to be exercised directly by the staff commission which is, as I have already emphasised, an advisory rather than an executive body. It will have a role as a conciliator if such disagreements arise. Of course, we hope that they will not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the intention in the second part of the amendment. Therefore, if it assists the Committee, I am happy to give the assurance that the Secretary of State will invite the staff commission to advise him on any scheme that requires his consent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What timetable does the Minister envisage for receiving and acting upon the advice? When will the Secretary of State expect a report and when will the provisions be implemented? We are on an exceedingly short time scale.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are talking about the period after the shadow authorities have been established. We are debating the time scale, but we all hope that the problems will not arise. The provision is for a reserve power when there is disagreement between authorities. I hope that there will be no such disagreements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the Committee that the Secretary of State will not use his powers at will. He will invite the staff commission to advise him on any scheme that requires his consent under the final reserve power envisaged in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What evidence of fact does the Minister have for his hope that such disagreements will not arise? Some of us think that they are bound to arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0278">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>493</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman thinks that such disagreements are bound to arise, he will support the power in the Bill. The evidence for my hope that they will not arise is my belief that the overwhelming majority of people in local government—we are talking about schemes that would be drawn up by officials—want local government to work properly and that there will be considerable good will once Parliament has passed the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reserve power is necessary. I hope that, at least to some extent, I have reassured the hon. Member for Fife, Central in relation to the amendment. He may wish to withdraw it, but if he presses it to a Division, I shall ask my hon. Friends not to accept the amendment. I hope that my assurances in this important debate are helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are important amendments, which relate to the next amendments for discussion, Nos. 90 and 91.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once again, the Minister's response is disappointing in several respects. As I understand the thrust of his argument, he wants to retain maximum flexibility. As I recall, he said that he had no secret blueprint. The problem is that he has no blueprint at all, secret or not. That is a matter of serious concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had hoped that the Minister would give the Committee and people beyond it a flavour of how the Government envisage the mechanics of this important transfer of staff. There are certainly circumstances within the contemplation of members of the Committee that would give rise to serious problems and great uncertainties. If the Minister retains a system that is infinitely flexible and is based on the reserve powers available to the Secretary of State for Scotland, by definition that will require it to be uncertain for a long time. It will produce much anxiety among members of staff whose interests we are trying to protect and, at this stage, to clarify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some members of the Committee have had more direct experience of local government than I have. I should like to know, through illustrative examples, how the Government foresee the provisions being implemented. Let us consider the transfer of the existing local authority of Strathclyde to the new authority based in Eastwood district. That will surely create difficulties in allocating staff—educational special advisers, and so on. We shall face difficult and intractable situations. The Minister has said that that is not a matter for central Government and that a local authority and its professionals will sort things out in the time allocated to them. I doubt that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1973, matters were more easily accommodated; authorities were conjoined in a way that was much more easily embraced in relation to staff transfers. However, in 1996 many of the big mainland authorities—the main service providers—will be exploded into a number of constituent authorities that will provide services. Without crystal clear guidelines, there will be confusion. There is a much better case, as I believe the hon. Member for Angus, East said, for including in the Bill—in primary legislation—clearer details about the principles of this process. From the Minister's remarks, I am none the wiser about what the Government expect to happen in this regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am nervous about the timetable and I think that the hon. Member for Angus, East also mentioned that aspect.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>494</span>
The time that is allowed for these difficult and sensitive matters to be tackled by the brand-new shadow authorities immediately after they are elected and the suggestion that everything will be coped with under a flexible system, with matters being left to the best devices and good offices of the new authorities, is a triumph of hope over expectation. Flexibility means uncertainty. The principles should be set out in much more detail than the Minister has given us today. I hope that he can remedy that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister commented on the second part of amendment No. 94. He said that the Government do not anticipate the Secretary of State intervening at will, but inevitably he will intervene when arbitration is necessary. Clause 8(3) specifies that there must be consent from the new authorities to which the employees will be transferred and that "failing such consent" the Secretary of State is involved by definition. I agree that he does not have the option to supersede decisions, but he is involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is incumbent on the Secretary of State and on the Minister to be much clearer about which provisions will apply in certain circumstances. In the remainder of our debate on this important group of amendments. I hope that the Minister will give us more detail and clothe his statements with illustrative facts relating to real, practical circumstances that the new authorities will meet when facing the difficult prospect of allocating staff throughout the new committees, new offices and new service departments that the Bill will bring into force after 1996.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister, at the end of his speech, hoped that we should be reassured. Far from being reassured, I am greatly alarmed by his speech and by what it entails. I cannot believe that the timetable he suggests can be put into operation without mayhem being unleashed on local government and local government services. I want to know much more about the terms of reference and the job that Robert Peggie is supposed to do, especially as he is to work only one day a week. Perhaps we can return to that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Questions come in 10s, so I want to ask my first five about specialist staff and then ask more general questions about what the Minister said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first concerns the protection of the specialist planning services. The regional councils make a major contribution to specialist planning services, which is well recognised. That is provided by professional planning teams for environmental action in general and for many specialist activities, such as archaeology. How will those services be provided for? How will transfer arrangements be conducted to ensure that they do not involve the loss of those specialist services?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That matter greatly affects Lothian, Strathclyde and, doubtless, the other regional authorities. Therefore, I hope that the Minister can say something about that. Letters are unsatisfactory: they are unpublished in 	<i>Hansard.</i> The Minister should comment on how the transfer arrangements will be conducted to ensure that they do not involve the loss of specialist services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second question concerns the specialist staff who are involved in the preparation of structure plans. The Government have recognised the need for a structure to be prepared for areas that cover more than one authority. That recognition is in the White Paper, and I do not think that there is any dispute between us about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0279">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>495</span>
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances is not it appropriate to ensure that the existing specialist skills and resources—for example, databases—relating to the existing structure plans that apply to any such area, are retained for that area?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the joint planning in Lothian and Strathclyde, how are the staff not to be dissipated? The dissipation of staff is a real worry. My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central, who knows the organisation of Fife well, and was very involved in it as local government leader, knows the great importance of planning staff in any authority. It will be no surprise if I ask about the Lothian planning staff in particular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, is not it also agreed that the joint planning areas should be defined in advance of the Act, to allow the requirement for joint working to be reflected in transfer arrangements of the new authorities? That would involve modification of clause 8(2) to ensure that the transfer of specialist structure plan units to a new joint structure plan mechanism is required and should be in accordance with clause 33. What will be done in advance?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fourth question is how certain major environmental initiatives are to be safeguarded during the transition. Regional councils already have a key role in securing and initiating environmental action, in particular in the green belts and in the successful, prizewinning conurbation strategy of Strathclyde. I do not believe that the transitional arrangements can be made anything like as quickly as the Government seemed to suggest this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final question on specialist services is concerned with regional parks. The Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) will recollect that at the prompting of Mr. Tom Huxley, some months ago, I wrote to him about the Pentland hills park. His reply, roughly, was, "Sufficient unto the day". The day has come. We want to know what proposals the Bill contains to implement the effective transfer of staff and resources for the regional parks of Scotland. Hitherto, Lothian region has done an estimable job. Different authorities and the City of Edinburgh's lack of direct authority will be a different kettle offish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My sixth question is a rather more general one. In view of the importance of the transfer of staff from existing local authorities to the new authorities, in what circumstances might the Secretary of State decide not to issue a transfer order covering all staff?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will be aware that in the previous reorganisation of local government in Scotland, the scope of the transfer order was set out in the Act and provided for the transfer of all employees in post on the transfer day. I did not think that the answer that was given to the hon. Member for Angus, East was at all convincing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My seventh question is can the Minister explain why the approach taken in the last reorganisation to protect the job security of local government employees has not been adopted under this measure? Just saying that the decision will be left to them is passing the buck—it will not do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will also be aware that in the last reorganisation of local government in Scotland, the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>496</span>
general protection of employees' terms and conditions of employment on a "no less favourable" basis was provided for in the 1973 Act. My eighth question is can we have explained to us why the Minister has chosen not to provide a similar level of protection in the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will recognise that, prior to tranfer day, the shadow authorities will need to make appointments to senior posts. My penultimate question is can the Minister indicate the protection that would apply in circumstances in which the new authorities' terms and conditions of employment provide for a lower remuneration package than the relevant officers currently enjoy? Frankly, a great deal of nonsense was talked last time about people being paid bonanza salaries. I can understand why a Government would not want such publicity to be repeated. But there is a genuine problem regarding the circumstances which I have outlined, and I hope that that it has been thought about and taken care of.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the Minister will be aware of the general principles relating to transfers, which are derived from the European Community acquired rights directive and the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981. My final question is whether the Minister agrees that those principles should apply to local government reorganisation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is deeply unsatisfactory for the Minister to say that he will reply by letter to such precise questions. Frankly, unless they can be answered, nothing will persuade us that the Government have thought out what they are doing. I say again to the Government Whip and other hon. Members that I have been here for 31 years and I have never served on a Committee considering a Bill that, even at this stage, was so palpably ill thought out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I echo what the hon. Member for Linlithgow has said. It is rather late in the day for some of these fundamental questions to remain unanswered. The timetable is becoming a crucial issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the appointment of Mr. Robert Peggie, whose reputation as an individual of the very highest calibre and proven ability is deserved. However, I do not welcome the situation in which he will be placed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After years of discussion, the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 set out the principles of staff transfer and compensation. This Bill does not; it is left to local authorities and to reserve powers on the tightest of timetables. That will cause distress and uncertainty among staff and decision makers at a time when the whole system will inevitably be in a massive state of flux. We are talking about people with mortgages and family responsibilities, who work for what may be the largest employer in their area. These decisions will affect the whole community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last time the timetable followed years of discussion; this reorganisation is being rushed through impossibly fast. What is the Government's timetable for the changes? The Minister must have an idea when these items will slot in as the new authorities take up position. How long have the Government allocated for choosing a chief executive? How long have they allocated for dealing with advertising and meetings and for sifting through short leets. What time do the Government think that the local authorities will need for even that fundamental post? How long will they allow for the creation of departments and for the hiring of staff? In the Government's estimate,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0280">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>497</span>
how long will the new authorities need to make those decisions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must remember that this is unknown territory. There has never been such an implosion of staff, nor such an amalgamation of large and small authorities. The smaller authorities will inevitably be leaner and fitter in their organisation. Larger authorities, by definition, can afford to adopt different staff practices. While a small authority may reward staff trained in word processing skills by an increase in remuneration, a large authority may reward such skills by putting staff on a different and higher grade. What will happen when the two systems merge? Which one will prevail? Even after 20 years of regional government, many of the original anomalies have still not been solved under the present system. That is exactly what will happen if this reorganisation is introduced on a very tight and rigid timetable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can 18,000 regional staff be merged with 1,100 district council staff without problems? That is what will happen in many areas, such as Perth and Kinross. It will be carried out under the tightest of timetables.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1973 Act laid out procedures to be followed. In 1995 it will be left to the vaguer processes of mutual agreement and ministerial order. The Government are saying that an unprecedented staff and service transfer will take place within an extremely short time scale, without prior machinery and principles being clearly laid out in statute. That is a recipe for chaos, unfairness and disaster. I believe that the lessons of the 1973 reorganisation have been ignored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the Government's proposed timetable in detail? What do they believe to be adequate time for authorities to make changes? What will the machinery for staff transfer be, and why is there no such provision in the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to return to information technology in this context. Specialist posts involving skilled individuals will have to be duplicated in many areas, as the personnel might not be available. Where regional systems are unitised, they will have smaller volumes of information but the same complexity. Instead of having one specialised IT member of staff, the post may have to be duplicated in the authorities being created. To that is added the complication that legacy systems can be wound up only when the last district is ready for change. That is another tight timetable constraint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What estimates do the Government have about the wind up or transfer of IT services, and what time are they allocating to local authorities for those changes to be made? Information technology is an essential part of local government This is a major flaw in the Government's proposals, and local authorities will be lumbered with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am told that the staff have a 50:50 chance of early retirement—if they are under the age of 50, no chance; if they are over the age of 50, perhaps. What is the estimated bill for redundancy? How many early retirements and voluntary redundancies do the Government expect? Why, if the Secretary of State is to make staff transfer schemes, can that not be done up front and set out clearly in the Bill? Why is it being left to the chaos and tight timetable that will follow?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is yet another sign of the Government's rush to legislate. The Government have chosen to impose this tight timetable on the system, rather than considering the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>498</span>
needs of the system and the problems of transfer and then suggesting a timetable that suits local government and the needs of the task. To suit themselves, the Government are putting the system in a straitjacket If these matters are not in the Bill, there is no chance of meeting the timetable. How do the Government intend to fulfil all those obligations and meet all those problems within such a timetable, or are they merely putting them on local government's plate and expecting it to work them out? Local government will be working parallel authorities and will be massively stretched just working out the mechanics of this. The Government have been unfair to impose the strictest and tightest of timetables. That simply means that something has to give and I suspect that it will be local government itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members have made two criticisms of the Government's proposals. First, they allege that general principles for the transfer of staff were set out in the previous Act and are not set out in the Bill. Secondly, they say that the timetable is too tight in relation to this reorganisation. I have to say, not as a matter of opinion but as a matter of fact, that both those criticisms are wrong. The general rules were not set out in the 1973 Act, which the hon. Member for Angus, East will discover if he looks at it. In 1973 the principles and the details were set out in transfer orders made under section 216 of the Act. That is precisely what we propose here. Compensation principles were also not set out in the 1973 Act; all the arrangements were by order. Our proposals here are identical to those proposed for a much more complex reorganisation last time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the criticism of the timetable. Our proposed timetable is almost exactiy the same as the one in 1973. The Bill received Royal Assent in October 1973 followed by shadow elections in May 1974 and vesting day in May 1975. That was a far more complex reorganisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that much more consideration was given to reorganisation under the previous restructuring and the putative local authority knew that it was to be established much sooner than on tins round? At the moment audiorities have no idea what will be created.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But they did not last time. They still had to wait for both Houses of Parliament to decide on the boundaries. Parliament made substantial changes to the boundaries proposed by the Wheatley commission. Authorities were in exactiy the same position last time. It is not at all unreasonable for the Government to wait until after consulting local authorities before taking detailed decisions. If we did not do that Opposition Members would be the first to criticise us for taking decisions without consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to respond to some of the detailed points raised by the hon. Member for Linlithgow. In relation to TUPE and the transfers covering all staff and protection of existing terms and conditions, the hon. Member would agree that those points come up specifically under the next group of amendments and perhaps we can delay discussion until then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of the treatment of various specialist staff, again he would not expect me to make
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0281">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>499</span>
announcements without any input from local government As a matter of principle, it must be right for local government to make the key input into the preservation of key services and the arrangement for their staff. Different considerations will apply in different circumstances. We will pay close attention to representations and advice when we prepare the transfer orders setting out the general principles of transfer. The detail must be left to the authorities. I am surprised to hear Opposition Members suggest that central Government should somehow lay down every detail of these proposals. Of course, I do not suggest that the hon. Member for Fife, Central said that, because he did not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The detail must be left to the authorities most closely engaged in the process. I shall take another look at the reasoning behind the amendments tabled by the Opposition, which did not reveal any real difference of purpose between themselves and the Government. In terms of the way in which things are presented, the provisions in the Bill and the timetable, we are following very closely the precedent of the 1973 reorganisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a useful debate. On the basis of what the Minister has said, we are willing to withdraw the amendment. We are keen to ensure that the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow about TUPE and the acquired rights directive are covered in the debate on the next group of amendments. That is probably the most important debate that we shall have today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that the Government have listened to our arguments and that before Report there will be further discussions between the Scottish Office and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities to ensure that the spirit of what has been accepted will be translated into something positive the next time we discuss the issue on the Floor of the House.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 90, in page 4, line 18, at end insert—

to ensure that, to the extent, if any, to which, by reason only of the said Part I of this Act, that person would apart from the order cease on 1 st April 1996 to be in such employment, that person is transferred on 1st April 1996 to the employment of such local authority as may be specified in or determined under the order.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I hinted in the previous debate, the amendments are probably the most significant that we shall debate today. They get to the heart of the fundamental divide between Conservative and Labour Members. The amendments seek to provide for the transfer of all staff to the new authorities on reorganisation. That contrasts sharply with the lack of provision in the Bill to safeguard the future of all employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the previous debate I understood why the Minister found it difficult to avoid talking about the staff commission, the transfer of staff and the implications of the transfer of undertakings. We now need a vigorous debate because the amendments lie at the heart of what we seek to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is complex because the debate is taking place when we are still seeking interpretations of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 and the acquired rights directive of 1977. All staffing matters, whether they relate to competitive tendering or the future of local government, are influenced by those regulations and directives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to transfer all staff to recreate what happened under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 and to avoid the future welfare and careers of employees being bogged down in court procedure. That has been the Government's response to questions about how the transfer of undertakings and the acquired rights directive will apply to employers. In a recent answer to a question from my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), it was again pointed out that the Government see their salvation on those complex issues in the courts. We do not think that the future of 300,000 employees should be dealt with in the courts of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two fundamental issues should govern the Committee's deliberations this morning. First if there was a straight transfer of employees from the old authorities to the new, the confusion and doubt about how people, Government unions and local authorities are interpreting this complex Bill would be overcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0282">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>501</span>
Based on expert advice that has come to our attention from Hamilton district council, it is evident that if the Government do not accept the wisdom of the amendment, they will find during the reorganisation that the TUPE regulations and the acquired rights directive will apply to the transfer of employees from the old authorities to the new. The Opposition are trying to help the Government. We are trying to allow them to avoid the pitfalls of entering a crazed and confused morass of staffing implications by accepting our constructive amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have made great play of the fact that there will be savings from reorganisation, but, in the main, the savings are based on not all staff being transferred to the new authorities. Indeed, the Government have identified more than 2,000 staff who may go in the transfer. If that is the case and the Opposition's argument was accepted, there would be no savings at that point of the reorganistion. Will the Minister comment on that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, boundaries are still chaotic. The Bill's cost implications—especially the Government's figures—are not believed by anyone. The transfer of staff could lead to a further tier of confusion and chaos. Why will not the Government accept the amendment? Our argument prevailed in section 216(2) of the 1973 Act. If it was good enough for all the employees then, why is it not good enough in 1994?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reasons are political and financial. The Government have only one card to play in arguing for the reorganisation: it may save money in the longer term. If the Opposition's argument is correct, it will not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should discuss in detail with Hamilton district council the expert advice that it has sought, not only about the TUPE regulations and the acquired rights directive, but about what would happen post-transfer to employees transferred to the new authorities and still covered by the directive and regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have real problems. It is likely that all staff will be transferred, and under their existing conditions of employment. That is the clear message of the TUPE regulations and the acquired rights directive. Even more worrying for the Government, they assume that councils such as Stirling and Kyle and Carrick will do different things in future and may want to get rid of staff. Our understanding is that even after reorganisation, the directive and regulation may govern further movement of staff for two, three or four years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When faced with that, a sensible Government would say, "We do not want to abandon 300,000 people to the courts. Let's settle it now. Let's accept that if we mean to have a sensible reorganisation, we treat the staff with the minimum of respect that they deserve." That being the case, the Government will find it difficult not to accept the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case is absolute. If the amendments are not accepted in good faith, we fear that we shall have the most confused and chaotic court-dominated reorganisation that the country has ever known. That cannot be right. Parliament would be abrogating its legislative responsibilities if we spurned the opportunity this morning
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>502</span>
of including in the Bill provisions relating to the future of employees and left that for the courts to determine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have nothing against the legal system or the court system. When we, as legislators, have the opportunity to take action, but do not do so, we are letting down not only 300,000 employees, but all people in Scotland who expect morale, loyalties and professionalism to remain high and endure over whatever form the reorganisation ultimately takes. I ask the Government to accept the amendments, which are based on a fair deal for all employees in Scotland. If the debate on staffing is to mean anything, it is that we must look after services and those who provide them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the hon. Member for Fife, Central and agree that the issue is critical. There is no dispute that we must consider the effects of the measures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer the Minister to his previous remarks in which he said that I was wrong to aver that the principles were laid down in the 1973 Act. Will he look at the amendments and note that both are taken from section 216(2) and (3) of the 1973 Act, which established principles? Will he reconsider his remarks? I want such principles to be included in the Bill, as they were in that Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to that. The hon. Gentleman will be reassured if he reads clause 9.I shall specifically deal with his points about the 1973 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 90 would mean that, with possibly few or particular exceptions, all staff employed by existing authorities on 31 March 1996 would transfer to the new authorities. As I understand it, the transferee authority in relation to all staff would be determined either by the transfer order or by a transfer scheme—a local authority scheme—made under that order. The amendment, and amendment No. 91, do not provide for the continuing employment of staff who transferred. That is not a criticism: it is the correct approach. The new authorities should have the ability to select the staffing structures appropriate to themselves. However, I do not believe that amendment No. 90 would achieve a great deal, if anything, that would not in any case happen under the Bill and, in practice, it could have some detrimental effects upon the transfer process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Bill, all staff know that they have a job up to 31 March 1996—subject to their wishing to take voluntary redundancy. Amendment No. 90 would offer, in addition, the prospect of transfer to one of the new authorities. As I have suggested, that transfer offers no guarantee against employees being served with a redundancy notice on 1 April 1996 by their new employer on the grounds that there is no slot for them in the new structure. That does not seem to be a proper policy justification for changing the Bill. It will offer staff no additional long-term security. It might lull them into a false sense of security if the fact was not clear to them. It might act as a disincentive to existing authorities to do everything in their power to manage the transfer process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that, as the hon. Member for Fife, Central has told the Committee, behind the amendments is the question of the application to local government reform of the TUPE regulations. The hon. Gentleman referred to a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0283">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>503</span>
legal opinion that Hamilton district council has received regarding the matter. As he will appreciate, I have not read that. I understand that the amendments are an attempt to remove the complications ofTUPE regulations from the transfer process. I do not think that they achieve that I accept that under the Bill as it is drafted, individual staff members will not know whether they are covered by the TUPE regulations. Some—perhaps most, or even all—almost certainly will be. The only guarantees that can be offered, whether those regulations apply or whether staff are transferred under transfer orders on existing terms and conditions, relate to the act of transfer. None of the processes guarantees continued employment in the new authority. If the regulations applied to certain staff, the new authority would have to be satisfied that any proposal to make such staff redundant could be justified on economic, technical or organisational grounds. If it did not, the justification for dismissal would have to be based simply on the test of redundancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 91 would require that all staff be transferred to the new councils on their existing terms and conditions until notification in writing, of new terms and conditions. It would also provide that a new job that was similar to the previous job should attract no less favourable terms and conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that the amendment is, in effect—to deal directly with the question that the hon. Member for Angus, East leaped up to ask—a copy of the relevant provision of the 1973 Act. The Government, I reassure Opposition Members, have no difficulty with the principle of the amendment. Clause 9 of the Bill, which was not incorporated in the 1973 Act, however, achieves largely the same result as amendment would do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I right in thinking that clause 9 deals only with the continuity of employment of the staff transferred, but not with the substantive issue of transfer itself?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could anticipate what I intended to say about clause 9 later in the debate, as the two clauses are closely related, and explain, in answer to the hon. Gentleman's clear question, what clause 9 does. It ensures that the contracts of any staff transferred by virtue of clause 8(2) will continue intact The contract will continue to have effect after 1 April 1996 as if it had originally been made with the new authority to which the employee is transferred. The clause makes it clear that all the previous authorities' rights, powers duties and liabilities associated with the contract are transferred to the new authority. The provisions of clause 9 do not however, affect any right that a local authority employee may have to terminate his or her contract if there is a deterioration in the terms and conditions of employment. That includes an employee's right to claim constructive dismissal if there is a substantial deterioration in those terms and conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill, as drafted, makes adequate provision for local authority employees without the need for the amendments when one takes into account clause 9 together with the employment law which has developed since the 1973 Act was passed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The 1973 Act set out the basic principles in relation to the transfer of staff from the existing to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>504</span>
the new authorities and the compensation arrangements which would be in place for those who were redundant. Where are those basic principles in the 1994 Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The 1973 Act had a provision which allowed all staff to transfer. I think that the hon. Member is referring to section 216, which does not represent a principle. As with amendment No. 90, it offered no guarantee of subsequent employment. All the true principles of transfer were left to transfer orders, which were then translated into detail by transfer schemes prepared by individual authorities. That is precisely what we propose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's points are helpful, but, we want the Bill to contain an undertaking that all staff are to be transferred. Because subsection (1) states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may by order make provision to"</p></blockquote>
it is uncertain which groups will be the subject of orders, under which conditions and, ultimately, which will transfer to new authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, as the TUPE regulations and the acquired rights directive are the subject of much court action, employees will be in a double bind. They will be subject first to the orders of the Secretary of State and secondly to the possible whims of the courts. That is one of the main reasons why a simple transfer commitment in the Bill would allay employees' fears. Would not the Minister accept that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gendeman and I do not disagree on objectives but we may disagree on the best way of achieving them. The TUPE regulations are a matter of law. It is not therefore possible for anyone to assert that they should or should not apply to local government reorganisation. That can be decided by reference to the facts of each individual case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully acknowledge and sympathise with the spirit behind the amendments. Amendment No. 91, however, would achieve nothing that is not already in clause 9 or already provided for elsewhere in employment law. Amendment No. 90, while seeming superficially to offer greater certainty to staff and seeming possibly to overcome the problems which might arise in relation to the TUPE regulations, in practice achieves nothing of significance beyond what wdl already happen under the Bill as drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I entirely accept the need to offer reassurance to staff, and as much guidance as possible as to what will happen to them. The staff commission will certainly have an important role to play here. The staff commission in England has already been asked to provide guidance on the application of the TUPE regulations and we will look carefully at appropriate parallel action in Scotland. The local authorities have their own role to play in all this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not persuaded by the amendments. In practice there is not a great deal of difference between us. I am happy to give the hon. Member for Fife, Central an undertaking that we will continue to consider carefully any points or arguments that are put to us. It is a technical matter. I assure him that if he is unhappy with any points when he reads my speech in 	<i>Hansard,</i> I shall discuss the matter further with him. The amendments, however, as drafted, would not help the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are technical but important matters. I am not persuaded by the Minister's argument that the provisions of section 216—especially subsections (1), (3) and (4)—of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 give less protection than clauses 8 and 9. They are substantially different; I accept that they must be so because of the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 216 of the 1973 Act gives clear provision for the protection of the interests of officers in relation to transfer. Subsection (3)(a) ensures that an employee
	<br><blockquote><p>"enjoys terms and conditions of employment not less favourable than those which he enjoyed immediately before the date of the transfer".</p></blockquote>
It continues in similar vein. Therefore, there is a dispute and I am not persuaded that the Minister's interpretation of that Act is correct. That is an open and important question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am even less convinced about the circumstances that apply to a current employee who is in dispute about the process of transfer. The Minister's case is founded on the fact that clause 9 provides the necessary protection. I do not believe that it does. Clause 9 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This section applies to any person transferred from an existing local authority".</p></blockquote>
That begs the question about what happens when there is a dispute about the transfer. Suppose that I am an employee who does not want to be transferred from Argyll and Bute to Eastwood because I am a special education adviser and I live in Oban and am happy there. Under the new transfer process, suppose that I am to be posted to Eastwood, which is a right-wing enabling authority, with which I have no sympathy—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Well, it may not be. The elections are yet to—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not enter into dialectical argument with the hon. Gentleman, but the new authority will be called East Renfrewshire and not Eastwood.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am old fashioned about such matters. The name Eastwood has a certain political resonance that will survive for some years because of the iniquity of the proposals. I do not want to pursue that, however, perhaps it was a bad example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand clause 9, if a person is content about the transfer process and goes to the new authority allocated to him, the Minister may be right that that person has protection equivalent to that offered by the 1973 Act. When there is a dispute about that transfer process, however, I do not believe that a person has anything like the protection offered in the 1973 Act. That is the problem that we are trying to tackle. If a transfer is comfortable and everyone is content about the proposals for their future, and if that transfer is made, there is less need for the protection of the 1973 Act. If there is a dispute about the transfer, however, I believe that the Minister is, in legal terms, up a gum tree with his argument. I shall remain convinced of that until he persuades me otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not convinced by the Minister's argument that this is simply a technical matter and that there is no substantial policy difference between the Opposition and the Government. The Minister might believe that I am simply a suspicious type who will not believe anything that Tory Ministers, especially this Minister, tell the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>506</span>
If hon. Members examine amendment No. 90, they will see that there are perhaps good reasons why I should be suspicious of what ministers tell us. As has been said, the amendment would incorporate the provisions of section 216(2) of the 1973 Act. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) quoted from section 216.I am grateful to the Minister for making available to me a copy of the 1973 Act. There is, however, no subsection (2) in my copy of the Act, just a line with a series of dots. I cannot say whether the amendment incorporates the exact wording of the 1973 Act, which has been deleted in my copy and, I assume, in the copy of the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is amended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see, it is amended as well. I was naturally suspicious that the Minister had doctored my copy so that I would be at a disadvantage to other members of the Committee. Perhaps I do not have grounds for suspicion about that, but there is still reason to be suspicious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is not happy with the amendment because it does not guarantee subsequent employment. In 1973, people were not worried about subsequent employment following local government reorganisation. They worked and lived in a different atmosphere from that in which people have to operate nowadays. There are deep suspicions that the local government reorganisation is in reality about taking away the jobs of those currently employed in local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister admitted in previous debates that he and the Government expect employment in local government to be reduced as a result of the Bill. He gave the figure of up to 2,000 fewer local government employees after reorganisation Not only is there no guarantee about future employment under the amendment, but the Minister does not want to give any such guarantee because it is part of his agenda to ensure that the employment level is lower after the reforms than before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If members of the Committee think for a minute about what is proposed, it is inevitable that there will be fewer local government employees if the Bill is passed. The Government want to abolish a tier of councils in Scotland—regional councils will disappear. They are not abolishing the functions of regional councils. They will exist alter the reorganisation, but the Minister wants them to be transferred to new bodies such as unitary authorities, water boards, joint boards and joint committees. The Minister hopes that, during that process, he will shed 2,000 Scottish local government jobs. That is why the Opposition felt obliged to table the amendment and ask the Minister to assure the Committee that it is not the Government's intention for the number of local government jobs in Scotland to be reduced solely as a result of the reform. I doubt that the Minister will give such a guarantee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be happy for the amendment to be withdrawn if the Minister would say that his problem was with the drafting and that he wanted to ensure that exactly the same number of local government employees were in work on 1 April 1996 as on 31 March 1996. He should undertake to bring forward an amendment on Report to achieve that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister will not give such an assurance, it must be concluded that he wants to ensure that a number of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0285">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>507</span>
local authority employees will not transfer to new authorities on 1 April 1996 and that he wants them on the dole, kicked out of a job and no longer a burden on the public expenditure of the country. That is the real motive and why there is a genuine difference between Opposition Members and the Government. We do not accept that up to 2,000 local government employees are superfluous and do not fulfil any role. The functions of local government will continue to exist after 1 April 1996 and so should the jobs of the officers who implement services in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman accept that certain functions are duplicated between regions and districts, perhaps in administration, law or finance? Changing from two tiers to one will therefore mean that although a function is still carried out, only one department will exist instead of two. There is likely to be a reduction in staff numbers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman used a bad example when he referred to finance. In my area, Dundee district council and Tayside regional council both have finance departments, but the activities that they carry out are very different. Tayside regional council collects the council tax and it collected the poll tax. When that council disappears, who will collect the council tax?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After reorganisation, there will be three new finance departments: in Dundee, in Perth and Kinross and in Angus. All the existing officers who serve on those authorities cannot perform the function of collecting the tax. They have not done it in the past, it has never been their responsibility and they do not fully understand it. Therefore, there would still be a role for those in Tayside regional council who have the expertise and knowledge of the computer system. Therefore, they know what has to be done to collect the council tax. The other authorities have never collected the tax. Sometimes they have assisted Tayside regional council, but they have never done that job on their own. They will need the help of the regional council's officers. Similar cases will occur right across Scotland. Everyone who works for a regional council is carrying out an essential role. They will continue to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that, under the reorganisation of Tayside regional council finance department, the position is likely to be worse than he suggested? It is likely that each of the three new district councils will require the level of expertise presently held by Tayside regional council. Indeed, that will result in the duplication of the Tayside structure within each of the three authorities and in the employment of more rather than fewer staff.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair comment. It is called "triplification" if there is such a word. It will occur many more times than that if we apply it across Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that Conservative Members have not properly thought out this issue. Regional councils do not carry out duplicated functions. They fulfil a different role from district councils. Officers working for district councils do one thing while officers working for regional councils do something completely different. That work will continue to be done after reorganisation. The functions will not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>508</span>
disappear simply because, on a piece of paper, the Committee decides that there will be 30 authorities when there used to be 65.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will be surprised to find that I agree with him. Certain functions will continue and they must be considered. The cost aspect of them is important. However, I would not have picked Tayside regional council's finance department and the system that it uses as an example. It is a unique system that no one would wish to emulate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As usual, the hon. Gentleman is free with the abuse that he heaps on Tayside regional council without being specific about his complaints. General inferences that, in some way, the council is falling down without saying in what way are less than honourable. If he wishes to attack a specific aspect of the council's finance department, he should do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was dealing specifically with the unique system that Tayside regional council has for collecting the community charge. The hon. Gentleman must realise that no one else has that system. As a business man and as someone who has studied the matter, I tell the hon. Gentleman that that system was not the one that other councils opted for. The system is unique and it is hardly likely to be used elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman should suggest that Tayside regional council has a system for collecting the community charge. If it has, it is the only council in Scotland to have one. The community charge was abolished some time ago. Regional councils now collect the council tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been problems with the way in which Tayside regional council collects the council tax. I have intervened to try to persuade the council to change the way it does that and to bring it more into line with other local authorities in Scotland. If the hon. Gentleman was constructive rather than destructive towards the council and did not insult it all the time, he might have had more success.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman not aware that there is still a backlog of claims for the community charge? Regional councils are still pursuing them. Does he not acknowledge that it is thanks to the Labour Members who encouraged people not to pay the community charge that those problems were created?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there are problems with collecting the backdated community charge, or poll tax—let us call it by its real name—the blame should be firmly placed on those who introduced it and who were warned that billions of pounds of public money would be wasted in trying to collect it. The Government ignored the Opposition then, and are ignoring now our warnings about this Bill.

It is time that Conservative Members stopped trying to blame everyone else for their mistakes over the past 10 or 15 years in Scotland. The mistakes are their fault; they are not the fault of regional councils or of other political

parties. Who have been in office for the past 15 years in Scotland? Who are responsible for the mess that we are in?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I encourage the hon. Gentleman to pursue his strong original point about the triplication of services, the extra costs and the staff disruption that the Bill will cause. I believe that Tayside region's computer system is absolutely dedicated to the collection of the community charge. If that service is transferred to the three new councils, that will mean new systems and massive extra expense. Have the Government even begun to include that in their estimate of costs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an excellent point and as such will fall on deaf ears because Conservative Members do not want to listen to common sense. They want only to make cheap political points at the expense of local councils that are not in their political control. That is where they fall down when considering local government. They have never taken a dispassionate, objective look at what needs to be done to deliver local government services to the people of Scotland They always try to squeeze out the political advantage to the detriment of local government in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he has no difficulty with the principle of amendment No. 91, which will be news to civil servants working for central Government who, for yeas, have seen the Government try to edge their way out of the implications of TUPE and unwilling to ensure that the right principle of the EC acquired rights directive and of TUPE is applied to all posts that are transferred under market testing and privatisation programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 90 and 91 should be considered together. The Minister said that clause 9 effectively implements amendment No. 91. I do not think that he is correct. The notes on clause 9 state;
	<br><blockquote><p>"any of the staff transferred by order to the new councils who are not covered by the 1981 Regulations will retain their existing contracts.".</p></blockquote>
As I argued about amendment No. 90, the Government intend that thousands of staff will not be "transferred by order", but will simply lose their jobs. Therefore they are not covered by amendments Nos. 90 and 91.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said about amendment No. 90 that there was no agreement of subsequent employment. Even under clause 9 there is no guarantee that in future the wages and conditions of people who transfer to the new authorities, the water boards or the new residuary bodies will be maintained. What happens to their wages and conditions will be determined by the money that central Government make available to the new authorities. If there is not enough money, wages and conditions will gradually deteriorate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister argues that the staff commission, the local authorities and the Secretary of State for Scotland should agree how best to protect staff as they transfer from the old to the new authorities. He argues for maximum flexibility and tries to paint himself as the flexible friend of local authorities. They will not be convinced. Opposition Members are not convinced. When he argues in that vein, he is really saying that, ultimately, everyone should trust the Tory Secretary of State for Scotland. At the end of the day, the staff commission is just an advisory body. It cannot tell the Secretary of State what to do, it cannot
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>510</span>
negotiate with him and it cannot make him agree to something that he does not want The Secretary of State can listen to its advice, but he can also ignore it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not doubt that Mr. Peggie is an exceptional individual whose integrity is beyond question—although his judgment may be questionable if he thinks that Hearts are a good team. However, he will not be able to influence the Secretary of State in any way that the Secretary of State does not want to be influenced. It is okay to appoint staff commissions and honest men as their chairmen, but they cannot force the Secretary of State into doing anything that he does not want to do. We must remember that when considering what should be included in the Bill. If the position is flexible, decisions will ultimately be left to the Secretary of State and not to the staff commission which he argues will play an important role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that nominations for the com mission had been received from COSLA and from STUC. It is one thing to receive nominations, but another to accept them. Will the Minister guarantee that those nominations will be accepted? Which other bodies have made nominations? I should like to know what advice they are giving. Those other bodies could mean the Scottish Conservative party or retired, or defeated—most Tory candidates in Scotland are defeated—and Tory ex-Members of Parliament who are looking for other positions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if local authorities are given a role in the staff commission, that role cannot be decisive. Local authorities are creatures of statute and can only do or not do what Parliament allows them to. Their ability to defend their staff will depend on the money that the Secretary of State makes available to them. If they do not have the money or the power and cannot control the Secretary of State, it will be up to the Secretary of State to defend people's wages and conditions when they transfer to the new authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given their record over the past 15 years, which has verged on hatred toward local government in Scotland, I do not think that any Tory Secretary of State for Scotland or any Tory Member of Parliament can be trusted with the future of local government employees. Let us consider the Government's track record over the past 15 years. They were continually in conflict with local government by curbing its expenditure, capping its ability to raise taxes, forcing down its throat CCT and telling authorities to do things that they did not want to do. It is not credible for the Government suddenly to turn round.and ask us to trust them to look after the interests of local authority employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was struck by the fact that the Minister and the hon. Member for Ayr took the line that such matters should be left to local authorities. Can anyone believe those two? In horror pictures, when a young couple are driving through a forest and come across a big castle whose gate is opened by someone who looks like a fiend and says, "Come in", I wonder why they always believe him and go in. The Minister and the hon. Member for Ayr are saying to local councils, "Come in, and believe us when we say that we can look after your employees' interests". Those councils would be mad to believe them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Tayside, North showed the true face of the Tories' attitude to local authorities when, in an early intervention this morning, he said that if matters were left to local authorities it would mean jobs for the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>511</span>
boys. He said that the Government would not allow them to do that, that they would ensure that there were no big salary increases and that people would be thrown out of jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish that the hon. Gentleman had listened carefully to me. No one can deny that the same council continued in office in Fife, but the officers got substantial increases in salary because of the changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has failed to point to a proven case of abuse of public expenditure by one of the local authorities successful in 1973. He continually makes implications about Fife regional council without substantiating what he says. Until he does that, the Committee cannot take seriously him or his arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been asked to believe that the Government have accepted the principle that local authority employees should not suffer as a result of local government reorganisation and that their wages and conditions will be exactly the same in future. I remind the Committee that this is the same Government who for some years have been attacking the civil service. Their attitude towards it must be examined to determine whether that attitude will prevail against local government staff in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The prior options test is applied by Ministers to every activity of the Government. They first ask of every Department whether a function can be abolished. If not, they ask if it can be privatised and given away to their friends in the private sector. If not, they ask whether it can be put out to tender direct to the private sector. If not, they ask if it can be market-tested. That gives the public sector a chance to compete to retain the jobs in the public sector. Only finally will Ministers ask whether the jobs can be kept in the public sector and paid for by the public purse. If that is the Government's attitude to their direct employees, what will be their attitude to local government employees, for whom they are not directly responsible?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The advantage offered by local government to Ministers is that the Government create the conditions in which local councils have to sack employees, cut their wages or alter conditions. The Government force councils into that situation. The Minister and the Government cannot be trusted with the future of local government employees in Scotland. If the Committee wants to protect their futures, protection will have to be included in the Bill. Members of the committee should not take any of the nonsense from the Minister that he can be trusted, will look after the employees and bring forward amendments on Report. Amendments on Report will be debated for 10 or 15 minutes. We have time to debate the issues in Committee and should ensure that proper safeguards are provided for the 300,000 local government employees who are worried about their futures.

Erik Cramb is the industrial chaplain in Tayside. He goes to factories to talk to people, and also speaks to the staffs of local authorities. He wrote to me stating that, one morning, he had had coffee with lawyers who worked for Tayside regional council. They discussed their uncertainty about what their futures might hold because of what is happening. Mr. Cramb wrote that one of the lawyers said something like
	<br><blockquote><p>"'Sure there will be jobs for us in private law firms or whatever, but I took a conscious decision to come in here because I didn't just want to make money, I believed in public service!' "</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>512</span>
That is the sort of person who works in regional councils. Such people have committed their lives to them and their futures are in doubt because of the Bill. Conservative Members should think about such people when they vote on the amendment. If they think that those people's futures can be left in the Minister's hands, they do not know the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting to hear some members of the Committee weave their fantasies. On Second Reading I had the image of the Minister as Mr. Bumble because I saw the Bill as a Victorian scenario. I had the image of the Minister of State, at the Department of Employment, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), as Mr. Scrooge. However, the Committee has been taken in a different direction. The Minister is cast as Dracula, or Frankenstein, I am not sure which.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee is going down some sort of yellow brick road. I leave it to members of the Committee to guess who is the tin man and the straw man. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Yes, and the mad professor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Minister of the things that he said in praise of Robert Peggie, who will be the chair of the commission. He said that he was universally respected. That brought to mind the warm phrases that a certain former Prime Minister used about Ministers, when giving "full support". 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Unassailable, yes. Such phrases were usually used just before Ministers were sacked. They are rather like the words used by the Minister about local government staff. He told us how they do a grand job, are not under attack and are safe in the Government's hands. The reality is that a large number of them will not have employment in 1996. It is the hope of the Government that the Bill will reduce the number of people working in local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lots of throwaway phrases such as "jobs for the boys" and "the gravy train" are used, but when I was in local government I did not find such things. The Government's crazy boundary-driven exercise is inviting the setting up of small authorities to "enable". We discussed whether councils would volunteer to take that model or whether it would be forced on them. I argued that somebody who was elected and decided to go down that path, no matter how lunatic or crazy, could then be judged by the public. When authorities are set up with no co-option they will be forced to go to the market—to give up the provider model and seek another model. Without doubt, that will result in the loss of staff. That is what the measure is all about, and why it is important to pass amendments Nos. 90 and 91, which are the same as sections 216(2) and 216(3), respectively, of the 1973 Act.

Section 9 is not sufficient. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, who is not in his place now, put the point well when he said that the clause relates to any person who is transferred from an existing local authority. It does not guarantee that all members of staff will be transferred. From amendments Nos. 90 and 91 it is quite clear that Opposition Members want people to be guaranteed the transfer. That is necessary because all the analysis shows that it is a myth that staff will not be required. The Government are now perpetuating that myth.

The history of local government—leaving aside the attacks on local authorities that my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) outlined—shows, as does my and my colleagues' experience in local government, that the Government have dumped many more responsibilities on to it. In the 1980s it was given many new responsibilities. Local authorities are still trying to work their way through every piece of legislation that the Government have forced on them. Many of those pieces of legislation force local authorities to take on staff. The transfer of responsibilities even for such things as housing benefit distribution, duties for which were loaded on to local authorities from central Government Departments, meant that more and more people had to be taken on. The myth that there will suddenly be 31 authorities that will be cheaper and that will have fewer staff than the present authorities is not borne out by analysis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The analysis done by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy showed that with 24 authorities it might be possible to break even but that as soon as numbers start to drift above 24 it is unlikely that local authorities will be cheaper to run. The Government have ignored that. Therefore it is necessary to have the protections that we want to build in to the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard previously about the lunatic behaviour of the aspiring minimalist council in Kyle and Carrick. Perhaps that has been focused on too much. There are odier councils aspiring to get to the head of the queue in the lunatic Olympics, radier like Eddie the eagle, who was determined to shoot down that slope and take off into the wide blue yonder, usually ending up in a disaster at the bottom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see that Stirling district council, encouraged by the Minister, the hon. Member for Stirling and, no doubt, by members of the Conservative party, is already on the Scottish slopes shooting down towards the crash at the bottom. It took to sacking its solicitors and transferring legal services out. It is at present involved in an industrial tribunal with the two solicitors. It is important to add that they are two female solicitors. Everything is written in terms of "he", but there are many women working in local authorities, giving very good services to the public, who are not mentioned because we use the term "he" all the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A council that aspires to adopt the Government's enabling idea is in the throes of an industrial tribunal. Services were transferred to a legal firm which admitted at the tribunal that the matter was a clear case of redundancy. The point is that Stirling has to go along the road that the Government indicates—to make people redundant—probably against local government common sense. The interesting point about that—and I hope that you will not mind me referring to a previous debate, Sir James—is that if the people concerned had gone out to work for the private sector doing the same jobs and giving the same legal advice, they could have stood for election to the authority. It is nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to safeguard people such as those solicitors by using amendments Nos. 90 and 91, so that when the changeover takes place in 1996, they are guaranteed a transfer to the new authorities. It is not right that people who give their service to local government should worry about taking on commitments. People in local government in Scotland do not know who will not go on
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>514</span>
the payroll of the new authorities, and there is already an indication that they are not taking on commitments. In fact, they are disengaging from economic activity in fear of what will happen if this matter is left to the Secretary of State and they do not have the safeguards contained in amendments Nos. 90 and 91.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister himself said that there is no central plan by the Secretary of State for the transfer. That means to me that practically no idea exists of how it will take place. There is a contradiction: on one hand, employees are being told, "Leave it in our hands; we will look after you." On the other, the Government quite clearly want enabling authorities not to take on staff but to get rid of them and go to the private sector for their services. Perhaps that is the ideological struggle going oh within the Conservative party at the moment. I would like to see the Secretary of State indicate that he has won that ideological battle for common sense and does not see the market as the provider of services in even the smallest authorities, but sees the local authority as the provider of services. If he does, he must take on board amendments Nos. 90 and 91, because the local authorities will need the staff, as all the analysis that has been done shows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to the CIPFA analysis for COSLA to show what happened in local authorities in England and Wales to try to convince the Minister that he should accept amendments Nos. 90 and 91 and that he will not be able to get rid of staff. Research identified that in the English metropolitan counties 3,000 staff were made redundant. Yet, at the end of the day, there was a net increase in staff of between 500 and 1,000. That is the reality of reorganisation. It cannot be done cheaply or without staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Touche Ross report shows a gross turnover of about 1,900 staff in Scotland. Expert actuarial advice suggests that a figure in excess of 4,000 may be the final figure for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we look at the analysis that has been done authority by authority it is likely, unless there is a sudden switch to the market model, that there will not be a great saving in staff numbers. The aspirations that have been voiced again and again that departments will come together and that they will somehow run with fewer staff than before is just such a myth. We are talking in terms of a staff turnover ofbetween 1,900 and 3,500. The CIPFA analysis is that that will cost local authorities quite a bit of money. It will not be a case of staff leaving and no staff coming in—staff will be taken on to fill positions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have looked in detati at the excellent Pieda analysis of Central region, which I have referred to before and which, I am sure, the Minister and his officials have read with interest. It contains a number of proposals, one of which the Government still have on the table. I hope that they wtil think again about it. Even if they do, and opt for the Clackmannan-Stirling and the Falkirk options, the figures will not change. The hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch) talked about bringing together new support staff—people we might call indirect staff. The direct staff, who deliver the services, will probably be affected only by a switch to the market model or by changes that would come about anyway, regardless of whether we change the structure of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Pieda analysis says that 1,493 members of the indirect staff involved in central support services in Central region will be required under any of these models. The analysis comes up with a figure: unless we opt for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0289">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>515</span>
having one authority—Central region authority or a central Scotland authority—1,495 members of staff will still be required. The net figure means that two additional staff will still be required to run the corporate services. I do not think that Pieda was trying to let us have an impression that would argue for a central Scotland model: I think that it was also trying to carry out an objective and rigorous exercise. I hope that the Minister and his officials have looked at that and realised that it stands up to scrutiny. The reality is that under that option, two extra staff would be needed in the two-authority model for central Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we do an analysis of the cost of that model, the value is an additional cost of £5.9 million over the 20-year period of the analysis. That is a reference to page 10, paragraph 3.14 of the document. Further analysis gives us the additional annual cost of £5.2 million in terms of indirect staff costs for corporate services, which are those that people think would waste away when local authorities are combined. That leads me to the conclusion that local authorities require all of the staff that they have at the moment. If authorities are to do the job in the same way by direct delivery, they will require the staff to be transferred in full to the new authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If after that time, some authorities believe that they have a mandate for lunacy and think that they can go down the market road, they will be challenged by the public in an election. However, they may act in that way and the time may come when they will end up making people redundant. Employees should have the right to be transferred to the new authorities, which should take them on and consider the model by which they want to deliver local government services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall come to the clauses that deal with the role of community councils, which are much less important in local government then they should be. Clause 23 covers decentralisation and that is much less important in local government that it should be. It appears that the Government's aspiration is to put services and control down to local people. That cannot be done without putting staff down to local people. Surely, we are not talking about an amateur system run by voluntary secretaries and voluntary members on local committees. We are talking about putting some of the central corporate staff down to the local level. Those people, and possibly more, will be required if we are to deliver the services properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the analyses carried out by Pieda, CIPFA and others and the facts of what happened during reorganisation of local government in England are relevant, the Minister will be required to give people the type of safety and security that they should have so that they know that the same rights that were given to people in 1973 will appear in the Bill. If the Minister does not do that, people will
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>516</span>
live in fear for two or three years and a great deal of instability in local authorities will be created. I hope that the Minister will do more than say that there will be something in the Bill that may or may not look in the direction that we want to go. He should accept that we need the same protections for staff as we had in the 1973 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. There was a rather disturbing report in the press at the weekend about the proceedings of the Committee, which I ask you to look into. Lord Fraser of Carmyllie was extensively reported as saying that the Opposition were in favour of the Bill and, in particular, of the boundaries because they had voted against proposals only three times. In fact, one of those votes was on clause stand part so it was clearly against all the boundaries. It is upsetting and disturbing that a Minister of State at the Scottish Office should misrepresent the proceedings of this Committee. I would be grateful if you, Sir James, would look into that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
