	<p>[MR MICHAEL J. MARTIN 	<i>in the Chair]</i></p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Local Government etc. (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I take points of order, I inform the Committee that some defective copies of the Bill have been printed—[HON. MEMBERS: "All of them."] Perhaps. On page 116 of the true Bill—this relates to schedule 1 and it is important—the top line should read
	<br><blockquote><p>"Lenzie/Waterside district ward in"</p></blockquote>
and the very bottom line on that page should read
	<br><blockquote><p>"More Drive, then rejoining and".</p></blockquote>
That is what appears in the true, authentic version of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I raise an important matter on which I seek your guidance and on which I hope you would also seek the guidance of Madam Speaker.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill's long title runs to 21 lines, yet, despite its length—it is a long "long title"—it omits one important consequence of the Bill; its effect on the parliamentary Boundary Commission process. Madam Speaker chairs the Boundary Commission both north and south of the border and I know that she jealously guards its independence. The Bill openly and brazenly gerrymanders local government boundaries, but it does more than that, because the Government's secret agenda conflicts with the Bill's long title. The present building blocks used by the parliamentary Boundary Commission are regional council wards. In the past, those regions have also been used as the starting points for the calculation of theoretical entitlements to parliamentary seats.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timothy Kirkhope (Lords Commissioner to the Treasury)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I shall consider whether it is a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without the regions and the regional councils, which this Bill would abolish, a new basis for calculating both those crucial components must be found. The long title of the Bill does not mention that most important consequence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The parliamentary Boundary Commission is bound by the rules governing the redistribution of seats which form schedule 2 to the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986. Paragraph 4(1)(b) of that schedule states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in Scotland, regard shall be had to the boundaries of local authority areas".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>194</span>
Paragraph 4(2) goes on to state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In sub-paragraph (1)(b) above"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the one that I have just quoted—
	<br><blockquote><p>"'area' and 'local authority' have the same meanings as in the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973."</p></blockquote>
I have carefully examined the schedule of measures repealed by the Bill, but I cannot find the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986. That Act is relevant to the Bill, however, because it refers—in terms of the rules for the Boundary Commission—to the 1973 Act, which will be repealed by the Bill. Schedule 14, the repeals schedule, contains no mention, however, of the 1986 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that this has nothing to do with you, Mr. Martin, but I know that the Government's motive is to set in place a blueprint for Conservative-friendly boundaries in the future. That may not be your business, Mr. Martin, but the business of the House, of Madam Speaker and of you as her representative, Mr. Martin, is the integrity of the parliamentary process and of the Boundary Commission process. I want to know whether that process will be infringed, despite the fact that it is not referred to in the Bill's long title.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will you, Mr. Martin, seek the guidance of Madam Speaker to discover whether the fact that that process is not included in the long title of the Bill and that the 1986 Act is apparently neither repealed nor amended by a schedule in the Bill conflicts with the Committee's proceedings?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a lengthy point of order. The hon. Member has raised some complicated matters, some of which have nothing to do with me. I shall give his point of order serious consideration, but he will appreciate that it will probably not be possible to give a ruling on this matter until this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Kynoch 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I raised a point of order on Tuesday, which is reported in column 125 of 	<i>Hansard,</i> when I asked your colleague, Sir James Kilfedder, to ask the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) to apologise to my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie). I have now read what the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley said about my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"His constituents know that the hon. Gentleman represents not them, but Scottish Power".—	<i>[Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 8 February 1994; c. 125.]</p></blockquote>
That is a slur on my hon. Friend. The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon valley should withdraw that comment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for raising that point of order. I take a dim view of such remarks. I hope that there will be no further use of such language.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tarn Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. The 	<i>Hansard</i> reporters and production team do a wonderful job. If we are to sit late into the night on Tuesday, however, would it be possible to have the 	<i>Hansard</i> report by the end of Wednesday?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many contentious issues were raised at the end of our sitting on Tuesday night, not least by my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley. I apologise to him and he knows why. We raised the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0115">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>195</span>
question of headquarters. When we discuss future amendments, will the Government give us some information about headquarters? After I had read column 190 of 	<i>Hansard,</i> I telephoned Richard Blackburn, the chief executive of Banff and Buchan district council at St. Leonards, Banff and Michael Barron of Gordon house, Inverurie, who is the chief executive of Gordon district council. Neither of them know where the headquarters of the new Aberdeenshire authority will be. They imagined that it would be at Woodhill house in Aberdeen, which is outside their district councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That raises a serious matter of principle. Are headquarters to be sited outside the districts that they purport to represent? It has serious implications for the concept of bringing government closer to the people if the headquarters of the new authorities are located in other district councils. On top of that, the idea of bringing staff into the congested city of Aberdeen from rural areas is ridiculous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member knows full well that he is raising matters that are not for the Chair. I agree that the 	<i>Hansard</i> staff provide an excellent service. I am sure that they will take on board what the hon. Member said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. The provisional selection of amendments relating to Strathclyde and Ayrshire lists amendments Nos. 8, 22, 15 and 16. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister should know better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can I submit to you Mr. Martin, that amendment No. 22 should come before amendment No. 8. My understanding is that, normally, account is taken of the alphabet when two amendments delete the same part of the Bill, or, in this case, schedule to the Bill. To take a vote on amendment No. 22 first would be the logical course. For reasons of logic and alphabetical order amendment No. 22 should come before amendment No. 8.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is some logic in the way in which the amendments have been grouped. Perhaps the hon. Member can consult with the Clerk, which would allow us to get on to the first group of amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order from my hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch). Is it enough for the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley merely to have his knuckles rapped when at column 125 of the 	<i>Official Report</i> he questioned the integrity of my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr and his ability to represent his constituents. Surely the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley should be made to withdraw that remark.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As hon. Members know, the Chairman in Committee has fewer powers than the Speaker in the Chamber. As I said earlier, I would take a dim view of such remarks being repeated in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>196</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. I accept that your powers are not the same as those of Madam Speaker, but could you not suggest strongly to the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley that he voluntarily withdraws those remarks? Had he made them in the Chamber, Madam Speaker would have instructed him to withdraw them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could suggest to the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley that he withdraw those remarks but I have no powers to force him to do so. It is entirely up to him. I have made full and adequate comment on that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker: 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I understand clearly why amendment No. 85 and amendment No. 86 have not been selected and I make no complaint about that. I know that according to the procedures of the House starred amendments are not normally selected. The amendments that have been selected are fairly complex. We are looking at local authority polling areas. Unless one knows the geography in detail there could be problems later. I simply draw attention to the fact that I tabled amendment No. 85 and amendment No. 86 late because I realised that there may be problems. I have no idea what the Committee may decide. My fears may be unfounded but we may have to come back to this on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman states, he is putting the matter on the record. He knows that I have no control over the amendments that are tabled and selected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Several points of order have mentioned my name this morning. I note that the honourable, or should I say the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley has not had the courage to get to his feet to apologise. If it is in your power, Mr. Martin, could you ask him to name the constituents to whom he referred because I believe that no constituents have made representations to him? I suspect that he has raised a fictitious issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Come on George.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have spent 15 minutes on points of order. Several hon. Members have mentioned the remarks made by the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley. I have commented on the matter and I wish to leave it at that. It is up to hon. Members how they conduct themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I see that amendments nos. 67 and 68, which would alter details of the boundaries of the East Renfrewshire local authority, have not been selected. Given that schedule 1 goes into immense detail about precise house numbers and streets in relation to that authority's boundary, I suggest that it is fair enough for minor amendments to take into account individual addresses. I appeal to you, Mr. Martin, to reconsider the selection of those amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Knapman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stroud)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order Mr. Martin. I refer to remarks made from the Chair in the previous sitting that
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is one thing to point out that an hon. Member is a consultant, which he declares in the Register of Members' Interests, but it is another matter to allege that judgment is affected because of the receipt of money."—	<i>[Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 8 February 1994; c. 125.]</p></blockquote>
Does that mean that we are, after all, allowed to refer to the Register of Members' Interests during Committee proceedings?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman is going back over old ground. I am not going to permit hon. Members to read from the Register of Members' Interests. There are no amendments relating to it and it is not a matter for the Committee. I have said that hon. Members may comment upon it in passing if they consider that to be germane to the case that they are making, but the hon. Gentleman must agree that it is unfair to make a point of order about matters on which a ruling has already been made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I shall begin as I do not mean to continue—by being nice to the Minister. I think him for his very courteous and attentive reception of a delegation from Dundee district council yesterday. I was very impressed by how attentively he listened to the arguments put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross), Lord Provost Tom McDonald and Councillor Robin Presswood. I am sure that the case that they made was so compelling that my speech is redundant and that the Minister has decided to accept amendments Nos. 20 and 29. If he nods to show that that is so, I shall sit down. I do not see him nodding, so I shall continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall briefly refer to amendment No. 20, for the benefit of hon. Members who were not privileged to be at the Scottish Office to hear the case in its support. Its sense may not be immediately obvious to all members of the Committee. References to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the unclassified road to Mains of Fowlis",</p></blockquote>
to "Liff Village", the "curtilage of 'Fetlar'" and the "boundary to Blairfield Road" may not be immediately clear to hon. Members. I exclude from those hon. Members the hon. Member for Tayside, North, of course, who knows, sees and understands everything. I am often reminded, having served on many Committees with the hon. Gentleman, of Winston Churchill's remark about Sir Stafford Cripps: "There but for the grace of God goes God."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that is as bad as some of the things that have perhaps been said about the hon. Gentleman and others. I have no objection to the funny names that I am called in this place. They usually refer to something that I have done quite well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman will realise, when he mentions the Mains of Fowlis road and others of that kind, that only he and hon. Members such as myself and the hon. Member for Dundee, West know them intimately. For example, the short cut from the main Dundee to Perth road, bypassing Muirhead is used extensively by people such as me who live in Blairgowrie. I know the road well, but others will not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point. The Scottish Office is conscious of the fact not all members of the Committee

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>199</span>
are familiar with the boundaries and local government areas. That is why the maps have been provided for the benefit of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Map 14 is of the city of Dundee district council area. Although the map is printed in my favourite colours, it contains faults that I should draw to the Committee's attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Detail is missing from the map. The inner-ring road, which was completed last year, is absent. The new Watson and Philip development at Riverside is absent. More surprisingly, the Watson and Philip headquarters, the General Accident headquarters and the technology park are absent. I am surprised because they were opened by the Secretary of State for Scotland, but the Scottish Office seems to be unaware of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will also be aware that the word "Invergowrie" does not appear where Invergowrie is, but at Ninewells, where the trams used to stop.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is again displaying his local knowledge and experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The biggest problem with the map is that it gives the impression that the urban area of Dundee is included in the boundaries proposed in the Bill. That is not the case. The urban area of Dundee extends to the east and to the west of the area shown on the map and takes in the critical areas of Monifieth and Invergowrie.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 20 and 29 would put back into Dundee at least part of the area that the new boundaries would take from the city. Their effect would be, first, to restore the electoral district of Monifieth. It is currently part of Dundee district council—it has been so since the council's establishment—and contains 7,861 citizens of Dundee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Monifieth is well within the Dundee travel-to-work area and 92 per cent. of its work force works in Dundee. The area has a natural affinity with Dundee and not with any other community, particularly those in the proposed council of Angus and Mearns. Monifieth should remain as the Wheatley report recommended—an integral part of the city of Dundee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman accepts the citizens of Monifieth as citizens of Dundee, will he accept that the citizens of Monifieth describe themselves as citizens of Monifieth, which is a valid description?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is valid, but to become a citizen of Monifieth is not an option. The alternative facing the people of Monifieth is to remain part of Dundee or to become part of Angus and Mearns. I shall deal with that point later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment would include Invergowrie in Dundee. Like Monifieth, it is a continuation of the built-up area of Dundee. The Wheatley report described both as
	<br><blockquote><p>"areas which are naturally part of the city".</p></blockquote>
The amendments of the hon. Member for Tayside, North, which affect the boundaries of the new Perth and Kinross authority, and those of the hon. Member for Angus, East, which affect the boundaries of the new Angus
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>200</span>
and Mearns authority, do not include Invergowrie. Only my amendments deal with Invergowrie—Dundee wants it to be part of its local authority. The hon. Members for Tayside, North and for Angus, East want to leave Invergowrie out of their areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will recognise that the starred amendments are concerned with the position of Invergowrie. That is why I put the matter on the record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman obviously made a mistake when he tabled his amendments and has since been trying to put it right. Of the amendments before the Committee, only mine provide a future for Invergowrie as part of any local authority area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third area that my amendments would include is an area on the Tay estuary, which is adjacent to the city and on the point of being declared a local nature reserve; negotiations are continuing between the landowners and Dundee district council. The ranger service for the reserve will be provided by Dundee district council. We regard that area as part of Dundee and as integral to its economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fourth area that the amendments would include in Dundee district council is Mylnefield which is, in effect, the distinguished Scottish Crop Research Institute. It has strong finks with Dundee and particularly with Dundee university. It has a close relationship with the Dundee Partnership whose strategy for reviving Dundee's economy involves joint ventures between the Scottish Crop Research Institute and commercial bodies in Dundee. Almost all the 500 workers at the institute live in Dundee and regard the institute as part of Dundee, as does the city itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fifth area is Balgarthno, which lies to the west and to the north of Dundee's technology park. The Minister will be well aware of the success of the technology park in turning Dundee's economy around. It has established Dundee's western perimeter as the quality location for high-amenity, single-user sites and is vital for the future economy of Dundee. We must build on that success. The only way to do that is to extend the park into Balgarthno, which I understand has already been brought under the ownership of Scottish Enterprise on Tayside. Therefore, it is crucial that that area again becomes part of Dundee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The area includes also three major hotels: the Swallow hotel; the Beefeater restaurant, which has accommodation, and the Denhead of Gray, which is currently being upgraded. They are vital to Dundee's tourist infrastructure. We are trying to market the city as a conference centre. Indeed, we hope to attract the Scottish Conservative party conference to Dundee. The hon. Member for Tayside, North may not like that, but we believe that Dundee can offer a better and cheaper deal than Perth. We hope that the Tories, who always want efficiency and to make savings, will come to Dundee and enjoy themselves. We want to market our hotels as a single package, so three of them cannot lie outwith the boundary of Dundee district council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sixth area includes Birkhill cemetery. It may come as a surprise to members of the Committee, but Dundee is running out of places in which to bury its dead. The eastern cemetery is now so full that the paupers' graves, which are centuries old, are being dug up and reused for new burials. That is worrying, but another worry is that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0118">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>201</span>
the privately-owned Dundee crematorium has among the highest crematorium charges anywhere in Scotland or elsewhere in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want to get to the stage when there are no graveyards and people cannot exercise choice, as the Tories would say, in disposing of remains and so have to rely on a crematorium, that charges extortionate fees. There should be competition between cemeteries and the crematorium. That is why Birkhill should remain within Dundee district council. The local Conservative councillors have drawn that fact to the Minister's attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The seventh area is Baldovan, which is adjacent to Strathmartine hospital in the north of the city and has been earmarked by the council for high-quality housing. Dundee lacks the housing necessary to attract top people to the city. The success of the university, and in particular the success of the medical school, is beginning to attract top people to Dundee. The university has written to the council pointing out that Dundee has an insufficient supply of high-quality housing. Therefore, the sites at Baldovan are especially important to the city. The site at Strathmartine hospital, which is owned by a new trust, is about to be put on the market because the trust intends to close the hospital. It is serviced well for electricity, sewerage and water and is ideal for high-quality housing. We hope that the Minister accepts that argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The eighth area covers the barns of Claverhouse and east of Forfar road industrial areas. The barns are needed by Dundee for industrial expansion and they, too, are in the north of the city. They are very good for providing small units, and have already been successfully marketed by the council. Losing them to another council could be a blow to the economic future of the city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final area is the travelling people's site at Tealing. That is some distance from Dundee, although not as far as Westhill is from Aberdeen. It cost £750,000 to build the site, which is managed by Dundee district council's housing department. It took many years of negotiations and fights with local communities to get this site in the first place, and now we are going to lose it. The Scottish Office requires us to find another travelling people's site within greatly restricted boundaries. No one is looking forward to having to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the areas which the amendments would add to Dundee. There is a substantial case for such a measure. The amendments would not restore to Dundee its existing district council boundaries. They would still leave out vast swathes of rural hinterland which are currently part of Dundee district council but which, under the Bill, will move back to Angus and Mearns or Perth and Kinross. We recognise that people in rural areas probably wish to be associated with councils that are more rural in outlook than an essentially urban area such as Dundee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The areas outlined in amendments Nos. 20 and 29 represent the minimum viable boundary that Dundee needs to survive. We are not demanding living space, like Hitler. We do not want Lebensraum for Dundee; we do not want it to spread all over Scotland. We simply want a minimum viable boundary which allows the people who live within the city boundaries to have a reasonable quality of life and the opportunity to find employment in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>202</span>
an area of Scotland which can attract inward investment and be successful. The Minister should listen very carefully to the arguments in favour of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman's arguments; he is making a powerful case for the amendment. However, I have been told that the people of Monifieth are quite sceptical about being included in Dundee. Has the hon. Gentleman any evidence of that? That will be an important factor in my decision whether to support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point and I shall deal with it towards the end of my speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The size of the new council areas is critical. To be viable, councils must be of a certain size; they must have a certain population and revenue base if they are to be successful in delivering local services. Under the proposed boundaries, Dundee will lose almost 17,000 of its present population. That is bound to have an impact on the city's revenue base. If the boundaries proposed in the Bill are implemented, the city simply will not have a viable future. The Minister really must reconsider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Dundee leadership plan, which was recently produced by Dundee district council, was very well received across the city. Party politics did not enter into it. The chamber of commerce endorsed it enthusiastically. Sir James Mellon, the chairman of Scottish Homes—a person in whose judgment the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) has great confidence—thought it an excellent leadership plan. It set a minimum viable target for population in Dundee of between 170,000 and 180,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening to the hon. Gentleman with interest, especially his comments on Sir James Mellon. However, the hon. Gentleman has in the past been a considerable critic of Sir James. Has the hon. Gentleman seen the light?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should know that I am using every argument possible to try to persuade the Minister to accept the amendment. I may appear inconsistent sometimes, but we all have to sacrifice something in the name of Dundee and its future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the boundary changes are not altered in accordance with the suggestions in amendments Nos. 20 and 29 at least, we will be completely unable to reach the minimum viable population target of between 170,000 and 180,000. The vision behind the leadership plan for Dundee that envisages our economy being transformed through a partnership between the public and private sectors and between central and local government, will be put at risk unless the proposed Dundee boundaries are changed and enlarged so that they cover a larger population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The services available to people in Dundee will be put at risk. The effect of a reduced population on grant-aided expenditure will be to reduce it by almost 10 per cent. The district council reckons that it will lose £2,279,000 in grant simply because of the reduction in population. The city of Dundee cannot be expected to sustain that and still deliver services of the highest quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are 13 secondary schools within the boundary of the city of Dundee. I know that Monifieth high will move
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0119">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>203</span>
out under the proposed boundary changes, but that still leaves 12 secondary schools. Not all of those schools are absolutely full. With a population of 150,000, it will not be viable to maintain a network of 12 secondary schools, including three Catholic schools. If the Committee accepts the boundaries proposed for Dundee, in essence it will vote to close some schools in Dundee. A small council that represents fewer than 150,000 people will not be able to keep 12 secondary schools open.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same argument applies to social work services. If one visits the social work department of Tayside region, one will see that the Dundee division has the highest proportion of one-parent homes, a much higher rate of referrals to the social work department and more children under child protection than any other part of Tayside region. Therefore, there is a great demand for social work services within the city of Dundee. Two thirds of the referrals to the out-of-hours service, which is run by the social work department and which is vital to the child protection service, orginate in Dundee. Yet we are expected to believe that a small council serving a population of fewer than 150,000 will be able to maintain the services that are currently run by the much larger Tayside region, which has greater access to resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A letter was sent to me from Angus district council in respect of Monifieth. I believe that a copy has been sent to all members of the Committee. However, I did not receive mine directly from Angus district council, but indirectly from someone who managed to get hold of a copy. Perhaps my copy was lost in the post or the council did not write to me because it recommends that the Committee does not support my amendments. I am suspicious by nature, but I do not know why I did not receive a copy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Angus district council argues that Monifieth should not remain part of Dundee because the people there do not want to. It bases that argument on a letter sent by Monifieth community council to the Secretary of State as a response to his proposals to reform local government. In fact, the Parliamentary-Under Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) wrote to me about that. He repeated that view and said that the Government were suggesting that Monifieth should come out of Dundee and be put into Angus and Mearns because the community council wrote to the Secretary of State saying that it wants that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The community council does not speak for Monifieth. I have a letter from the ex-provost of Monifieth. He states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Angus would become a single tier authority and Monifieth would be administered from Forfar instead of by Dundee.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I cannot see that this situation would be to the benefit of Monifieth … in my opinion, Monifieth has been, and is, well served with Dundee District Council and hope that Monifieth will stay as part of Dundee at reorganisation."</p></blockquote>
The former town clerk of Monifieth wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It appears to me that far from any change being introduced to meet the wishes of the local population it has been devised entirely with the intention of meeting political expediency."</p></blockquote>
To his knowledge, no wide consultation ever took place with the people of Monifieth. No public meetings were organised prior to reorganisation. The people of Monifieth were not consulted about what they wanted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another letter has been written by the Dundee, East Conservative Association. I know that the Minister pays
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>204</span>
special attention to its views because his father is its honorary president. I do not want to stir up family trouble, but his father and that association have made it clear that they are against the Government's proposals to remove Monifieth and the rural areas in Sidlaw and Gowrie from Dundee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not clear that the people of Monifieth have expressed their views on what they want to happen. They have not done so. Monifieth is divided. Some people want it to become part of Angus and Mearns council, but others do not. They want it to remain with Dundee district council, which it has for a long time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am the Member of Parliament who represents Monifieth and I believe in consulting people. May I offer further evidence? A widespread survey of the town was taken and the vast majority were in favour of joining Angus and Mearns and not being part of Dundee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that he can offer evidence, but has not produced it. He has stated that a widespread survey was undertaken. How widespread was it? How many people took part? How typical were they of Monifieth? We do not know. Much depends on what questions were asked. Everyone knows what opinion polls are like.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been sent a letter from the Presbytery of Dundee which states that the Presbytery
	<br><blockquote><p>"Notes the anomalies in the boundaries proposed in the White Paper, especially those affecting the Monifieth and Invergowrie areas.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Recommends that the proposed boundary lines should be looked at again.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Expresses concern about the loss of revenue and other resources which result from the proposed 10 per cent. reduction in the population of Dundee."</p></blockquote>
The letter from Angus district council gives the real reason why it wants Monifieth to be part of the new Angus and Mearns. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Indeed the Council considers the inclusion of Monifieth, a relatively urban settlement,"</p></blockquote>
even Angus district council recognises that Monifieth is an urban area that is part of the urban conurbation which is Dundee—
	<br><blockquote><p>"will enable the new Angus Authority to balance out the service costs which might otherwise have been adversely effected had only the rural area around Dundee been included."</p></blockquote>
Angus district council views Monifieth as a cash cow that will enable it to sustain services in the new Angus and Mearns council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other considerations. How many people in Monifieth are aware that services are currently provided in the main by Dundee district council, for example, the library service, which is unparalleled in Tayside? If Monifieth is taken out of Dundee, Monifieth pensioners will not have access to the nearest library service, which is that provided by Dundee district council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concessionary travel schemes, which allow pensioners from Monifieth to travel by bus to the centre of Dundee to shop, are provided by Dundee district council. In future, they may not have access to the schemes because they will be outwith the Dundee district council area. Was that explained before they were asked if they wanted to leave Dundee?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Access to theatres and the arts is generally provided for the people of Monifieth by Dundee. The Dundee Rep is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0120">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>205</span>
famous and has put on many fine productions. As a treat for my birthday, I am going there on Saturday with my wife and son. We are going to see a play about prostitutes, believe it or not. The choice was my wife's, not mine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The museums, art galleries and theatres provided for the people of Monifieth are provided by Dundee council tax payers. Angus district council was rated in a recent Convention of Scottish Local Authorities survey as the second lowest council spender on arts, theatres, museums and libraries. Angus district council is asking that Monifieth has access to services provided by Dundee without paying towards them. Monifieth would be subsidised by Dundee council tax payers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Angus, East is upset about that, but the Scottish National party in Dundee is 100 per cent. behind my arguments and supports the retention of Monifieth in the Dundee area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am reminded of the words of the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson), who is not in his place. When arguing about Westhill, he made the point that it wanted city services but rural rates. Of course, that is the argument that some people in Monifieth are making. They want access to the services that Dundee provides but do not want to pay for them. They prefer to freeload, but that is not so of everybody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Monifieth high school is one of the most successful secondary schools currently run by Tayside region. If boundaries are changed, it will come under the new Angus and Mearns council. However, in the high school's catchment area, 37 per cent. of the pupils in the feeder primary schools are in the Dundee district council area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The school's rector, Mr. Hector Low, estimates that 50 per cent. of the pupils attending Monifieth high come from the Dundee council area. He thinks that losing them would undermine the school's viability. Mr. Low was credited as the school's founding rector 20 years ago and does not want to be its undertaker. He believes that the boundary changes will undermine the school's viability and that it would be unable to continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It can be argued that an inter-authority agreement is possible and that Dundee council will agree to pay for those pupils in its area who want to go to Monifieth high school. Is the Minister seriously suggesting, however, that a council with 12 secondary schools in its boundary area, many of which are largely empty, will close its own schools while paying for children to attend schools in another council area? In reality, they will not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The future is uncertain for the 50 per cent. of children who currently go to Monifieth high and the 37 per cent. of children at the primary feeders who live in Dundee, but who are in the Monifieth catchment area. If the boundary change goes ahead without any changes to bring Monifieth back into Dundee, the viability of the school must be seriously at risk. Hon. Members who vote to take Monifieth out of Dundee district council must bear in mind that they could be voting to ensure that Monifieth high has no long-term future. That would be an absolute disgrace because it is one of the crowning achievements of Tayside regional council and one of the schools of which we are rightly proud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my arguments have convinced at least some Conservative Members that there is a strong case for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>206</span>
accepting amendments No. 20 and amendment No. 29 and that they will vote accordingly. For those hon. Members who have not followed the arguments, there is a simple map in the form of a jigsaw which is easy even for the hon. Member for Ayr to understand. There are only two pieces to fit in; Invergowrie and Monifieth. As hon. Members will be able to see, they fit in neatly to the city of Dundee. That is how they should remain. I hope that the Committee will accept the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with great care to the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion). He will understand that I do not require his map or his jigsaw pieces. Before I deal with my amendments Nos. 64, 65 and 66, I should say something in general about his comments. He and his hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West will confirm that, in the years that I have been in the House, I have never tried to do any damage to Dundee. I care very deeply for my native city. Matters like Monifieth high school should be considered very carefully. The hon. Member for Dundee, East was right to draw attention to the importance of that fine school. Its future must be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I too have grave reservations about linking parts of Perthshire to Angus in a sort of banana form around the outside of Dundee. Inhabitants of Invergowrie and Longforgan still think of themselves as people from Perthshire. I represent the northern parts of Perthshire and the northern parts of Angus. The Committee should be aware that it is almost as if a wall exists between those two old counties. People in Perthshire have little or no interest in what happens in Angus. For 10 or more years I have tried to build bridges between those two old counties but with great difficulty. As the hon. Member for Dundee, East will recognise some people in Broughty Ferry still find it odd that they are part of Dundee. They think that they should still be part of a different community, as they were a long time ago, but time moves on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East is right to draw attention to the fact that some communities have become part of the bigger city. They are not rural. I think that he would agree, however, that Longforgan, which is mentioned in my amendment, is very rural. The main dual carriageway from Perth to Dundee bypasses Longforgan. In that sense, Longforgan has no direct link with Dundee. There is a vast natural gap between Longforgan and Blairgowrie and then Dundee. The hon. Gentleman might also agree that Invergowrie has comments to make about why it does not wish to be part of Dundee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One reason why I tabled the amendment—it is not quite why the hon. Gentleman thinks that I tabled it—is that I read the other amendments carefully. I thought, and the hon. Gentleman might agree with me when he considers the amendments, that it makes no sense, for example, to split Birkhill and Muirhead. They regard themselves as one community and that should be borne in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I studied the amendments and realised that I had to try to do something, in case the Committee accepted some of the logic. I do not say that about the hon. Gentleman's amendments because I believe that he has gone into the matter with great care and has studied carefully the natural breaks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0121">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>207</span>
However, the hon. Gentleman speaks of the technology park. That park is currently inside the Dundee boundaries and close to the roundabout and the bypass. I understand the wish to extend the technology park; it is a success and one likes to build on success. Incidentally, I am sad that Ford is not there. I do not want to be nasty, but I think that it would have made the technology park that much more successful. If one examines the map carefully, one can see that there is considerable logic in what the hon. Gentleman says about the natural links.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For several years, I represented the people living in Invergowrie when my former constituency, before the boundary changes, was Perth and East Perthshire. In the introduction to the Committee's proceedings this morning, comments were made about old boundaries and regional boundaries. When I was their Member of Parliament, it was clear to me that the people of Invergowrie, as of preference, would have wished to have been in Perth and Kinross district council. Some of that preference, as the hon. Gentleman said, was due to the fact that the rating systems and the rates levied were different. That is an important factor in how people make judgments and decisions.

As the hon. Member for Dundee, East said, housing is also important when considering boundaries. Some very expensive houses are being built in Blairgowrie and those who buy them will commute either to Perth or to Dundee; it is part of what has become a commuter area. When I tried to link Blairgowrie to Dundee, as the majority of people who travelled to work travelled to Dundee, I said that it was a sensible, logical travel-to-work area. However, I did not make any ground. The people wanted a travel-to-work area that linked Blairgowrie with, of all places, Pitlochry and Aberfeldy. Anyone who has attempted to drive along those roads in winter will know that, as of choice, one would not travel to work in those conditions. Nevertheless, those are the kind of problems that arise when we draw lines on maps.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the map, I hope that the Committee will accept that Longforgan is a rural community. It is part of Perthshire and should logically be contained in Perth and Kinross district council. Reasons for the link include schools provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More difficult to sustain is the case for Invergowrie. It is that much closer to Dundee and, as the hon. Member for Dundee, East mentioned, links exist with the Scottish Crop Research Institute, another of the jewels of that part of the world. A close working relationship also exists with the university as part of its work is directly linked to university activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whilst the case for Invergowrie is more difficult to sustain, there is no difficulty in sustaining the case for keeping Longforgan out of Dundee and including it in Perth and Kinross. There is no logic in linking that part of Perthshire with the eastern area beyond Dundee. I know that the boundary commission makes such decisions to get the numbers right, but it does not seem to understand, and never has, the historical factor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dundee is more than just a major city sitting on the Tay. It divided the old Perthshire and Angus like a wall. When an attempt is made to bring balance to the new local authorities, I want Dundee to be of a viable size. I want it to work. I also want proper attention to be given to the interests of the rural communities—people who,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>208</span>
for historical reasons have no wish to be part of a large city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the Committee should consider these points carefully. We reached the right judgments in our earlier debates about Westhill. My hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside made his case eloquently and well and there is no doubt that that influenced the Committee's thoughts. I hope that I have argued the case sensibly for the amendments in my name. I have tried not to be emotional or to attack other amendments. I have tried to examine the logic of the other amendments and to decide whether I could support them. That is what we should do when considering boundaries affecting the new local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should find it extremely difficult to argue in or out of Dundee that Longforgan should be part of Dundee. I do not believe that anyone living in that part of the world, whether Dundonians or people from Longforgan who consider that they come from Perthshire, can support any case other than that Longforgan should be part of Perth and Kinross. There is no logic in making it part of Angus, because it has no affinity with it, or any agricultural links. The farmers in the Longforgan and Invergowrie area do not go to the Forfar mart. They go to the Perth mart. I hope that that will be borne in mind when the Committee votes on those matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not always see eye to eye with the hon. Member for Tayside, North, as he knows. However, I agree with his opening comments and his insight into matters in Perthshire. I take a similar approach to that section of the boundary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The points raised by the hon. Member for Dundee, East about Monifieth high school are valid, but they are dealt with by amendments to later parts of the Bill. He makes it sound as though Angus does not offer services. That is far from the truth. Low rates and high-quality services, the lowest rents in Scotland and high-quality housing, are very attractive to the people of Monifieth. My stance is not anti-Dundee. I wish to see the town continue to thrive and prosper and offer its people a share in that prosperity in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendments are intended to support a positive view in respect of the citizens of Monifieth and to iron out Perthshire anomalies. They are an attempt to tidy up the borders of Angus district and its neighbours. They have the support of the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir N. Fairbairn), whose constituency will also be affected by the changes if they are accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposals would create a Perthshire island and attach it to Angus—something that would run counter to the wise argument of the hon. Member for Tayside, North. They would create an anomaly. Those areas have historical links not with Angus, but with Perthshire, towards which they are also oriented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to tidy up the anomalies between local government and parliamentary boundaries where Angus meets Perth and Kinross and Dundee. The Government's proposals to return Monifieth to Angus ensure that parliamentary and local government boundaries will eventually be aligned. My amendments would perform the same function for the other side of Dundee and so,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0122">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>209</span>
logically, should be acceptable to the Government if they are taking a consistent approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the reason for altering local government boundaries is not to align them with parliamentary constituencies, but to ensure the most efficient and effective delivery of services to local people?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly agree with the hon. Gentleman, but I am trying to make both coincide. The present proposals will push the boundary of Angus to within about 16 miles of the city of Perth. There is no historical precedent for that. If that came to pass, I should welcome those wards into Angus, but their geography and natural orientation point them towards Perthshire. It is on those practical and sensible grounds that I am proposing my relatively small alterations, which I hope the Government will accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would ensure that the areas of Birkhill, Auchterhouse, Strathmartine, Tealing, Emmock, Merroes and Wellbank—which I have represented on and off for the past 20 years—would go back into Angus where they belong. It is clear from local surveys that the majority of the population of Monifieth would prefer to be in Angus. Such a move would simply restore the town's historical connection with the county of Angus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The view from Monifieth is different from that outlined by the hon. Member for Dundee, East. That genuine difference of perspective is at the heart of the matter. It is also at the heart of the wish of the people of Monifieth to regain control over their own local government services and decision making. Before 1974, Monifieth had a proud history as an independent borough within Angus; what is new for its people is being in Dundee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seems to be saying that, by becoming part of Angus and Mearns, the people of Monifieth would regain their independence. Of course they would not. They would become a small part of Angus and Mearns, just as they are a small part of Dundee, and would be swamped by the votes elsewhere in that region. Before becoming part of Dundee, Monifieth was an independent borough. However, that is not an option now. The question is to which of the two large councils should it belong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a difference of perspective. The hon. Gentleman does not understand the viewpoint of the citizens of Monifieth. Being a borough within Angus will give it equality with other boroughs there. Being lost within the city of Dundee is exactly what the citizens of Monifieth, who have a distinct identity, do not want. The hon. Gentleman is looking with city eyes at a borough that was an historical part of Angus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people in Monifieth greatly regret the loss of borough status and their control over local decision making. Since 1974, Monifieth has been absorbed in the amorphous mass of Dundee city. However, with the restoration of its long-standing ties with Angus, the town will again reveal its identity as an Angus borough. It was never just a Dundee suburb and will again become an entity in its own right, on an equal basis with the other towns of Angus from which it will receive equal treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Monifieth regards itself as the forgotten town of Dundee district council. The strong local identity remains, despite
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>210</span>
a substantial increase in population. Although it undoubtedly has and will continue to have a close connection with Dundee, it has its own identity. Monifieth people will continue to contribute to the future prosperity of Dundee in providing goods and services and creating employment in the city. That will not change. The hon. Member for Dundee, East said that if Monifieth regained its former status that would mean a revenue loss for Dundee. That statement rather gives the game away. The hon. Gentleman has a cheek in averring that Angus district looks on Monifieth as a milch cow, considering that that is Dundee's view. In fact, Angus district will have to spend a great deal of money making good the deficiencies of the past 20 years, so that is hardly the attitude with which Angus views Monifieth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Monifieth should not be regarded as a mere money provider for Dundee. It deserves better treatment than that. It deserves value for money in its local government services. Restored within Angus, Monifieth could look forward to paying the lowest rates in Tayside, as opposed to the highest. It would also benefit from having the lowest rents in Scotland—at present, its rents are the highest in Tayside. In both cases, Monifieth could look forward to very high quality local government services spread fairly throughout the boroughs of Angus. As an equal borough in Angus, Monifieth can share the services that all the other boroughs enjoy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When Monifieth citizens look at the leisure services and the lower rates, allied to quality services provided throughout the towns of Angus, they can only contrast those facilities with the provision made in their 20 years with Dundee. Who can blame them for making such comparisons? There is no Monifieth community centre, in spite of the promises made. There are no sports facilities in Monifieth although the provision elsewhere in Dundee is good. There is not even a housing department in the borough, in spite of the high rents. While beach erosion went unchecked in Monifieth, in Carnoustie, only 16 miles up the coast, Angus district council spent more than £1 million on necessary beach and coastal defences projects, even though it is not the statutory authority involved. That did not go unnoticed in Monifieth. Local protest at the closure of Monifieth library led to a spontaneous sit-in, which showed that the loss of local decision-making powers is acutely felt in the borough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The return of Monifieth to Angus district will sort out a local government parliamentary boundary anomaly. It will be generally welcomed in the town, which can look forward to recognition of its status as it returns to being a borough of Angus. It can also look forward to the high standard of local government services which are enjoyed by the rest of the people of Angus.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A survey of 2,000 people was conducted throughout the borough. It was ironic that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, if the hon. Gentleman did not hear his hon. Friend's speech, he must be deaf. The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did indeed speak against the amendment, and so convincing was my speech that the hon. Gentleman then withdrew it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hardly think that the hon. Gentleman's speech was that convincing. I withdrew the amendment on the understanding that the Government would return with suitable proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point is that the people of Monifieth should have been consulted in a referendum. The survey's results were conclusive: the majority of people asked wished to be part of Angus. Again, I invite the hon. Member for Paisley, South (Mr. McMaster) to come to Monifieth and enjoy himself. In that way, he can see the benefits for himself and talk to the good people of Monifieth about these matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that I have done that. Between 1977 and 1978, I stayed very near to Monifieth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on his excellent taste.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Gentleman congratulated the hon. Member for Paisley, South on his excellent taste, was that for going to or leaving Monifieth?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For going to Monifieth. The hon. Gentleman should do the same. Unfortunately, Monifieth does not have a senior football team, but he is welcome to visit the other boroughs in Angus where we hope to entertain Ayr United and soundly defeat them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The view from Monifieth is very different from the view from the city of Dundee. A fundamental point is at stake. The borough of Monifieth ceased to exist in 1974 after the previous local government reform, but, at heart, it remains a small Angus borough, with which the local people indentify. They regret the loss of its decision-making powers, its absorption into a large city and the consequences of that. They want to join an Angus district council, which will take them back to their historical roots and make Monifieth an equal borough with the other boroughs in Angus. I support that desire of the people of Monifieth, I hope that the Government will do so, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make a fleeting contribution. I do not hold a fixed view. I listened carefully to the powerful case made by the hon. Member for Dundee, East to support the amendment. I am sceptical about the position of Monifieth, however, because the hon. Member for Angus, East also has a powerful case. It is difficult to balance the two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was struck by the problems caused when money follows population and by the effects that that has on local
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>212</span>
government. I hope that the Minister will deal with that valid point because it is not unique to this case. If the rate support grant formula, which is based on the client group approach, reflects the size of population and there is a 10 per cent. fall in expenditure, that is a significant factor. There could be conflict between two regions competing for money irrespective of the other merits of the argument. Central Government should tell the Committee their opinion on that to help me to make up my mind on this and other amendments. Is there any way of ameliorating the financial consequences so that decisions on finance would not just be based on the fact that money follows population?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remain to be convinced about the arguments on Monifieth. The hon. Member for Dundee, East made a convincing case about some of the other minor areas of the city. Perhaps, the Government will consider them sympathetically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting, useful and well-informed discussion about the boundaries around Dundee. As with so many issues relating to boundaries, some arguments do not point in the same direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Dundee, East for his kind comments about my meeting with his hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West and the delegation from Dundee district council. The delegation put forward a reasoned and well-argued case. I pay tribute, as those hon. Members did, to the work that the district council has done on the Dundee partnership between the public and private sectors, which has developed to further the common interests of the city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise the need for authorities to have available to them sufficient land to meet future requirements for economic and other development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The counterbalance to those arguments is local opinion and that case was put with reasoned fervour by the hon. Member for Angus, East. In reaching our decision not to include the Sidlaw and Monifieth electoral divisions within Dundee, we paid close attention to expressions of interest made during the consultations. We were particularly influenced by letters from a number of community councils—including Monifieth—which favoured being part of a rural authority, as opposed to a city authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Angus, East referred to a fairly extensive survey that was carried out in Monifieth. It seems clear mat such areas still have a close affinity with the former counties of Angus and Perthshire and Kinross. It is evident that they have never felt comfortable with the 1975 solution which took them into the city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate is not particularly partisan, but I must tell the hon. Member for Dundee, East that I have checked the voting records for when the matter was considered during the passage of the Bill that brought about the previous reorganisation. His right hon. and learned Friend the Leader of the Opposition voted against the inclusion of Monifieth in the city of Dundee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister understands that this is not the first occasion on which I have differed from my right hon. and learned Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept that. The Leader of the Opposition will accept it as well. Within the ranks of the Labour party, opinion is not necessarily unanimous about the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we are concerned with ranks and people not being united, how is it that every member of the Committee has received from councillor John Maxwell and his independent councillor colleagues a letter from the Stuartry of Kirkcudbright that bitterly complains about the Bill? I have checked it with John Howie, the chief executive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. My knowledge of Scotland is good enough to inform me that Kirkcudbright is not in Tayside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) has taken a close interest in the debate and made a point about local public opinion. I can assure him that a Tayside regional councillor, Dr. Dick Spiers of the Liberal Democrats, was quoted in the 12 October 1993 edition of the Dundee 	<i>Courier and Advertiser,</i> which stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"he accepted that people in areas like Monifieth wished to be in Angus".</p></blockquote>
Not just local councillors have argued that case. There has been a strong expression of public opinion in favour of Monifieth moving into the proposed Angus authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire asked about the effects of such changes on the revenue base. Grant-aided expenditure assessments will be constructed for each of the new councils and based on the factors that are currently considered by the distribution committee, such as needs, client groups and length of roads. They will be discussed with COSLA and all relevant factors will be taken into account when determining grants for the new councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was an attempt at a helpful answer, but it did not tell me anything that I do not already know. If there were big changes in the revenue available to some of the new authorities, would transitional arrangements or systems be put in place to try to mitigate some of the financial effects, which could be dramatic?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because of the importance of the needs element in grant, the severe consequences to which the hon. Gentleman refers will not arise in practice. I assure him that we shall have detailed discussions with COSLA about the grant mechanism for the new councils during and after transition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I accept that some of the points made by the hon. Member for Dundee, East have validity, I am convinced by the case made by the hon. Member for Angus, East and supported by my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North for keeping Monifieth in Angus, as the Bill proposes. Perhaps there is a parallel between Monifieth and Musselburgh, which is just outside Edinburgh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>214</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was talking about Edinburgh. Musselburgh is a historic royal burgh outside the city of Edinburgh. There was a considerable campaign to keep it outside Edinburgh under the terms of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to hear that the Minister takes account of public campaigns in Musselburgh. I hope that that is an encouraging sign of things to come as we proceed through the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, I am glad that the hon. Gentleman is encouraged. We are making reasonable progress and later today we may even reach that part of our proceedings of particular interest to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note that the hon. Member for East Lothian accepted the comparison between Musselburgh and Edinburgh and Monifieth and Dundee. Does my hon. Friend the Minister assume that the logical conclusion to be reached from that is that the hon. Member for East Lothian will support the application of that principle to Monifieth when the amendment is voted on?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to dictate to the hon. Member for East Lothian how he should vote in response to the case put by his hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East and the hon. Member for Angus, East. Perhaps the hon. Member for East Lothian was simply flagging up his particular interest in Musselburgh, a subject that we shall discuss before long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East spoke of the size of the city. We have made changes from the White Paper, because we received a number of representations relating to Camperdown Park and the West Pitkerro industrial estate. We recognised the importance of those areas to the city and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced to the House last November that they would be included in the new Dundee authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Angus, East and my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North are different from the amendment of the hon. Member for Dundee, East in relation to Monifieth. The intention behind both sets of amendments is that the Dundee boundary, as proposed in the Bill, would be retained on that side of the city, but the Sidlaw electoral division would be divided Angus and Mearns—Angus as it would be called—and Perthsire and Kinross in a way that would more closely reflect the allegiance of individual communities to the former counties. I think that both hon. Members said that that was the intention behind their amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The actual fine would be slightly different in each case. The proposals of the hon. Member for Angus, East have been carefully examined. His amendments are defective because a piece of the jigsaw seems to be missing. I am not criticising the hon. Gentleman, because I recognise that hon. Members who table amendments do not have the technical resources of the civil service behind them. The amendments would transfer some polling districts from Angus and Mearns to Dundee and others both to Dundee and Perth and Kinross simultaneously. I assume that their intention is to reflect former county allegiances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments of my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North are in a different category. They would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0125">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>215</span>
transfer polling district PDB—Longforgan—to Perthshire and Kinross.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, the amendments of the hon. Member for Angus, East do not meet his objectives, so I cannot accept them. I have listened carefully, however, to the case for Longforgan made clearly and reasonably by the hon. Gentleman and by my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North. The adjustment relating to Longforgan is minor and I accept the amendments of my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Minister's comments about my amendments being defective. Is he prepared to consider further representations and think again about them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am prepared to consider—without commitment and in a neutral way—possible amendments that the hon. Gentleman may table for discussion on the areas covered by his current amendments, which I cannot accept at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 20 and 29 undoubtedly raise some important issues, which the hon. Member for Dundee, East has put to the Committee. As I have said, for the reasons that I have given and that the hon. Member for Angus, East has outlined, I cannot accept the amendments on Monifieth and Invergowrie. That said, I have noted carefully the detailed arguments about the rest of the boundary around the north of the city. I want to consider further those details and, if appropriate, bring forward an amendments at a later stage based upon part of the boundary described in amendment No. 20. I say that positively. I expect to bring forward amendments that would reflect the case made by the hon. Member for Dundee, East. On that basis, I cannot accept the amendments before the Committee other than amendments Nos. 64, 65 and 66, in relation to Longforgan. I thank hon. Members for contributing to a reasoned debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask a question that is put better in a short, succinct speech than in an interruption. I have listened to the debate and it would be impertinent of me to get involved in the details of the places that have been discussed, but has the Scottish Office visited the people in the areas involved to discuss those matters? I was told bitterly by Richard Blackburn of Banff that no one from the Scottish Office has ever been to see the local people about the matters that we were discussing in our sitting on Thursday evening. The Wheatley commission went up and down the land to consult people. What have officials done about asking people in Perthshire, Dundee, Monifieth or Banff what they think? That is a straightforward question. What groundwork has been done? I look forward to hearing what the note that Mr. Batho is passing to the Minister says. I should like a direct answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Batho is not passing me a note. I can assure the hon.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I hope to show, there is no real logical ground—whether economic, social or based on reasons of transport, housing or employment—for the proposed change. The only reason that I can think of is the nature of the Argyll and Bute parlimentary seat, which, in recent memory, has been held by the Conservative party, the Scottish National party and now by the Liberals. I suspect that the change is a deliberate effort to move into the area a group of people who, it is thought, will prove to be natural Conservative voters, making for a more secure parliamentary seat following a future reorganisation of boundaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I hope to show later, there is no justifiable objective ground on which the change can be made. Much has been made by the Government of their claim that the reason for reorganisation is to bring local government closer to the people. I find it difficult to see how transferring Helensburgh, which is some nine miles away from Dumbarton, to Argyll, whose centre, Lochgilphead, is 65 miles away, can be deemed to bring local government closer to the people. Transferring an area from nine miles away from headquarters to 65 miles away from it does not by any stretch of the imagination bring it closer to the people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a judicial and political "boundary" between Dumbarton and Argyll and Bute districts since around the 12th century. This is a well documented fact. Helensburgh has never been part of the Argyll and Bute set-up and indeed has always formed part of the Earldom Of Lennox. The town of Helensburgh grew out of the hamlet of Mulig around 1776—not a lot of people know that—and was developed by the Dumbartonshire landowners, the Colquhouns. The town developed, in the main, due to Glasgow traders and industrialists setting up a second home on the banks of the River Clyde. The town, therefore, has no natural affinity with Argyll and Bute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practical terms the geography does not lend itself well to Helensburgh and the surrounding areas joining with Argyll and Bute. There is a round trip of some 130 miles between the towns of Helensburgh and Lochgilphead. The road between these two centres is often dangerous and the treacherous Rest and Be Thankful mountain pass has also to be negotiated. In winter that pass becomes hazardous and it is only thanks to Strathclyde regional council, that appropriate resources are made available to keep it open. Will the new Argyll and Bute district be able to divert resources in this manner?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>218</span>
There is very little trade or commuting between the two centres with virtually all business and commuting being between Helensburgh and Dumbarton, Helensburgh and Clydebank or Helensburgh and Glasgow. One of the principles used by the Government in their consultation exercise was that account must be taken of the geographical and physical aspects of the new authorities. That would not be the case if Helensburgh was to be incorporated in a new Argyll and Bute district.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The employment characteristics of Helensburgh are markedly different from those of Argyll and Bute. In the town of Helensburgh the most prominent categories of employment excluding Military Personnel tend to be employers and managers in large or small establishments. Those employment categories, and particularly employers and managers in large establishments, tend to be indicative of urban industries. Figures show that 10.1 per cent. of workers in Helensburgh are employees or managers in large establishments which suggests a work force who commutes from the town to the Vale of Leven or even beyond to Glasgow. It is extremely unlikely that any significant commuting takes place into Argyll and Bute, as few large establishments are located in that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also worth noting that the statistics show a very insignificant level of rural employment in Helensburgh, and, indeed, in all the wards suggested for inclusion in Argyll and Bute District. While it is true that some agricultural workers are resident in the area the numbers are small. The figures show quite clearly that the employment characteristics of Argyll and Bute are much more agriculturally oriented. Helensburgh and Argyll and Bute therefore have completely different employment bases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Local Enterprise Council said in its report:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Helensburgh will face considerable difficulties over the next few years as the construction work at Faslane finally ends".</p></blockquote>
It discussed the difficulties that the area faces, which will require a considerable injection of money. It said that, in economic development terms, Helensburgh and the surrounding area are linked to Dumbarton and Glasgow, not to Argyll and the islands. The area is dependent on two activities: defence and tourism. In the case of tourism, the area will benefit considerably from the continuing work available at Dumbarton and Loch Lomond. Dumbartonshire Enterprise is the lead body in terms of defence restructuring and tourism. As substantial numbers of local residents are employed elsewhere in Dumbartonshire, it is logical for that area to remain not only with Dumbartonshire Enterprise but with the Dumbarton district council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On house purchase and movement between the two areas, there is very little house-buyer movement from Argyll and Bute to the western part of Dumbarton district as shown by the statistics recorded with the register of Scotland between 1 April 1993 and 31 August 1993. Transactions recorded in August 1993 are the most recent for which I have details. Of the 299 house purchases recorded in Helensburgh, only one was purchased by a person previously residing in Argyll and Bute. That is similar to the figure for those moving to Helensburgh from outside the United Kingdom. So far, no one has suggested linking Helensburgh with the rest of Europe in a local authority area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Movement between other parts of Dumbarton district and from Strathclyde region, excluding Argyll and Bute,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0127">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>219</span>
to Helensburgh is much more significant. It shows the reasonable level of movement of 38 transactions and 12 transactions respectively over the first eight months of 1993. It is clear that there is little population movement between Argyll and Helensburgh, but substantial movement between Helensburgh and the rest of Strathclyde and the Dumbarton area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are no traditional democratic links between the two areas that it is proposed should be brought together. It is difficult to see how accountability will be enhanced by the proposed linkage. It is debatable as to whether an organisation can be deemed to be accountable if a section of the population—those living in Helensburgh—are effectively excluded from the decision-making process. It may be argued that the people of Helensburgh will not be disadvantaged by the switch because a local office may be based there, but the centre of decision making will be regularly outwith the reach of the majority of the population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's document states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Accountability and responsiveness should mean that an ordinary citizen should feel more often than just at election time, that he or she has an opportunity to be heard and if necessary to gain redress".</p></blockquote>
It is difficult to see how that will be achieved if the centre from which the people of Helensburgh are governed is Lochgilphead. For example, if people want to examine a planning application at local authority headquarters, they will be obliged to travel 65 miles to Lochgilphead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Public transport links into Argyll and Bute are limited with only three bus services a day through Dumbarton district. It is significant that there are no direct public transport links from the Helensburgh area to Lochgilphead. If there were a requirement to make that journey, passengers would have to travel to Dumbarton by bus or train or by train to Arrochar or Glasgow to catch one of the three buses a day from those settlements to Lochgilphead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no rail link between the centres of population in Helensburgh and Lochgilphead. If a constituent wished to attend a meeting of the new council, he would have to travel to Dumbarton or Glasgow to get a connection to Oban. Then, a further journey by bus would be required. In those circumstances, it is difficult to see how the proposed change could in any way bring local government closer to the people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Strathclyde region disappears, it can be confidently predicted that the cost of rail travel to and from Helensburgh will double. For example, the cost of a trip to Glasgow will rise from £4.50 for a day return to £9. That will be due to the removal of the rail subsidy. This Bill is based on 1973 transport legislation, which does not include Helensburgh in the passenger transport executive. The people of Helensburgh are therefore not entitled to rail subsidies. Under the terms of the Bill, they are not entitled to the subsidies because Helensburgh is not in the original designated area, which spans 15 miles from the centre of Glasgow. We therefore expect rail fares to increase considerably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, there is no recognised bus service between Helensburgh and Lochgilphead. If any such service were established, it would require subsidies from the transport authority to make it viable to operators. If it did not require subsidy, it probably would have been snapped up by operators after the deregulation of bus routes.

Many of us have received substantial submissions from the Roman Catholic Church and individual Catholic constituents about the future of education. Whatever the eventual shape of local government, there are bound to be problems associated with the provision of education and in ensuring that the standards applied in each area are the same. The education system currently administered by the regional councils is of sufficient size to allow the provision of specialist services. It is highly unlikely that an Argyll and Bute district council of limited size could offer the wide range of services that are currently available in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to refer in particular to the provision of Catholic education in particular. There is no Catholic secondary school in the area. It would be extremely helpful if we could have a clear statement from the Minister about future arrangements. At present, children who live in the Helensburgh area and who wish to attend the Catholic secondary school, travel to Our Lady and St. Patrick's high school in Dumbarton. If Helensburgh is taken out of Dumbarton district, where will those children be educated?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is genuine anxiety among the Catholic population that, because the authority in Argyll will have surplus private and secondary places in the non-denominational sector, it will not be willing to pay for youngsters to travel to schools in another authority to receive Catholic secondary education. There are fears that the authority will oblige children to attend a non-denominational school or that, if a move is necessary, parents will be obliged to make the travel arrangements themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) and I have already had a meeting about this matter, and I know that he intends to give me a written response. However, it would be helpful if he placed on record the arrangements that will be made in future. I look forward to his clarification of the position, either now or later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Gentleman has finished his speech, I shall be delighted to say a few words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Finally, I see no reason why the town of Helensburgh and the surrounding area should be hived off to merge with Argyll and Bute district council. There are no historical ties; such a move would not reflect local loyalties and allegiances. No account has been taken of the area's geography or physical boundaries. No account has been taken of the travel-to-work patterns or of the transport and communications link. Indeed, no account has been taken of the practicalities of extracting Helensburgh from its historic home in the district of Dumbarton. In essence, this proposal is little more than a gerrymander to transfer people who are thought to vote Conservative to Argyll district in the hope that the parliamentary constituency will in future provide a safe home for the Conservative party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Davidson). He has invited me to respond briefly to his points, and I am glad to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that as a result of the new boundaries, some children in a school's catchment area will no longer be able to attend that school if, after reorganisation, it is in a different education authority from the authority covering their area. We shall, of course, debate this issue in more detail when we reach clause 32, but I am glad to have the opportunity this morning to correct at least some of the misleading statements which have been made over the past few months and which have generated much unnecessary worry among parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, let me make it absolutely clear that under existing legislation, pupils already attending a school when the reorganisation takes effect will be entitled to remain there until they have completed their schooling unless they are excluded for disciplinary reasons. Secondly, existing legislative provisions relating to educational provision, such as school transport and special educational needs, will remain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, as under present arrangements, an authority must consult on any proposals it has to change catchment areas and in certain cases—when, for example, a school is more than 80 per cent. full—such proposals must thereafter be referred to my right hon. Friend for decision. There are also certain further legislative safeguards for denominational education and denominational schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those provisions, added to new provisions, such as those for siblings, which we have proposed as part of the Bill, mean that changes in catchment areas—if they happen and where they occur—will be made as part of an ordered process with local people having the right to input their views as part of the consultation procedure. Any changes will not happen automatically. We shall debate the issues thoroughly in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way in a moment. I look forward to the debate on clause 32. I confirm that we shall listen carefully to all the points that are made and that we shall respond fully at the appropriate time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made an important statement which will have to be scrutinised carefully and discussed with those affected. However, will he clarify one thing? His second point was that school transport will be provided. In many areas, school transport is shared between those who go to other schools. If Catholic pupils, but not non-Catholic pupils, are to be transported, the extra per head costs to the local authority of transporting the Catholic pupils will be considerable. I suspect that in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>222</span>
some cases special taxis will be used. Has the Scottish Office considered those extra costs and, if so, what is the result of that consideration?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is anticipating the response that I shall receive to our many debates under caluse 32. I assure him that I shall consider carefully his points about costs and shall give him a full response. As a matter of courtesy, let me tell him that I sent him a letter this morning, a copy of which will be placed in the Library. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I shall soon meet Archbishop Winning of Glasgow to discuss those matters in more detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister has been courteous enough to write to me, that letter, and letters on other matters, should be circulated to all members of the Committee. Let me take this opportunity to thank the other Minister, the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), for his four-page letter. It would be good to circulate that letter so that it can be studied. On those sensitive issues, it would be better if such letters were the property of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall want to return to the Minister's important statement. We shall all want to study his statement in 	<i>Hansard</i> because there is much anxiety about the issue throughout the country. We are receiving many letters from people, and not just from parents, who are involved in Roman Catholic education in Scotland. The issue has yet to broaden out into education generally. Catchment areas will be important for all school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding the amendment, I support the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Govan. He made important and sensible arguments about why Helensburgh should be with Dumbarton. The central point relates to the transport links that Helensburgh enjoys with other parts of Scotland. The movement is from Helensburgh to Glasgow, to Dumbarton and to Clydebank. It is unlikely that there will be a great volume of movement to places such as Lochgilphead. Movement is likely to be to Paisley—perhaps I should declare an interest—and over the Erskine bridge, which is an important link between Renfrewshire and Dumbartonshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That being the case, the economy of Helensburgh is dependent on transport links and its relationship with Glasgow and other towns. If Helensburgh is located where the Government want, its people may feel in their guts that they are on to a good deal, but there will be practical problems. My hon. Friend the Member for Govan stressed that the people would be distant from decision-making. That could be important in many ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Decentralisation could handle the problem, but anyone with experience of it knows that there are always limits
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0129">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>223</span>
and constraints on how much power is shifted to and shared with people. Some decisions are always left to the higher level. For example, the decision to close a Helensburgh library may be taken in Lochgilphead. The practical problem would be that those who wanted to lobby the council would have a considerable distance to travel. Helensburgh's links and affinities are more likely to be with Clydebank and Dumbarton, which are far more accessible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Helensburgh's people may think that they are not getting a bad deal, but many of them are realising on closer examination that the advantages may be superficial. Perhaps the council tax would be lower, but paying for the upkeep of rural schools in the Argyll area that have few pupils and need teachers and specialist services will mean a significantly greater per capita cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the problem of concessionary fares. We are being told that any local authority can provide concessionary fares, but they are useful only if the people who want to take advantage of them can travel to the areas to which they want to go. If people in Helensburgh are likely to want to go to Glasgow, Clydebank, Dumbarton and Paisley, concessions will not be as useful because those towns may be outwith the local authority area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be problems with specialist services. A current case involves the provision of audiology services for deaf children in the Paisley area. I have had a helpful response from the Minister. Children from Paisley have to travel to Dumbarton to be provided with the services. Paisley and Dumbarton provide services for a wide area. If Helensburgh was part of the authority proposed in the Bill, it would be unlikely that the authority could sustain a significant level of audiology services. Arrangements could be made, but it has not been made clear what they would be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to discuss what the Minister said and question him, hopefully without making too hasty a judgment about his remarks. I shall study his comments carefully later. We have all been inundated with letters from people involved in Roman Catholic education. They have expressed genuine fears about what the Bill will do, not only to Roman Catholic education, but to education in general.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to an earlier question, the Minister said that he had not met representatives of the Roman Catholic Church to discuss education since mid September. I am delighted to hear that meetings are now going ahead. It is vital that Ministers meet representatives of the Church to hear what they have to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a few detailed questions for the Minister. He made a statement about the rights of existing pupils in Roman Catholic schools. What rights will new pupils have in those catchment areas? He also mentioned the provision of transport. That will not be seen as a solution by parents or teachers. If the whole system depends on transport being provided, there must be specific provision for its funding. In addition, we need to know whether the provision of transport will be a duty on local authorities or whether it is something that they may provide if they choose to do so. If it is only optional, that is kidology. It solves no problems at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>224</span>
The Minister concluded by saying that the problems that we had outlined would happen automatically. That might be the case, but that does not mean that the problems will not happen. In many cases, I am sure that they will. Therefore, we need detailed answers on how the problems will be solved. I know that we shall hear some of them later in our proceedings, but I hope that we will receive some answers today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Govan, which is important. Helensburgh is logically and historically associated with Clydebank and Dumbarton. My hon. Friend's concluding remarks were correct. If Ministers do not consider the issue seriously and sympathetically, people will regard their proposals as little more than gerrymandering.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I begin by commending the speech made by the hon. Member for Govan, which was good and serious as was that made by the hon. Member for Paisley, South. However, I would like to criticise them in one regard. Labour Members cannot get through a speech without mentioning the word gerrymandering. The hon. Member for Govan used it at the conclusion of his speech and so did the hon. Member for Paisley, South. I am beginning to believe that there is a new definition for the word: it is any proposal with which the Labour party does not agree. That is the underlying theme and that is sad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Govan suggested that the sole reason for including Helensburgh in Argyll and Bute was that the Conservative party has its eye on the Argyll and Bute seat. He came to that conclusion, but he opened his speech with a similar statement. That is strange. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) will correct me if I am wrong, but I understand that the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie) supports the proposal in the Bill. If that is so, it totally destroys the arguments of the hon. Member for Govan.

The Bill recognises people's choice and not political choice. That is why I am prepared to table, an appropriate amendment later and to support now the proposals in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not entirely certain whether the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a commendable view. I shall shortly discuss the views of the Argyll and Bute authority. I believe that the inclusion of Helensburgh in the area constitutes a recognition of the submissions received by the Secretary of State in the consultation process. That is commendable, as far as it goes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Secretary of State has taken into account such submissions in relation to Helensburgh, why has he not done so in relation to places such as Barrhead, Ralston and all the other places in Scotland? Is the practice exclusive to Helensburgh?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That remains to be seen. Many areas of Scotland will be the subject of debate in the next few sittings. Many representations will be considered and no doubt the Scottish Office and my hon. Friend the Minister will consider them. I suggest that the hon. Member for Paisley, South should think back to Tuesday night, when representations made by people from the north-east of Scotland were certainly given attention. That cuts the ground from under his feet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that the Labour party's consultation document on the future of local government states clearly that there can be no one solution for all parts of Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend, as always, made a valuable contribution. It is worth stressing that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not intend to intervene, but an oblique reference has been made to me, as I chaired the committee in relation to the proposal that has been mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will know it well, then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I do. It states that a consistent principle must apply in the drawing up of boundaries, and not a practice of drawing up boundaries first and looking for excuses later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Almost certainly, if I had to read the hon. Gentleman's document, I should find a consistent principle running through it. That is the principle of socialism which the hon. Gentleman totally embraces. I should be surprised if it were not present in the document. That ideal tends to suggest that everything should be the same. I suggest to the hon. Gentleman that that is the last thing we need in local government in Scotland. We need local government that can relate to each area in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Stop gerrymandering then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman keeps up a continual barrage from the Opposition Front Bench, in parrot fashion, saying, "Stop gerrymandering." We are not gerrymandering. We are listening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to a reasoned contribution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those Labour Members who are barracking should reflect on the debate earlier this morning. The hon. Member for Dundee, East made an excellent contribution to our deliberations and the Minister responded positively. The hon. Member for Angus, East also gave a reasoned and detailed explanation, as members with local knowledge do. The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>226</span>
Minister responded positively to the hon. Gentleman, too. I will not refer to my own contribution other than to say that I am delighted by the positive response that it received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is wrong to suggest that there is any form of gerrymandering. The Committee is an example of what should go on. I hope that we will continue as we have done in the first few days.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not feel that I have been constantly barracked. I accept that honest interventions have been made, and I would like to think that I have responded to them as I have seen things, albeit not always to the liking of Opposition Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that time is getting on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the record, the hon. Gentleman and his party could have freed themselves from all accusations of gerrymandering had they set up a commission. We do not criticise the Minister. Indeed, we are grateful for the excellent and positive way he treated the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East. We simply ask that he does it a bit more often.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman. Once again, that is typical of the ideas coming from the Opposition. They suggest that Governments should not govern, but should simply pass the buck to another body to get it to make decisions which can then be considered. Eventually the Government will decide to act upon them or have another commission to check on the effects of the first commission. Who knows?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that we need to take every issue of Government and pass it to other bodies. There has been much criticism of quangos and others from the Opposition. The Government have a job to govern and to decide. That is what they are attempting to do with the Bill. It is an excellent Bill. It needs some changes and I shall deal with one of those in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Argyll and Bute district council is very happy with the proposals as they stand. It is happy to accept Helensburgh. Some enthusiasm is being expressed by the members of Argyll and Bute district council. That is not a Tory run council; of 26 members of its members, four are Conservatives and the provost is a member of the Labour party. Well done Argyll and Bute. It has seen what they want. It has listened to the people living on its edges and has accepted their strong arguments. That was wise and reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Argyll and Bute district council has expressed happiness about the possibility of my amendment on Luss being accepted. It does not have a view either way. It will accept the decision of the Committee, but it would be pleased to accept the citizens of Luss into its area of authority and control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to return to the debate on Helensburgh and the Secretary of State's consultation paper. He has sought views and is prepared to look at them. I have an article from the 	<i>Helensburgh Advertiser</i> of December 1992. It contrasted the local government reorganisation in 1992 with that in 1975 under the headline
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0131">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>227</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"In 1975 you had NO choice—In 1992 you HAVE".</p></blockquote>
On that basis, it carried out its own survey of opinion within the Helensburgh area. Six questions were asked referring to the future local government of Helensburgh. There was a response of 1,200 from an electors' list of 10,000 people. That equates to 1,200 responses from 4,000 homes in the Helensburgh area; 30 per cent. of homes responded. That is a remarkable exercise of consultation with people and a democratic exercise that illustrates a point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have two points to make. First, experience of canvassing has taught me, and no doubt the hon. Gentleman, that not everyone in a house will vote the same way as the person on the doorstep. Obtaining a response from a certain number of people does not mean that the number of people in a number of houses can be added together and then multiplied to come up with a figure of 30 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, does the hon. Gentleman agree that the only political party that was involved in encouraging a response to the referendum was the Conservative party? That skewed the result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that individuals in every home do not always go along with each other's views, but I was careful to discuss the figure of 30 per cent. of homes, not 30 per cent. of the electorate. As the hon. Gentleman rightly said, some families may have responded, but there equally could have been people who would have liked to have responded but did not have access to the paper or to the form and could not submit a reply. The hon. Gentleman made a 50:50 argument that does not detract from the excellent democratic process carried out by the 	<i>Helensburgh Advertiser.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only the Conservative party pushed the referendum: community councils also pushed it. Community councils are supposed to establish and register local opinion. That was a major force behind the survey and the success of it is represented in the figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Honourable Members should analyse the results. They show that a staggering 96 per cent. of people in the area wanted to step aside from Dumbarton and Clydebank. That represents the strength of feeling in the area about the Secretary of State's proposals as they stand. More than half of the responses took joining Helensburgh with Argyll as first choice. There was a strong, but minority lobby that favoured Helensburgh being by itself, but virtually across the board, the decision was for amalgamation with Argyll.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to discuss comments made by people who, as far as I am aware, have non-political links, but are from the community. The 	<i>Helensburgh Advertiser</i> carried the headline:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Rural Residents Say 'No'</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>To Dumbarton District".</p></blockquote>
That is a sound endorsement. The paper also stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>" 'A clear majority was in favour of going in with Argyll with an alternative of Helensburgh itself,' said Dr. Bill McKenna, Community Council chairman.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'This seems to be in line with most community councils in the area who prefer Argyll'."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>228</span>
That is very telling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Comment was also passed by Councillor Petrie, who is an independent and a former provost of Dumbarton. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>" 'I am appealing on the basis of my 23 years as an elected councillor in this area,' he said this week, 'and it has been made clear to me that the majority of people in the Helensburgh area want to be united with Argyll or at least be rid of Dumbarton District Council.'"</p></blockquote>
Who was he appealing to? He was appealing to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland who recognised the merits of the appeal and acted accordingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 16 July 1993 the 	<i>Helensburgh Advertiser</i> stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The majority of people were celebrating this week following the announcement that Helensburgh and District will be united under the new authority of Argyll and Bute.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The general consensus appears to be relief that Helensburgh has finally been torn away from the unwelcome grasp of Dumbarton District Council."</p></blockquote>
That argument has been going on in Helensburgh since the previous local Government reorganisation. At last a Secretary of State for Scotland has responded to the will of the people. It is shameful that Opposition Members try to detract from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Govan referred to employment characteristics. Helensburgh certainly has a commuter relationship with Glasgow, but nobody would suggest that, on that basis, it should be amalgamated with Glasgow city authority. The same argument could be made regarding Dumbarton. That detracts from the hon. Gentleman's case. He also mentioned defence and tourism. People in Argyll and Bute are particularly concerned about tourism and, in future, Helensburgh will benefit from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman had the audacity to refer to defence. I understand that for years Dumbarton district council wanted to be a nuclear-free zone. Here is its chance. Once again, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland has realised a wish of Dumbarton district council: he is going to put the nuclear zone in Argyll.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also spoke about the passenger transport executive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must say to my hon. Friend the Minister, who has been very supportive in the past few minutes, that we must examine that issue. When he winds up, I hope that he will comment on the idea of maintaining the status quo but adding on the small area of Luss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I identify with some of the remarks of the hon. Members for Govan and for Paisley, South on education. I welcome what my hon. Friend the Minister, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton), said this morning. I recognise that certain implications must be considered, particularly regarding Catholic education. I think that the words of my hon. Friend the Minister did alienate in part some misgivings, but during future debates we shall look to my hon. Friend for more words on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend meant reassure, not alienate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>229</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I used the word "alienate", I was wrong; I meant to say reassure. There is, perhaps, more room for debate on the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has touched on an important aspect of the question of boundaries and local government. The visit of Archbishop Winning and of others alerted all members of the Committee to the importance and well-being of the Catholic education system in Scotland. No member of the Committee would be unimpressed by the case that was made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following a question from the hon. Member for Linlithgow the other day, I advised him that I was about to meet Archbishop Winning. If hon. Members were to put to me the same question today, I should reply that I am due to meet him today. He has a serious point to make and we must respond to him positively. His concerns are genuine and must be dealt with.

Amendment No. 69 would make an adjustment to the local authority area of Luss, which is a small community council area that borders on Helensburgh. It has about 14 miles of common boundary with Argyll. The people of Luss regard Helensburgh as a place for shopping and social recreation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be slightly more courteous than he was last week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. He mentions Luss. What consultations did he have with the hon. Member whose constituency includes Luss before tabling the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I advised the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) who represents Luss that I would be tabling the amendment. I also advised the hon. Gentleman that I have been in touch with the community councillors in Luss, the residents, and councillors from the surrounding areas. The hon. Member for Dumbarton, along with everyone else I advised, had the right to speak to me about this matter at any time. I am well aware of his opinions. I know that he would have supported the amendment of the hon. Member for Govan, and that he would have opposed mine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley seems to be saying that members of a Committee should not table amendments for debate by the Committee if their aims run contrary to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>230</span>
those of the hon. Member who represents the constituency affected. That is absolute nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that there should be certain courtesies and reasonable cross-party relationships in this place. Hon. Members should not harangue those from other parties simply because they belong to different parties.

I emphasise that I had contact with the hon. Member for Dumbarton, who was clear about my intentions. I do not see the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will give way to the senior Opposition Member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his discussions with councillors in the areas surrounding Luss, did the hon. Gentleman mention the problem of the proposed Loch Lomond national park? It raises serious questions regarding Luss's relations with the areas to the east and around Loch Lomond.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for making a fair point. I raised the matter with those from Argyll and Bute district councils who, I understand, also have an interest in the matter. So that is not a matter of concern as far as this issue is concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman allow me to clarify that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not. It is coming up to 1 o'clock.

I have already mentioned some of the links that Luss has with Helensburgh. In addition to shopping and recreation, Luss also has links with the Church. It has its own parish and the church in Arrochar is part of the new Argyll and Bute proposal.
