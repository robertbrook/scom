	<p>[MR. NORMAN HOGG 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='legislation'>The Economy in Scotland</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I have been checking the records and I notice that, although there are 49 Labour Members, hon. Members from the official Opposition are seldon called to speak in sittings of the Scottish Grand Committee, whereas hon. Members from the minority party—one is here today and another is notably absent—are called far more often than is justified by their number. I am afraid that your well-known affection for the Scottish National party is showing through, Mr. Hogg. You seem to be calling those nationalists again and again and again. What is going on between you and the Scottish National party? This love affair must stop.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no love affair between myself and the Scottish National party. I noticed a letter in the 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> this morning, which accused me of blasphemy—and me, an elder of the kirk. That was a terrible thing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.31 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Lang)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the matter of the economy in Scotland.</p></blockquote>
As we approach the end of the year, I think that it is an appropriate time to debate the Scottish economy. I welcome the opportunity to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish economy is inextricably linked to that of the United Kingdom as a whole. It does, of course, have some important distinctive features, to which I shall allude later. But essentially, the health of the Scottish economy depends on the health of the United Kingdom economy as a whole, of which it forms a part. That must be the basic starting-point to any discussion on the Scottish economy and its prospects for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Judged by that criterion, there is indeed cause for confidence. The United Kingdom economy has climbed strongly out of recession. Gross domestic product has risen for six consecutive quarters—a year and a half since we turned the corner from the bottom of the recession. The latest Treasury forecast is for higher-than-expected growth in the current year and for accelerated growth in 1994. In parallel with those forecasts, independent forecasters also predict continued GDP growth for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The strong performance of the economy has been due, in no small part, to the Government's success in controlling inflation. Retail price inflation has been below 2 per cent. for most of the past year, something that has not happened for over 30 years. Successful control of inflation has also enabled the Government to cut interest rates by no less than 9 percentage points over the past three years, and, at 5.5 per cent., these are now the lowest in the European Union.
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Recent gains in productivity have been impressive, especially in the manufacturing sector, and have considerably strengthened our competitive challenge in domestic and overseas markets.

It is in the overseas market that the benefits to Scotland, in particular, have been most apparent. Let me refer the Committee to the survey of manufactured exports in 1992–93 published earlier this month by the Scottish Council (Development and Industry). This showed that Scotland's share of UK manufactured exports rose to an all-time high of 10.1 per cent. in 1992 and that Scottish manufacturing exports per employee were no less than 24 per cent. above the corresponding figure for the United Kingdom. In particular sectors, exports of office machinery and data processing equipment were up by over 14 per cent.; of paper and printing and publishing by 13 per cent.; of rubber and plastics by nearly 11 per cent.; of mechanical engineering by 10 per cent.; and of food and drink-predominantly, of course, whisky—by nearly 8 per cent. I could go on, but the message is clear enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Jeremy Bray 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Motherwell, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although those figures sound encouraging, will the Secretary of State comment on the recent report of the Scottish Electronics Forum which shows the vulnerability of electronics—our fastest-growing industry? The report states that a possible reduction of 30 per cent. in employment in that industry may occur in the next few years because electronics lacks a basis in research and development, world marketing and product responsibility. Will the Secretary of State publish that report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The publication of the report is a matter for Scottish Enterprise, which commissioned it. The hon. Gentleman referred to the MONITOR report, which draws attention to the electronics industry's strengths—of which there are many, as the hon. Gentleman will acknowledge—as well as potential weaknesses, which will occur unless the industry reacts to changing world circumstances. The Scottish Electronics Forum has been established to achieve such a reaction and to ensure that the industry remains competitive. I was pleased to participate in the recent launch of the forum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to research and development. I agree that that is important for the electronics industry. However, it is significant that 47 per cent. of all inward investor electronics companies include some element of research and development in their activities in this country. We are helping such companies to tune in to the strengths in our academic institutions. Therefore, great potential exists for the industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Clarke 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Midlothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State will know that Ferranti International has experienced difficulties. In a factory in Dalkeith, which is in my constitutency, half the work force has been paid off. Ferranti led and formed the backbone of the electronics industry for many years. Has the Scottish Office inquired about helping the receiver at the factory to surmount the problems? There are difficulties and hiccups in the electronics industry. The story is not all glory. A severe hiccup has occurred at that factory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, all hon. Members acknowledge the difficulties that Ferranti has experienced in recent years. Those difficulties are caused not only by the competitiveness of the sphere of its activity, but also by the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0009">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
specific circumstances of the company and its management in recent years. If the Scottish Office Industry Department can be of assistance, we are ready to help. I understand the anxiety of the hon. Member for Midlothian (Mr. Clarke) about the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The picture that I present to the Committee includes more than the electronics industry. The picture is of success across a broad and increasingly diversified range of export activity. At a time of very difficult trading conditions in the world economy, particularly in Europe, that is a remarkable achievement by Scottish companies-employers and employees alike—and I offer them my warmest congratulations. Their performance shows graphically what can be achieved when Governments create a stable and fundamentally strong economic base that leaves business free to seek out market opportunities, to take risks, and to create both wealth and employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday, Mr. Hogg, you and I had the opportunity to attend an important trade fair in Glasgow—Europartenariat. There, 1,500 small businesses from European countries, including nearly 350 Scottish businesses, met for two days in Glasgow to help to develop the relationship between the Scottish economy and European economies. Huge potential exists for the future growth of business and for revenue to Scottish companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not claim that export performance sums up the strength of an economy. I accept, too, that some of Scotland's key export markets in Europe are at present going through a difficult phase and that the recovery in demand in countries such as Italy and Germany might occur only at a modest rate next year. They have not yet steered through the world recession with the same success as we have. But I do believe that our strength in exports is a clear indicator of the underlying strength of the economy. Indeed, we should not forget that Scotland entered the recent recession in a relatively strong position. The Scottish economy grew by more than 12 per cent. during the three years to 1990. That is faster than the average growth in Europe and faster than growth in the United States.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Secretary of State lives in Monkton, he will know that one of the largest Scottish exporters in the past has been Jetstream. It now experiences problems because of the downturn in the aviation industry. There are ways in which the Government could help to create a level playing field with support for the aircraft industry, greater help from the Export Credits Guarantee Department and orders from the Ministry of Defence. Those matters were raised yesterday by the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) and other hon. Members, but the response of the Minister for Industry was negative and complacent. Will the Secretary of State for Scotland, who is a member of the Cabinet and more powerful than the Minister for Industry, be more encouraging today and say that some action will be taken to help Jetstream? Otherwise, the 630 job losses that have been announced will escalate and the future of the plant will be under threat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand and share the hon. Gentleman's anxiety about the problems that British Aerospace is facing with Jetstream. I met the management of British Aerospace recently to discuss the problems. We must recognise that the market in which it is competing—11 or so manufacturers worldwide are competing for very few orders—creates circumstances that no Government can control. The Government have made to British Aerospace
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
the largest single regional selective assistance offer ever made to any company. That should help to accommodate it in Prestwick and to create the sort of expansion there that the quality of its product justifies.

During the 1980s, the Scottish economy grew by an average of 2·4 per cent. a year, contrasting with less than 1 per cent. a year between 1974 and 1979. Manufacturing productivity in Scotland—an important criterion for measuring the success of an economy—rose during the 1980s by 5·4 per cent. a year, as against only 2 per cent. during the 1970s. In the electronics industry alone productivity rose at an average rate of 11·6 per cent. per annum during the 1980s and during the same period the output of the electronics industry increased more than fourfold. Such figures illustrate the progress of the Scottish economy in recent years and go a long way to explain its stronger performance in the recent recession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) asked for evidence, so I shall provide some. Recent survey evidence is consistent with my view. The latest Scottish Chamber of Commerce survey reported that business confidence and demand had risen in all the main sectors of the Scottish economy and that investment intentions were being revised upwards in manufacturing, retailing and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0010">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
wholesaling. Similar findings for manufacturing were reported in the October CBI survey on industrial trends. 	<i>The Scotsman</i> on 27th October under the headline.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Scots industry leaving rest of Britain behind"</p></blockquote>
stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'Scotland is outperforming the rest of Britain on virtually every front', the Confederation of British Industry reported yesterday.</p></blockquote>
Publishing the best set of economic figures for 18 months, John Ward, the chairman of CBI Scotland, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There are more pluses than we have seen before—pluses across the board.' Business confidence among manufacturers has risen, reflecting improved demand and output. Employment has increased and investment intentions have strengthened. 'We're seeing growth in the domestic markets as well as exports.'"</p></blockquote>
The report goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"One surprise was the finding that employment in Scottish manufacturers had increased for the first time since January 1990. More than one third of companies, 35 per cent., had taken on more staff."</p></blockquote>
That is 	<i>The Scotsman's</i> report of the views of the CBI. The survey also noted a sharp fall in the number of firms working below full capacity and the strongest growth in investment intentions for over five years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even if the Secretary of State's reading of the press cuttings is taken at face value, what would he say to the Federation of Small Businesses, which has written to every Member of Parliament warning them of the terrible damage that will be caused to small businesses and to the chance of any further recovery by the Statutory Sick Pay Bill to be debated in the House?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the fact that small businesses are exempt from those provisions. I draw his attention also to the package for the small business sector announced in the Budget, which affects the VAT threshold, audit arrangements and provisions for the prompt payment of debt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, of course, and will continue to be a strong Government commitment to the distinctive needs of the Scottish economy. That commitment was strongly expressed in my right hon. and learned Friend's recent Budget, which included a variety of good news announcements for Scotland. They included plans to upgrade the west coast main rail line, the establishment of a new Scottish air traffic control centre at Prestwick, the recognition of the importance of the Scotch whisky industry, a package of help for small businesses, as I have just described, and increased help for Scottish business ratepayers, amounting to £60 million, towards achieving convergence with England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Most recently, the Government's commitment to the Scottish economy was reflected in the public expenditure plans, which I announced to the House on 8 December. Those plans mean that, within responsible and sound overall plans for total UK public expenditure and for elimination of the public sector borrowing requirement over the next few years, the Scottish Office share is a good one, with a budget up over £500 million to more than £14 billion. In making allocations among individual programmes, I have used the flexibility available to me under the Scottish block to attune the allocations to Scottish needs and priorities. In particular, I have been able to give priority to programmes important for economic development, such as the industry programmes, including the enterprise networks, roads and transport. Where possible, I have given priority to capital expenditure. During the next three years, we shall spend nearly £2 billion on the industry programmes. That, will allow us to meet the expected demand for regional assistance, and to support the anticipated European Research and Development Fund grants following our success in negotiating an extension of Scottish coverage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The allocation I have announced will also enable Scottish Enterprise to take over the inward investment functions of the new town development corporations as they are wound up.

I was making the important point that for shipping services to Orkney and Shetland—I am glad to note that the hon.

In the Government's strategy for economic development, there are three main strengths on which we intend to build. The first is the impact of inward investment. Despite the difficulties caused by the recession, it is encouraging that so many overseas companies have continued to invest in Scotland. The past year was another outstanding one for Scotland's inward investment efforts. Notwithstanding the difficult environment worldwide, Scotland succeeded in attracting 65 projects—more than one a week—associated with more than 8,000 jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of our well-established inward investors such as Motorola, NEC, National Semiconductor and Sun Microsystems are now announcing second and even third-time investments. More recently, there have been new start-up by such companies as Solectron Corporation, VRG and Tandem Computers. We have also seen the first investment by a Singapore company in Scotland, with PCI creating 300 new jobs in its new European manufacturing and research and development headquarters at East Kilbride.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister responsible for Industry and I are delighted to have been able to take an active role working with Locate in Scotland, helping to achieve those investments. [Hon. Members: "Where is he?"] Hon. Gentlemen's ask where my hon. Friend is. He is presiding over the successful Europartenariat conference. With the support of Opposition parties, he played an important role in bringing it to Glasgow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following discussions during my inward investment mission to the far east in October, and that of my hon. Friend the Minister responsible for industry to the United States earlier in the same month, I am confident that further projects will be secured for Scotland. The Government will continue to play their full part both in sustaining the important stock of investors we already have and in seeking to attract more inward investment to Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State ran through a catalogue of successful and new inward investment, but he omitted to mention one company in East Kilbride which has recently closed down and moved to the Republic of Ireland. Will he confirm that the Scottish Office has reported the Republic of Ireland to the European Commission and tell us when we will receive a report on that? If unfair practices have taken place, we have to protect Scottish jobs as vigorously as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot answer the hon. Gentleman now, but I shall do so as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many incoming companies see Scotland as a natural springboard for access to the European market. This is, of course, an even stronger consideration now that the single European market is a reality. I believe that Scottish business is well placed to benefit from the single market and the opportunities it presents. However, if it is to make the fullest use of those opportunities, it must be competitive.
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
That is why the Government have set such a high priority on improvement of the transport infrastructure. The continued improvement in the infrastructure is, I believe, the second key component of the Government's economic strategy in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all accept the importance of Europe in the future of our economy. In that context, will payments for hill livestock compensatory amounts and for fishing instruments of the guidance programme in the highlands and islands be deducted from Objective 1 money? Does not that defeat the purpose of additionality for that vital area? Is not it more important that we ensure that Objective 1 funding is spent on improving the infrastructure, especially that of transport, so that our industry in the north can compete equally on a so-called level playing field?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite sure what the hon. Lady is asking.

We are negotiating over Objective 2. On the common agricultural policy, the total agriculture budget is increasing by 16.5 per cent. this year following an increase of more than 40 per cent. last year, with special help in the hill livestock compensatory allowance areas of the highlands. The overall picture is extremely good and must be looked at as a whole and not as individual components because the HLCA reductions of £9.5 million is offset by considerable increases for cow and sheep premiums.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Investment in trunk roads in Scotland is at record levels. Schemes worth some £380 million are currently under construction, including the A74 upgrading, schemes on the central Scotland motorway network and improvements to the A96 and A1. A 12-mile section of the M80—a road close to your heart, Mr. Hogg—from Stepps to Haggs is under close consideration with a view to publishing the proposed line next spring.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The success of inward investment and the continued development of the infrastructure constitute two of the main components of the Government's economic strategy in Scotland. There is one further, very significant, component. I believe that we in Scotland were particularly fortunate to have put in place an extensive new network to help Scottish business—in the form of Scottish Enterprise, Highlands and Islands Enterprise and the local enterprise companies—just at the time when the recession was beginning to bite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The enterprise networks have played a vital role in helping Scottish companies to develop business opportunities, and they have shown their capability for that role at a particularly challenging time. That is why I decided to give priority to the budgets of the enterprise bodies in my overall expenditure decisions. We plan to spend £1.3 billion over the next three years on Scottish Enterprise alone. Next year, Scottish Enterprise will receive neary £452 million from the Government, an increase of £11.5 million over 1993–94 plans. There is nothing comparable to this south of the border, either in terms of the volume of resources or of the range of powers available to the enterprise networks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise particularly the value of the enterprise networks' integrated approach, which has found expression in several ways. I particularly commend the recent initiative by Scottish Enterprise of launching a strategy aimed at improving the business birth rate in Scotland. This work represents the single largest research project ever undertaken in Scotland on the key issue of new business formation, and it has positive implications for virtually every person in the country. By scrutinising the issue at every level, the study has identified some of the main factors which have inhibited Scotland from creating as many new businesses as elsewhere in the United Kingdom and overseas, and it has identified clearly methods of reversing the trend. This is exactly the sort of initiative that we need if we are to encourage the type of new business development on which our economic progress so vitally depends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall finish this section first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part of the integrated approach—a vital one and one that I commend—is the enterprise networks' achievements on training. We have seen, for instance, a large increase in the proportion of those in youth training who have attained employed status. This has almost doubled from just over 20 per cent. in April 1991 to over 40 per cent. at present. The numbers of those attaining vocational qualifications have increased fourfold over the same period. These
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
achievements are impressive, and they reflect a commitment to increasing our skills base in ways which are relevant to employers' needs. Taken together with the work being done on economic development, they strongly justify the integrated approach built into the enterprise networks and they represent a massive investment in the Scottish economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs has completed its work on Scottish Enterprise, does the Secretary of State expect that report to be published, although Conservative Members on that Committee received instructions to suppress it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that there is a new economic confidence abroad in Scotland which even the talking down of the Opposition parties cannot dim. Immense strides have been made in recent years. The transformation from an economy dependent on a narrow range of declining industries to one with a broad mix of modern industrial sectors is well advanced. Scotland is rapidly progressing towards a modem industrial society, now competing effectively not only in Europe but in the wider world. It is the Government's determination to hasten that process until the transformation of the Scottish economy is complete and we have a strong, confident, self-sustaining, diverse, economic base on which enterprise can grow and flourish, and receive the respect that it deserves. In the recent Budget and in our decisions on public expenditure we have given proof of our commitment and we shall continue to work towards an economic future for Scotland which offers the Scottish people a prospect of continued growth and prosperity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a consensus in Scotland. The Secretary of State may not want to recognise it, but we in the House share a belief in Scotland, in the Scottish economy and in the necessity to take measures that will improve Scotland's strength, competitiveness and the number of jobs for Scots. We agree about that: no one is interested in talking down the Scottish economy or those who are making an effort. However, we find it difficult to recognise the Scottish economy from the Secretary of State's description of it, which does not accord with anything that Members of Parliament and the public see in Scotland today. No bandying of statistics or last week's jiggery-pokery and finessing of the figures will help a bad situation, which the Budget has done nothing to improve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman always struck me as being a fair man. Does he acknowledge that in the European Community, on which he is alleged to be an expert, there are massive industrial and economic problems? It is, therefore, not unrealistic to compare Scotland's position with that of the rest of the European Community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, it is relevant to make comparisons with what is happening in the European Community and beyond. But the fact that we are sixth in the Group of Seven industrial nations in terms of industrial investment should tell even the hon. Gentleman something about the state that this country has been brought to. The Secretary of State rightly said that the future of the Scottish economy was inextricably connected with the condition of the British economy. Our position in relation to the other major industrialised countries shows the Conservative Government's measure of success in attracting industrial investment after 14 years in office.

The Secretary of State for Scotland has been complaining that because of alleged posturing by the Labour party, he cannot go to the European Parliament in Strasbourg this week to fly the flag for Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not want the hon. Gentleman to misunderstand the position. I have made no such complaint.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Secretary of State going to Strasbourg?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister of State is going in my place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister of State does not have a vote in the House of Commons. I was told yesterday by a reputable source in the media in Scotland that the Secretary of State was complaining that he was being prevented from going. I know that there has been an upset. The Secretary of State was supposed to be going to Strasbourg this week, allegedly to fly the flag for Scotland at the Scottish week there. Now it appears that he is not going. Lord Fraser of Carmyllie will go in his place, because the Secretary of State cannot get paired. The reason for that is that the Government, in their arrogance, decided that two major Bills were to go through all their stages in the House of Commons in two days this week. One of those Bills will transfer liability for sick pay to employers at a net cost to industry of some £700 million. The other Bill will increase national insurance contributions for every employee in Britain by 1 per cent. That is a huge tax increase imposed despite the explicit, "read my lips" election promise made last year by the Prime Minister, who said on 28 January 1992:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have no plans to raise … the level of national insurance contributions."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 28 January 1992; Vol. 202, c. 808]</p></blockquote>
Not only have the Government broken their promise, but they hope to get through all stages of the relevant Bill in one day this week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State and his Cabinet colleagues seem drunk on their political power. After 14 years they have become careless about their promises. The Government's brass neck has evolved into a flagrant carelessness about Parliament, but I can tell the Secretary of State that he and other Ministers will be free to travel to the Parliament at Strasbourg only when the Government are willing to respect the Parliament here at Westminster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One wonders which flag the Secretary of State for Scotland was intending to fly at Scottish week in Strasbourg. Would it have been the flag of the United Kingdom or that of the Conservative party, given that all the interests of Britain and Scotland are subordinate to the attempt to keep together the different European factions fighting within the Tory party? Those factions battle like ferrets in a sack, but without the good humour displayed by
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
those animals. It is a pity that the beaming smile on the face of the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) cannot be treasured by a television audience, but I can see the rays of the hon. Gentleman's smile shine from behind the Secretary of State's head as he reflects upon that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman. He spoke of ferrets fighting in a bag in reference to the supposed disputes over Europe within the Conservative party. Is not the Labour party like a bagful of weasels? Labour Members weasel away with their words and with their interpretation of European involvement, yet a vast range of differences exists among the Labour Members sitting behind the hon.

A Spanish diplomat was quoted as saying after last weekend's European Council meeting, at which Britain was represented by the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that there
	<br><blockquote><p>"were clearly two British delegations at this European Council."</p></blockquote>
One delegation was led by the Chancellor. It attacked Mr. Delors' proposals for building European economic recovery as a
	<br><blockquote><p>"late-in-the-day, rather sensational document".</p></blockquote>
The Chancellor said that before he read the document. The other delegation was led by the Prime Minister. His opinion of the document, when he had read it, was that it was "intellectually impressive". He apologised for the Chancellor's intemperate language. Saturday's headline in 	<i>the Glasgow Herald</i> was
	<br><blockquote><p>"Major Blocks Plan to Create 15 Million Jobs".</p></blockquote>
That said it all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government and the Secretary of State, despite more than 250,000 unemployed people in Scotland, feel proud of their attempt to veto a plan that would create jobs. That attempt came just before, pressure from the Community forced them, against their will, finally to accept the plan. Today, the Secretary of State has the cheek to tell us that our Community partners have not steered their way through recession as successfully as we have. The Government took us into recession before anybody else, and did so twice. They gave us a deeper recession than anyone else has had and a longer one than this country has experienced since the 1930s. But still, they blame the rest of Europe for the problem that they have created and that we have got.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When Europe produces a plan to help to get Scotland's 250,000 jobless people and Europe's 18 million jobless people back to work, the Tories, flying the flag of Tory unity, rubbish it before they even have had a chance to read it. They then sign up to it at the end of the day. Small surprise that, in reference to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Delors said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Ignorance doesn't prevent you from getting on as a good politician, but if you know what you are talking about, it is sometimes quite helpful."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0014">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
Mr. Delors often has exactly the right words. Perhaps it is just as well that the Secretary of State for Scotland is not out there in Strasbourg, attempting to fly the flag for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is that, at home, the Tories are just as much of a disaster, as the recent Budget all so clearly showed. Two weeks ago, Tory Back-Bench Members cheered as the Chancellor announced the biggest tax hike in British history. Now the waving Order Papers have gone soggy and the cheers have turned to tears, as it dawns on all those Tory Back-Bench Members just what the Chancellor of the Exchequer actually sold to diem that afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are £24 billion of extra taxes, and 19 of every 20 households in the United Kingdom will lose from the Budget. From October of next year, every typical family will pay an extra £10 a week and, from April 1995, an extra £16 a week. The party that promised us tax cuts year on year is now delivering a tax increase every six months. There is a new tax on insurance on both cars and the home; a new tax on travel imposed on those who will be travelling between Scotland and London each week; and cuts in unemployment pay and invalidity benefit. Instead of attacking unemployment, the Government attack the unemployed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should make no mistake about the effect that the Budget will have on the Scottish economy, which will be severe. Demand will be hit badly by the tax bombshell, as well as the proposed public expenditure cuts. It will be the biggest blow to demand in the country in 50 years, and it will hit jobs and investment. As I have said before, that is at a time when Britain is sixth out of seven in terms of investment in the G7, the largest industrialised countries in the world, and 23rd out of the 24 Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Demand does matter. The Glasgow chamber of commerce is not known for its left-leaning sympathies, but Mr. Ian Ogle, who is its president, stated in its December magazine:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As always, there is no easy answer as has already been proved by the Government's announced intention to impose VAT on domestic fuel bills. VAT cuts both ways—it is an effective revenue raiser but one which might have the effect of slowing down a consumer led recovery, which is itself fragile enough to need careful nourishment."</p></blockquote>
That is an industrialist with experience, who made that point before the Budget, when the Government heaped more tax increases on top of the existing ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Ogle was even more profound in the article, when he stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Quite simply we fail to take account of the fact that when things are going badly, they can get even worse."</p></blockquote>
That came from a man of some perception who was writing before the Budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The latest CBI industrial trends survey—the Secretary of State had the cheek to quote from it—made it clear that over the past three years uncertainty about demand has been the main constraint on investment in this country. Will the Government listen to no one other than the same demented, mistaken gurus who have piloted economic policy up to today?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The imposition of VAT on fuel will hurt many of those who are above the level at which compensation will be granted, and even the people who will receive 50p a week. I was at Haghill community hall yesterday. Pensioners there
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
and in Alexandra Park ridiculed the 50p a week increase in their pensions to cover VAT on fuel. The compensation equals two bus fares.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point and I am sure that it is parliamentary to say that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the impact of the public expenditure cuts that will be heaped on top of the reduction in demand that will result from the Budget. The penalties for the Scottish economy come not only from the tax mountain that will be piled on top of industry and commerce, but from the substantial cuts in public spending in Scotland next year. The Secretary of State for Scotland was open about his intentions. On 4 October he stated to the Glasgow junior chamber of commerce that
	<br><blockquote><p>"my colleagues and I will be taking difficult and unpopular decisions—and I mean cuts in some areas—but we have to do it. The country is living beyond its means and we have to balance the books."</p></blockquote>
That is somewhat different from what the Prime Minister said last year when referring to the same subject of public expenditure. On 30 March before the general election—I am sure that that was coincidence—the Prime Minister said that if the Government were going to cut public expenditure, they would have done so before. He did not believe that it would be economically right and that any prospect of that could be ruled out. In the Budget this year the Government cut public expenditure by £3.6 billion next
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0015">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
year. In Scotland, after the Government's assumption of inflation, the real cut in public expenditure will be £95 million. The lesson is self-evident—Tory promises are worthless: read their lips; they simply do not tell the truth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's assumption in the Red Book is that inflation will be 3.75 per cent—that is not a guess, a hope or an aspiration, nor is it a figure plucked out of thin air, but a Treasury assumption, and there are no more conservative people than those in the Treasury. Inflation next year will be 3.75 per cent and in the following year it will be 4 per cent. The cuts contrast to all the hype of last week's statements—they will be stark and severe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The housing budget will be cut by £12 million next year in real terms. The law-and-order budget will be cut next year by £6 million in real terms, and are well aware of all the law-and-order problems. Government support for local councils will be cut by £163 million next year, and that will feed through to every service provided by local councils in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That will not be the end of it. The Government have given up the idea of year-on-year budgets. They have published figures for the next three years that state that the Scottish budget will be cut by £266 million. The housing budget will be cut by £67 million, the law-and-order budget by £28 million and the local council budget by between £278 million and £330 million. I look forward to the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South defending that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is criticising the spending plans announced by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is criticising the spending plans announced by my right hon.

Friend the shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is so repetitious and it is no more effective than Tom Forrest's repetitions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer made it clear that if the Government meant what they said about closing tax loopholes, instead of imposing a pay freeze on those working in the public sector, they could penalise some of those who are getting off scot free. At least the hint was taken in the budget two weeks ago that they could save £10 billion of public expenditure by closing the real loopholes. Let us hear no more from Conservative Members about where the money could come from if they are not even willing to collect existing taxes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is somewhat entertaining, if one can be entertained in present circumstances, to hear the Government and the Secretary of State say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The country is living beyond its means and we have to balance the books."</p></blockquote>
They have been in power for 14 years. How on earth have we come to be living beyond our means?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook), in his brilliant speech last week on the Budget, pointed out that Mr. Bill Robinson, an advisor to the previous Chancellor, has published a pamphlet showing precisely how it is that the Budget has got out of control and why the country is living beyond it means, he said that
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"the deficit mushroomed under the Government's policies: £22 billion from the extra costs of unemployment as a result of their economic strategy; £20 billion as a result of the tax cuts of 1988, which they now find they cannot afford; and £4 billion as a result of the introduction of the poll tax"—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 7 December 1993; Vol. 234, c. 160.].</p></blockquote>
That has left us with a permanently lower tax base.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are living beyond our means, but who will suffer? The housing budget will suffer because the housing budget in Scotland will be cut to pay the price of 14 years of economic mismanagement. Why talk about housing? Every member of the Committee knows how important housing is to our constituents and to the country as a whole. Activity in housing is the quickest way in which effectively to stimulate the economy. Why, therefore, are the Government cutting the housing budget in real terms by £12 million at the same time as increasing the agriculture budget by £44 million in real terms? Where is the economic rationale in that? We know the nature of the problem. The Secretary of State spoke of it last week when he talked about homelessness, housing below a tolerable standard, dampness and condensation. He knows the extent of the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I wish to conclude my remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was a pure question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The idea of the hon. Gentleman asking a pure question lends a new meaning to "pure".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about a housing crisis of monumental proportions, including dampness, homelessness, condensation and the attendant problems. At the same time, a record number of construction workers are on the dole or, to use the new expression, are job-seeking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is important. In that one area, the Secretary of State could have escaped from the glossy pamphlets and done something to help the condition of the Scottish people and stimulate the Scottish economy. Instead, he opted to cut and cut, and he expects people in damp houses and the homeless to pay the price for a deficit that has been accumulated over 14 years by the Government's incompetence. The Government could have done something, but they failed to do anything. They tinned down that opportunity, yet they continue to approve vast increases in spending in areas in which it makes no sense to spend. The Budget tax blows and the public expenditure cuts that have been made during the past few years will assuredly knock confidence, reduce demand and further enfeeble any chance of the Scottish economy recovering. The Government have had their chance to stimulate the economy of Scotland—they had a duty to do so—but they blew that opportunity. It is time for someone else to do what the country needs, and only the Labour party can do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Kynoch 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a great pleasure to speak in today's debate because we must strike a balance. Having listened to the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson), I question whether he and I live in the same country—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] The Labour party does not recognise that the United Kingdom has gone through a significant and deep recession, as has the rest of the world. Having been in business before I became a Member of Parliament, I know just how deep that recession
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0016">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
was in other countries at the time when we were beginning to encounter difficulties in Britain. However, one thing is clear: the Government have recognised the difficulties, have addressed them and created conditions in which business can thrive. It was interesting to hear the hon. Member for Hamilton say that he did not want to talk down Scotland, yet he talked down absolutely everything of a positive nature that the Government have achieved. I shall refer to some of the Government's positive achievements, but the fact of life is that Scottish business, in particular, is very involved in exporting and fighting in world markets. It is, therefore, critical to Scottish businesses that economic conditions are suitable for them to compete on a level playing field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now have a competitive pound. We have inflation at the incredibly low level of 1·4 per cent—the lowest for some 30 years. We also have interest rates at a record low. With all those constituent parts, businesses are well placed to seize opportunities when and if they arise, although we still cannot escape the fact that they are trading in difficult world conditions. We cannot escape the fact that Germany is deep in recession. As one of the largest home market EC countries, it is causing difficulties for our exporters. But businesses are out there, they are fighting and they are succeeding. The hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) should realise that they deserve praise and encouragement instead of being knocked for the sake of knocking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State drew attention to the fact that between 1981 and 1991, growth in the Scottish economy averaged 2·4 per cent per annum. How does that compare with the growth rate when the Labour party was in power? The growth rate was less than 1 per cent between 1974 and 1979, when the Labour party was in power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the difficult times that I have described—world recessionary times—manufacturing output in Scotland in 1992 was 9 per cent. higher than in 1986—in the depth of recession. Manufacturing industry deserves to be praised and not to be knocked as the hon. Member for Hamilton continues to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman used the figure quoted by the Secretary of State—2.4 per cent. growth—although the hon. Gentleman was honest enough to tell us which period he was using for comparison: 1981–91. He has missed out the whole of the 1979–81 recession and part of the current recession. If a proper comparison from 1979 was made, the hon. Gentleman would know that the figure for Scottish growth was 1.7 per cent. and not 2.4 per cent. Why cannot he be a bit more honest with the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that I was being honest. I do not think that he is being as honest as I am. Between 1981 and 1991, we had growth of 2.4 per cent. per annum. It must be accepted that that is no mean achievement. One should also note the number of self-employed people in Scotland. As my right hon. Friend said, we have put much effort into encouraging people to start up their own businesses through local enterprise companies. My local enterprise companies—Grampian Enterprise and Kincardine and Deeside Enterprise Trust—successfully run courses for people who want to start up new businesses. The number of people taking up those courses is greater
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
then ever and the number who succeed in starting and maintaining businesses is higher than ever. In June 1993, the number of self-employed people in Scotland had increased by 5.1 per cent. since June 1992. That is hardly a story of lack of success, but one of positive results, yet again, under this Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we discuss unemployment, Opposition Members put forward negative figures. Unemployment in Scotland is now, and has consistently been, below United Kingdom levels in percentage terms. For the past 22 months, Scotland's unemployment level has been below that of the United Kingdom for the first time since the 1920s. If we consider the positive side and compare the percentage of the working population in work with the percentage for other EC countries, we find that Scotland is right at the top of the table in the top three. Those are the positive points that we should be considering instead of constantly knocking, as Opposition Members continue to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend also referred to the most recent CBI survey on industrial trends—that for 1993—which shows that business confidence among manufacturers has increased for the fourth consecutive quarter. How can that possibly be ignored? The conditions and the strategy are there—businesses have it in place—and they can now go out and fight with confidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making much of limited statistics. What does he make of the 	<i>Scottish Business Insider</i> survey of 220 chairman, chief executives and finance directors in Scotland only a month ago in which six out of 10 concluded that the Government were not confident in their management of the economy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That contradicts the comments that I hear in my constituency and from business men on the ground. I never believe surveys and polls. There is only one poll that counts and I know from experience that my personal contacts are much more valid than surveys in the press.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend ask the Opposition which Governments, in any industrialised country in the middle of a recession, are popular?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valid point. When there are difficult trading conditions and a world recession, difficult decisions must be taken. In some respects, it is much easier to oppose than to govern. That is an experience that the Opposition will not have in a long, long time.

To return to the CBI industrial trends survey, I note that is records that export orders and deliveries are up again. That is good news, which should be published. Scottish manufacturing exports were better than those of the rest of the United Kingdom in four of the past five years—1987, 1988, 1990 and 1991—for which figures are available, yet constantly the Opposition knock the Government's policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend referred to his trip with the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the Minister for Industry and Local Government, to the far east. I commend him and his team for their efforts to bring inward investment to Scotland. Some 96,000 jobs have been created or safeguarded since the start of Locate in Scotland and £5 billion has been invested. Those are no mean figures; it is a great success story. Scottish Enterprise, Locate in Scotland and the Scottish Office team deserve credit for that. As my right hon. Friend said, that success is the entry point into Europe. We are playing our part and leading in Europe.

Reference was made to the unified Budget. My party recognises the need for responsible management of the economy. Public sector borrowing is too high. The hon. Member for Hamilton does not recognise that spending, spending, spending must be financed and that interest costs must be paid before any other public expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should welcome the good news in Scotland in the unified Budget. The Scotch whisky industry, which lobbied hard and long for duty to be on a level playing field, welcomes the unified Budget. For a second year, the duty on spirits has been frozen. I agree with the industry that this is a good Budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is extra Export Credit Guarantees Department cover to help exporters and some premium rates have been reduced by 20 per cent. When I was in business, the ECGD rates were believed to be high; ECGD was believed never to help as much as it should. It was always felt that it did not take risks, yet now it is making a positive contribution to help exporters to fight for export markets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw attention to two announcements of capital expenditure with private sector involvement: the west coast railway line improvement and the air traffic control centre at Prestwick. Both are exceedingly good news for Scotland. I hope that my right hon. Friend will also consider the east coast railway line. He is aware that a feasibility study is being carried out on the electrification of the railway line north of Edinburgh to Aberdeen. Aberdeen is a centre for the oil industry and rail links with Europe are most important for this major export market in Scotland. There is a strong case for a non-stop, electrified through link from Aberdeen to the south and on to the continent. I hope that the Secretary of State will address that matter in his reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The unified Budget has helped small businesses by raising the VAT threshold to £45,000. The removal of the audit requirement for companies with turnovers of less than £90,000 has also helped small businesses. The Government are resolute about cutting bureaucracy for small businesses. They are determined to deregulate and to make it easier for businesses to thrive and prosper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we consider the content of the public expenditure statement that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State made recently, it is amusing to hear the Opposition talk, rather embarrassedly, about cuts. There has been an increase in public expenditure. The Opposition did not mention health. Health spending has increased by 5 per cent [	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Hamilton is not good at arithmetic. He said that the Red Book referred to 3.4 per cent inflation. I calculate that 3.4 per cent subtracted from 5 per cent is 1.6 per cent. That constitutes a real increase at a time when the Opposition talk about cuts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin O'Neill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clackmannan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is suggesting the retail prices index should constitute the measure by which an increase in health spending is judged, he clearly knows nothing about health statistics. Health requires about 3 per cent. per annum in real terms to protect the other changes that affect health service prices. The hon. Gentleman does not make a valid comparison; his figures are meaningless.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am well aware of what the hon. Gentleman means. However, he does not acknowledge the other significant improvements that have occurred in the health service through the operation of trusts. I have only to look to local trusts in north-east Scotland, for example the Aberdeen royal hospitals NHS trust and the Grampian
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
health care trust, to recognise the improved services in the health service. Primary health care and caring for patients receive a better allocation of funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was pleased that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State mentioned the industry, enterprise and training budget. The 10 per cent. increase in allocated resources is welcome. It will help further to generate wealth in the community. Local enterprises work well and work hard. They are able to interpret national policies locally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also welcome the 5 per cent. positive increase in the roads and transport programme. I have frequently travelled south from Aberdeen to Edinburgh and I know that the Government have spent significantly on that road to improve it by making it a dual carriageway. When the road is complete, there should be a dual carriageway from Aberdeen to the south coast. I hope that the whole of Scotland welcomes that as a good move towards improving infrastructure and opportunities for exporters. However, I ask my right hon. Friend to consider a small cosmetic point when the last section of dual carriageway is open. Due to the changes in the road structure in Scotland south of Aberdeen, there is a hotch-potch of road numbers. When one reaches Edinburgh, one hits the A1, which extends the whole way south. I hope that my hon. Friend will consider simplification and redesignation and that he will classify the main dual carriageway route from the south to Aberdeen as the A1. Why should not Scotland have a main road that is called the A1? It would clarify matters and make it easier for tourists who visit the north not to diverge off the road, and not to stop at Edinburgh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Oil is the major industry of Aberdeen, which forms part of my constituency. I commend the Government for what they have done for the oil industry when the industry is undergoing significant change because of oil prices. The Brent crude price for February was today quoted at $13·70, which is less than half its price 10 years ago. The oil industry is attacking the problem as it should. It has held a conference called "CRINE"—cost reduction in the new era. The oil industry is helped and encouraged by the Government. The Minister for Energy suggested last year that the Government should examine cost reductions and face the facts of lower oil prices; they are doing that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also hope that we can welcome the transfer by the Department of Trade and Industry of civil servants to Aberdeen, and that that move will take place as swiftly and as soon as possible. There is no doubt that industry has followed the Government's lead and that many industries will start to base themselves in Aberdeen. That will help to compensate for the significant transitional changes that are necessary at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a way, I am impressed with the gloss that the hon. Gentleman is putting on the Government's attempts to cover up the mess that has been made over the past 14 years. However, will the hon.

If so, how does he account for the condemnation with which the proposed change has been greeted by every business association?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will have to wait for that debate. However, an overview of the proposals reveals both pluses and minuses. A reduction in the national

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scotland has the people, the products, the expertise and, thanks to the Government, the economic conditions—a low pound, low inflation and low interest rates—to provide the incentive and environment necessary for private enterprise to flourish. The Government should be commended, not knocked. In very difficult trading times, it is easy to knock negative things. However, I am proud of what the Government have done over the past 14 years. I believe that they will continue to thrive and that they will remain in office for many years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.46 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I concentrate on the Scottish Enterprise network—which is the subject of an inquiry by the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs and which is greatly worrying a number of hon. Members—I wish to comment on two matters that were raised earlier in the debate. First, the Secretary of State did not appear fully to understand or to appreciate the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing), who noted that objective 1 status for the highlands and islands would include some elements that already form part of current funding for that area. Evidence for that contention can be found in a letter dated 26 November from European Commissioner Bruce Millan to one of my hon. Friend's constituents. That letter seems to suggest that the hill livestock compensatory allowances will be taken out and counted as part of the objective 1 funding. That seems to be contrary to the European principle of additionality, under which objective 1 funding should be in addition to current support, not instead of it. The reply by the Secretary of State did not address the point made by my hon. Friend, and I hope that the Under-Secretary of State will deal with it more fully later. Great anxiety will be aroused in the highlands and islands if the objective 1 kitty, which is the subject of much anticipation in that area, is robbed to finance the current expenditure on items such as hill livestock payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch) appeared to engage in some statistical jiggery pokery, but he blew the gaffe on the earlier claim by the Secretary of State that the Scottish economy had grown by 2.4 per cent. a year. Such a figure can be arrived at only by missing out half the current recession and all the severe recession of the early 1980s. The Secretary of State has no influence on the overall growth rate of the Scottish economy. The real growth rate since 1979 is 1.7 per cent. per year, which is identical to that of the United Kingdom as a whole. That growth rate has been determined by the economic policy pursued by successive Chancellors of the Exchequer since 1979. By virtually any international comparison, average growth of 1.7 per cent. per year since 1979 is very disappointing, expecially when we recall that employment in the oil industry in Scotland is now well into six figures as a result of growth throughout the 1980s. If the Secretary of State were able to admit it, he could say only that Scottish economic growth during the period of Conservative Government has been identical to that of the rest of the United Kingdom and therefore very poor in international terms. It is a hugely disappointing performance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that one should, for some peculiar reason, leave the oil industry out of the Scottish economy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the contrary, I am suggesting that we should think of including the oil industry. If the Secretary of State is boasting that the Conservative party's stewardship of the Scottish economy since 1979 has enabled our growth rate only to equal the United Kingdom's average growth rate, that is disappointing in international terms. Despite the huge bonus of the expanding oil industry in the Scottish economy during that time—presumably neither the Secretary of State nor even the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside would claim the credit for that—the performance of the Scottish economy has been at the United Kingdom average only. That suggests a very disappointing perfomance by the Scottish economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State for Scotland, has no influence over aggregate factors; they are matters decided by his colleagues in central Government. After the disastrous loss and boom of the late 1980s, it was decided to apply severe retrenchment to the economy in the late 1980s. Although the Scottish economy was nowhere near the point of overheating, Scotland had to suffer the same mechanisms to cool down demand as those being applied to the economic problems of south-east England. Within that aggregate demand picture, it is hardly surprising that the Scottish economic performance is no better—and no worse—than the very disappointing UK average.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to talk about the one element of Scottish economic performance over which the Secretary of State for Scotland has control and influence, and to study the way in which he has discharged that stewardship over the past few years. It is only four years since the Secretary of State—then a Minister of the Scottish Office—his then boss the right hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands and Mr. Bill Hughes announced in another fanfare of publicity at the Dunblane hydro that they were dismantling the structure of the Scottish Development Agency and putting in its place a new body called Scottish Enterprise which was intended, according to Mr. Hughes, to eliminate Scottish unemployment over a period of time. I do not know what time scale we are on for the full discharging of that proposal. Perhaps the Minister will tell us what the time scale is for the elimination of Scottish unemployment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that fanfare of publicity at the Dunblane hydro, great things were claimed for the new body called Scottish Enterprise and we were told how superior it would be to the Scottish Development Agency, which it replaced. I suggest that the record does not bear out the boasts that were made four years ago. In fact, within the Scottish Enterprise network, several serious problems are emerging. There have been problems in Dumfries and Galloway, close to the Secretary of State's heart. There are problems in my constituency of Banff and Buchan, where the local enterprise company has gone into liquidation. Many hon. Members are aware of severe problems in their local enterprise companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must question whether the hon. Gentleman got that fact right. I do not think that the local enterprise company has gone into liquidation. Perhaps a local enterprise trust—a customer of the local enterprise company—has gone into liquidation. The local enterprise
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0019">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
company, Grampian Enterprise, is very successful in the north-east of Scotland and I think that the hon. Gentleman should give it credit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall discuss Grampian Enterprise in a few minutes. The delivery mechanism in Banff and Buchan has gone into liquidation. In Dumfries and Galloway, there are severe problems. Forth Valley Enterprise is so worried about some of the questions being asked around the enterprise network that it has introduced a mechanism by which members of the enterprise company must declare their interest in the variety of local companies that might be assisted by the LECs. That proposal has been considered by other LECs the length and breadth of Scotland. I hope that the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside will not approach the Select Committee investigation with the view that everything in the local enterprise garden is lovely because that does not tally with people's experience throughout the country. I shall suggest some reasons why we are encountering such difficulties within the LEC structure, drawn from experiences of the Banff and Buchan local enterprise trust. It is difficult for investment and training practitioners to deliver the services in a professional manner when the board is composed of people from local businesses who clearly have an immediate and vested interest in many of the companies that might qualify for assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One does not have to argue that there is a direct link of corruption between board members and the investment and training links. It is reasonable to say that any investment professional will look over his shoulder to see whether any assisted local company is represented on his own board. Clearly, board members will feel resentful if their companies are in some way disadvantaged compared with other companies that are not represented on the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a severe risk that the professionalism that was built up over several years under the Scottish Development Agency has been thrown away in the past three to four years. There are severe question marks about the ability of the present structure to deliver the investment and training service in a totally professional manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also question what has been done to the property division of the former Scottish Development Agency. It is three years since the property division was disposed of and since the assets of £100 million plus were recouped by the Treasury. We now read in the Scottish press that the Scottish Enterprise central network is extremely concerned about the lack of available property and about the lack of advance factories on suitable sites across Scotland for the attraction of inward investment and for the relocation of existing business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon McMaster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in that point because local authorities in Scotland provide many advance factory units. I wonder how that will continue if the hon. Gentleman pursues the policies outlined in a leaflet distributed in Glasgow today. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Militant have a number of good policies, like an amnesty for poll tax non-payers".</p></blockquote>
How will the hon. Gentleman raise the funds to replace those lost as a result of that amnesty?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certain categories of people who did not pay the poll tax should be considered sympathetically by local authorities. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman reads
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
Scottish National Party literature so avidly—even literature that was distributed only this morning in Glasgow. I welcome the fact that the SNP is so active in one particular Glasgow campaign.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon. Gentleman would not want to deflect me further from what is a serious matter in his constituency and in many others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only three years ago, the property division had to discharge its assets, recouping more than £100 million for the Treasury. Now we find that Scottish Enterprise is seriously concerned about the level of assets in its control. There has been a sharp reversal of policy. Will the Minister tell us whether the £ 100 million recouped by the Treasury in the disposal of the former Scottish Development Agency—now Scottish Enterprise—property assets and in then-forced sale, against the wishes of the investment professionals, will be available to re-establish advance factories—property assets that Scottish Enterprise can use—or whether Scottish Enterprise will have to purchase new property assets from its existing budget?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried, too, about whether there will be a return to the time when one enterprise company competed against another for inward investments. One of the best things to emerge from the Scottish Development Agency was the ending of the chaos and confusion of individual local authorities competing with each other and of then-delegations abroad competing for investment. There was a single-door approach to the Scottish economy. There are worrying signs in the local enterprise structure that that approach is starting to collapse as one enterprise company competes against another for inward investment in then-area. I want the Minister's assurance that the policy is to retain the single-door approach for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The background to the dismantling of the SDA is interesting. Several recent publications have given us an insight into that background. In his book "The Hollow Drum", Arnold Kemp, formerly editor of the 	<i>Glasgow Herald,</i> quotes from an interview with Bill Hughes, the progenitor of the Scottish Enterprise network, which seems to me to demonstrate that the move from the SDA to Scottish Enterprise was intended not to improve the Scottish economy but to dismantle the last shred of corporatism remaining from the 1970s. A purely political agenda was pursued in the dismantling of the SDA and the establishment of Scottish Enterprise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is confirmation of that view in Lady Thatcher's memoirs. She holds up the dismantling of the SDA as one of her few triumphs in influencing the Scottish political scene. Does the Minister still consider there to be a clear political agenda behind the deployment of Scottish Enterprise? If there is, it is a political agenda going very badly wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not making criticisms and voicing concerns about the performance of Scottish Enterprise in order to criticise the staff, who I know are working extremely hard to make the best of a botched job. I recall a brilliant performance by Crawford Beveridge of Scottish Enterprise on the question of relocation of oil jobs to Aberdeen and the north-east during a sitting of the Select Committee on Energy in a previous Session. I am sure that the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside would have welcomed that had he been a Member of Parliament at that time. All I can say is that in that one performance before the Select Committee,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0020">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
Mr. Beveridge did more to bring about that deployment than 10 years of non effort by successive Secretaries of State for Scotland. I have an extremely high regard for the staff—especially those at the centre—of the Scottish Enterprise network.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is substantial evidence that in the one area of economic policy in Scotland over which the Secretary of State has had some control and influence during recent years, he has deployed that influence in an extremely cavalier manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless something is done and the clear deficiences which are emerging in the network are addressed, the damage to the Scottish economy during future years will be severe. In the one limited area of the Scottish economy where the Secretary of State has some influence, he is exercising a dead hand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.2 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to be unashamedly parochial today—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Yes, it is a terrible thing. Talking about the Scottish economy, I make particular reference to Fife and my constituency of Kirkcaldy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first issue that I want to bring to the Minister's attention is the Frances colliery at Dysart. The colliery is dormant following a fire in 1985. It lies on top of 100 million tonnes of the best quality coal that this country can produce. The coal is low in sulphur and low in chlorine and is a priceless asset for our economic future. I recognise that there is no immediate prospect of that asset being developed—not as British Coal is behaving at present—but it is essential that the colliery be kept dry by pumping and that it be maintained so that the assets are not sterilised for ever more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
British Coal wants to close Frances colliery for two reasons: first, it costs between £1 million and £2 million a year to keep it running. There have been disgraceful attempts during the past few weeks by the management of British Coal to cut the wages of the miners who are still working at the colliery in an effort to make a small inroad into that cost—we are talking about a very small amount of money compared with the total cost of maintaining the pit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main reason why British Coal wants to close Frances colliery is because it knows that the Government intend to proceed with privatisation. If privatisation succeeds, there will be a separate Scottish coal company, which will compete with what is left of British Coal. British Coal expects the same management to remain and that is why it wants to close Frances colliery—to ensure that the Scottish coalfield is not properly equipped to compete with it in the medium to long term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State must seek further assurances from his colleagues at the Department of Trade and Industry who are responsible for energy that British Coal will be forced to keep Frances colliery going until the successor company to British Coal in Scotland is able to take over that asset and continue to maintain it for our future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point, on which I shall spend more time, is the proposed second tolled crossing over the Forth. I notice some hon. Members smiling, and it will not surprise anyone who has been following the debate during the past few months to know that I am against the construction of a
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
second tolled crossing over the Forth. I should like to explain why and to ask Ministers, even at this stage, to reconsider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Traffic volumes over the Forth are high. Traffic hold-ups are relatively infrequent. They occur at specific times; they occur during road works, accidents, if an unusual load is crossing the river and when the queues build up at tollbooths—the most common cause of hold-ups crossing the Forth—as cars queue up to pay tolls. Oddly enough, tolls are supposed to end next year. The capital debt has been paid off. When the bridge was built, an undertaking was given which we thought no honourable person would renege on, that tolls would cease once the capital debt had been paid off. Whichever party has been in power, that has always been the understanding. People from both parties, who asked for an end to tolls, were told that the tolls would cease once the bridge was built. Now, magically, we discover that tolls are to be extended for a further period and that the job of maintaining the bridge, which was never intended to fall as a specific charge on people crossing, but as a general cost on the roads budget, has been added to the debt in order to maintain tolls. Why? The answer is because the Government want a private company to build the new bridge. They will not provide the money; they want someone else to do it. If a private company is to get a return on its investment, it must charge tolls on both bridges, not only on one—it does not take a genius to work out that not many people would use the toll bridge if they could use another bridge. So, tolls are being retained as a convenient fiction until the private company takes over responsibility—not after the second bridge has been built. We shall begin to pay increased tolls four or five years before the new bridge is built because, as soon as a company has signed the contract, it will be handed over management of the present bridge and given the right to maintain and increase tolls. The company will increase tolls, make no mistake. Private companies are licking their lips at the prospect. Small wonder, because that bridge has a huge captive burden of commuters who cross it every day and who, if they must travel by road, have no alternative route. It is the only place in Scotland where private industry knows that it can get a return on the massive investment that it will have to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will tell us about their survey of road use. They will tell us that they need another bridge to carry that huge stream of traffic heading south down the major Euroroute, the A1, except that it is not a major Euroroute; the major Euroroute is the E15, which is the M74 and M6, leading to the M1. The major Euroroute is in the west of the country, not the east.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's survey tells us that only 5 per cent. of road users at peak times are heading for the centre of Edinburgh. That sounds most impressive. When I was in medicine, I was an epidemiologist, and epidemiologists are statisticians. You can do anything with statistics, but there is a need for a psychiatrist.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I have given any offence, Mr. Hogg, I apologise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's great survey states that only 5 per cent. of commuters head for the centre of Edinburgh. That is fine until we ask for a definition of the centre of Edinburgh, which is defined in the survey as a short walk from Haymarket or Waverley stations. I can believe that only 5 per cent. of those who were surveyed were heading for that square mile of Edinburgh; the remainder were also heading for Edinburgh, but for the Barnton roundabout, and there is no proposal to change that. There has been vague talk of a Barnton bypass, but if someone is travelling on to Edinburgh, there is little point in trying to get on the Corstorphine road because that is just as busy. If someone is not heading for the immediate area of the Haymarket or Waverley stations, that does not alter the fact that he may be heading for Edinburgh. The vast majority of commuter traffic heads for Edinburgh, and it is intended that those commuters will pay for the new bridge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I question the rationale of the bridge. The Government examine past trends and assume that a future increase will be based on the same trends. I could give numerous examples from my work in medicine of where that has been shown to be nonsense. The most obvious was Enoch Powell's White Paper in 1962, which stated that based on the introduction of new treatment for mental illnesses all mental hospitals would be closed by 1979. In 1985 the first mental hospital in Scotland—Glen Lomond in Fife—was closed, so the Government were a little wrong in their statistics. Future trends do not always mirror what has happened in the past. Trends may change or they may be changed, and we must remember that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened intently to the hon. Gentleman and have a couple of questions. He referred to tolls on the bridge and said that people would not be encouraged to use it if there was a choice between a free crossing and a toll crossing. However, the Forth and Kincardine bridges negate his argument to some extent. In view of the flow of traffic southwards to England and the importance of the A1, does the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the A1 should be dual carriageway. That would make an immeasurable contribution to the safety of those using the road. Trunk roads that are as busy as the A1 should not be single carriageway. Nevertheless, it is not the major route south. The new terminal for freight coming through the channel tunnel is being built at Moss End in Lanarkshire, and that is also in the west. There is an
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
alternative use for Kincardine bridge and I shall come that in a minute, but it is not an alternative for those commuting to Edinburgh from Fife.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Examples exist of roads being built to accommodate increased road use that show that it is futile to continue to build more roads. For years the M25 was touted as the solution to London's traffic problems, but as soon as it was open it was jammed with cars. It is to be extended to 10 lanes each way and I predict that it will jam up again. What do the Government intend to do? If they make it 20 lanes each way, it will jam up yet again and attract yet more traffic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A new bridge is being built over the River Severn with private money. The two-way toll, on the bridge for a lorry is £12. As lorries will be able to cross the bridge free in one direction, they will drive through beautiful villages in Gloucestershire and up both sides of the Severn to avoid paying the toll on return. Is the Minister going to tell us that the tolls on the Forth bridge will be less than £10 for a lorry? I defy him to do so. There is no question but that the tolls will be higher. They will have to be in order to pay for a much higher capital debt. The sum to build the bridge and to construct the associated road programme may be as much as £400 million. It does not take a genius to work out how much will have to be charged to pay for that. The tolls will be even higher than those already in existence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we accept that road traffic is increasing, so we must build another bridge, when will it all stop? If I continue those projections—as I have said, I am a statistician—we will need another bridge by 2010 and a fourth bridge by 2015 because of a compounded increase in use. Why not concrete over the whole lot and have done with it? Then we could walk across the Forth to Edinburgh from Kirkcaldy. We could just fill the river in. That would give us somewhere to put our rubbish. If we accept the rationale that traffic will continue to increase, sooner or later that is what we will have to do. That is manifest nonsense and it should stop now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should start from the premise that we will not build a second toll crossing. The increased traffic from a second crossing would, after all, damage the fragile environment in Edinburgh. Medical papers last week stated that fumes from car exhausts are bad for our health, although I would have thought that it would not take a learned paper to prove that. Increased traffic would cause problems for Edinburgh which it cannot take. In the long term, increased traffic would contribute to acid rain, global warming and the destruction of the ozone layer. Increased car use must stop. We should not assume that it will automatically increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about changes in working practices with more teleworking from home? That will reduce commuting in the long term. What about introducing schemes that might affect road use, such as preferential treatment for vehicles with three or four occupants instead of the 80 per cent of vehicles that cross the bridge with only one occupant? Why not tax cars with one occupant more heavily? Is it possible to introduce road pricing in Edinburgh which would reduce car use? Is it possible to tax private parking, which again might reduce car use? There are alternatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why not consider increasing rail use? An electrified line to the north, as the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside said, is essential. It would also benefit commuter traffic, as would more stations north and south of the boarder. An interchange at the airport would gladly be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0022">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
used by those of us who have to cross the Forth, although we would have to get out of Edinburgh to the airport. Park-and-ride schemes should be examined. We should be flexible and imaginative, and not just consider an oversimplistic solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about an alternative crossing at Kincardine? Kincardine bridge is unsuitable for major road use. The traffic passes through old villages. A new road is needed in west Fife to link up with the east Fife regional road which was completed a couple of years ago. The west Fife regional road could easily cross the Forth higher or lower than Kincardine. It would open up the area and encourage heavy traffic, especially if it has to pay high tolls to cross the existing Forth bridge, to move to the west, which is where it is going anyway, and take an alternative route. The higher Forth crossing at Kincardine would cost a fraction of another bridge at Queensferry. It would be the logical solution to the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before proceeding with the scheme, my colleagues and I on both sides of the Forth ask the Government to consider the alternatives. We ask for a full planning commission to be set up to examine all the available options, rather than the type of planning inquiry that might ensue once the Government have let the contract for the bridge. Such an inquiry would not examine all the issues. We want a passenger transport authority for the Forth area that will insist on rational planning for the future. We want the Government to give proper consideration to the forthright package, which offers an alternative much as I have described today. Most of all, the Government must realise that a tolled second crossing will be a heavy tax on every journey across the Forth and on every job north of the Forth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) down that line of argument, as he might then start trying to buy an aeroplane. That would make me a little agitated, as one can always make a case for banning something, whereas in the real world we must live with and welcome change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to talk about the Scottish economy we must be realistic and acknowledg today's circumstances. What are those circumstances? Scottish industry enjoys a competitive pound. There is no doubt that, in internationl trading, that helps exports. That is important for Scotland, which relies so heavily on exports. Our rate of inflation is relatively low and seems set to remain so. That must be welcomed. Also, our relatively low interest rates mean that ther is a risk-taking environment in which the people who really create jobs and market position may act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be unwise to pretend that the recession is at an end. It is at an end in Scotland, where circumstances are improving, but it has not ended in the European Union, which takes more than 50 per cent. of exports from Scotland and the United Kingdom. The hon. Member for Hamilton drew attention to the views that I espouse. I have always believed that it would be unwise to lock ourselves into a declining market. Any business man knows that he cannot aim 50 per cent. of sales at a declining market and expect nothing to change. I welcome the trip made by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and other Ministers to the far east, because the Pacific basin, China and Latin America make up the real growth areas for the next few
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
years. Scottish entrepreneurs and Scottish Enterprise should concentrate on turning those markets to our advantage. The competitive pound means that conditions are right for expansion, but that expansion will not be made within the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A few weeks ago, I visited some machine tool firms involved in the German aerospace industry. Those companies have known only prosperity and growth since the recovery after the second world war. They have never known a period of reversal, but have always had long order books and lots of overtime. The experience of such companies in Bavaria today is interesting. They are working one week for every three weeks that are spent on the German equivalent of the dole. That disguises the German unemployment figures, but it does not change the attitudes of the people who are affected so badly. It is clear that the German elections will bring the same nasty surprise that was brought to us this morning by the elections in the former Soviet Union and Russia. The growth of narrow nationalism is not unexpected in times of recession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have never been one to stop the growth of narrow nationalism, but the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not imagine that you, Mr. Hogg, and I would find ourselves defending a position against narrow nationalism. I simply made a passing reference to the fact that changes will occur in France, Italy and Belgium. The Scottish economy depends on exporting to those countries. If more than 50 per cent. of our exports go to the European Union, we cannot expect our markets to improve when we witness strikes by the Belgian public service unions, which cause chaos, the chaos in France and the turmoil in Italy. It is important to recognise that, especially for the Scotch whisky industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have helped the Scotch whisky industry in two Budgets. The industry has expressed its gratitude for the efforts of the all-party Scotch whisky group. We can all take credit for that. All members of that group went to see the Chancellor of the Exchequer and other Ministers. We persuaded them of the industry's importance and of how it should be treated in the Budget. However, such treatment will be of no value unless we can be sure that exports will continue to grow. Scotland exports more than 90 per cent. of everything that the Scotch whisky industry produces. We require our customers to have economic conditions that will ensure growth. My message to Scottish industry is that it is in a unique position, a better position than in 1945. There is now a competitive pound, an environment that encourages risk-taking and growth, and low borrowing rates.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0023">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
We should, therefore, send the industry a message: "Get out into the world marketplace, where sales can be achieved". Instead of biting one another and running Scotland down, we should tell Scottish industry that it is in a unique position, but that it should not deceive itself that Europe will produce an upturn in sales tomorrow. That will not happen. I say that in sorrow, not from nastiness. Unless we target growth areas, the substantial benefits that the Government have put in place will disappear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gordon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee for long, although I wish to make several points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I emphasise the importance of obtaining a settlement in the general agreement on tariffs and trade round. Every speaker has acknowledged the importance of exports to the Scottish economy. An unimportant point is that we export more per head than almost any other country on earth. We have to do that to survive. The smaller the base, the more important the ability to sell products abroad. A successful GATT settlement will present opportunities for Scottish industry. Failure to secure such a settlement will damage the Scottish economy. All hon. Members have an interest in ensuring that such a settlement is made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The domestic context of the debate is the aftermath of a Budget, which ran well as a west end show—the Chancellor of the Exchequer gave a good performance—but does not run well in the clubs and pubs or in the repeats. People are beginning to realise that the Budget sets out the biggest tax increase in British post-war history. Yet the Government were elected on a pledge to cut taxes. The taxes fall particularly unevenly in Scotland. In justifying tax increases, the Chancellor made a virtue of the fact that mortgage rates have fallen. We must bear in mind that fewer people in Scotland have mortgages than the United Kingdom average, and more people in Scotland pay rents. In the past few years, rents have not fallen—they have increased steadily, faster than the rate of inflation. The Budget has meant an even more savage cut in the spending power of people in Scotland than those in the rest of the United Kingdom. In spite of the Secretary of State's attempt to gloss it over in terms of average expenditure, the imposition of VAT on fuel charges falls harder on people in Scotland than elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have discussed the importance of small businesses. I welcome the fact that the formation of small businesses has increased in Scotland. It is disappointing that there has also been an increase in bankruptcies, which means that the net increase is nothing like as dramatic as the overall increase would suggest. I am pleased, however, that in north-east Scotland there has been a net gain in the formation of small businesses. That is not as a result of redundancies but because of a degree of dynamism within the economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have been insensitive to the impact of their proposals for statutory sick pay, which will be a burden to small businesses. The Secretary of State was wrong to say that small businesses are exempt. Every employer will have to pay the costs of statutory sick pay for the first four weeks of any illness. Most illnesses do not last for four weeks and consequently there will be a charge on businesses. Considering the vehemence with which the Government have attacked the notion of a social chapter in the European Community and the increasing social costs
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
that employers face, it is extraordinary that they should have imposed such a severe social cost upon employers at an especially difficult time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although several measures in the Budget might be genuinely welcomed by successful small businesses, they need healthy markets to survive. Just as the economy is showing signs of climbing out of recession, the Government have imposed the greatest restriction on demand in post-war history. There is a danger that that could lead to the squeezing of markets just as business confidence is rising. The Budget may yet turn out to have been ill timed and ill thought through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was accosted yesterday in the constituency of the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside by a former Conservative voter who, after asking how things were going and how the party was doing, said, "I voted Conservative at the last election and I am just beginning to assess the cost of doing so. When I heard the Budget, initially I thought it was good news, but now that I have worked it through I realise that I will pay more tax in a single year than I have ever done before. That is not the reason I voted Conservative at the last election and I certainly shan't be doing so at the next."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments advanced by the successful Conservative candidates at the general election, now the hon. Members for Aberdeen, South and Kincardine and Deeside, and by my Tory opponent and others, was that if people voted Conservative they would have a voice inside Government fighting for the people of the north-east. What we have, are voices inside Government voting for VAT on domestic fuel, voting adversely to alter the tax regime for the North Sea industry and voting to keep our fishermen in port. It is—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that his party produced a policy document in 1990 called "Costing the Earth", which stated that is was anomolous that the United Kingdom did not impose VAT on fuel and that the Liberal Democrats would impose such a levy as soon as physically possible?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can confirm that that document exists, but its contents are not as described by the hon. Gentleman. It has never been my party's policy to put VAT on fuel. I shall not pursue that matter further, as it is a subject for another debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has an understandable tendency to complain that Opposition Members are not prepared to acknowledge successes. There have been successes, especially in the north-east of Scotland, and I am pleased to welcome three that have come to public notice in the past few months. The Grampian Country Food Group is, as a result of recent acquisitions and developments, the largest processor of chicken products in the United Kingdom, with an annual turnover of £180 million and a work force of almost 2,000. That example shows that it is possible to operate a truly national company providing quality products from a base in the north-east of Scotland. That is a welcome development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the constituency of the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond), Machie Quality Farms and Foods recently opened a new ice cream plant. That company now has an annual turnover of £15 million and 218 employees-no mean feat for a farm-based business. The airport at Aberdeen recently has been extended and continues to handle additional passengers. That demonstrates the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0024">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
vitality of the economy in the north-east. However, problems do exist—in the paper industry and in the textile industry which, sadly, has disappeared from my constituency. It was disappointing and anomalous that the Gorbachevs were presented with a Crombie coat in Aberdeen. The fabric for such coats is no longer made in my constituency, as it was until very recently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the oil and gas industry is the most important in terms of size in the north-east of Scotland, employing more than 50,000 people. No one doubts that it is a major engine in the north-eastern economy. However, some underlying anxieties remain about the state of the industry. A price of $14 a barrel is insufficient to sustain the long-term forward development that the industry needs, regardless of the success of measures to reduce costs. It is unfortunate that, in this year's first Budget, the Government should have phased out the tax relief on exploration. The timing could not have been worse. The net effect of that measure is that whereas there were 63 exploration rigs operating in the first three quarters of last year, there were only 30 in the equivalent period of this year. The result is lay-offs: more than 100 engineers have been made redundant at Vetco-Gray in my constituency. Other people's future prospects in the exploration industry are also depressed, and there is even talk that some oil fields will be abandoned prematurely in the effort to cut operating costs. Without exploration, the extra resources needed to maintain forward development will not be found. Consequently, the industry's long-term viability will be compromised. That fact must be taken very seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consequences of the recession have forced customers to rationalise their operations. Many have realised that they should concentrate their operations in Aberdeen, instead of splitting them up among other locations. London has been the loser in that process. We should welcome that development, but it does not disguise the very severe constraint that has been placed on the industry, which has been aggravated by changes in the Budget. We must realise that, without exploration, the industry will not have a long-term future and will not be able to sustain a successful worldwide export market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has been made to the elections in Russia, but that country, if and when stability is achieved, will represent a very large market for oil and gas equipment. We should be able to supply that potential market from Scotland, but we shall not be able to do so without an adequate home base. The Government have not been sensitive to that. Their oil tax changes were ill timed. The industry needs a more sympathetic understanding and a clear reinforcement of the Government's determination to give it a tax regime that will provide for a viable, long-term future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend for Hamilton demolished the Government's case on two issues. The Government suggested that they wanted to be at the heart of Europe. Clearly, the Government do not want to be at the heart of anything costs them any investment. My hon. Friend emphasised that Ministers have dismissed a £15 million job package without even reading the report about it. That will be to their discredit. It will also have consequences for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For 14 years the Conservative Party has described itself as a low-tax party. That myth has been destroyed. The Conservative party is a high-tax, low-spend party. The Budget will deflate demand. Every family in Scotland will pay a possible extra £10 of their household budget towards nothing other than reducing the deficit which symbolises the Conservatives' incompetence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton also discussed the issue that I wish to tackle—the Government's failure to distinguish between the interests of the Conservative party and the interests of the country. The Government cannot distinguish between public and private interest. Is there an ethical basis in Scotland for a Government whose current crowd of Ministers and Back-Bench supporters behave in such a way? The Government have not mentioned their advisory group, the Scottish Economic Council. It is a 30-member body that advises the Secretary of State on matters that are important to industry and business in Scotland. It is a pity that in the aftermath of the Peterken fiasco and anxieties about local enterprise councils, the Secretary of State has not reviewed that council. Conservative interests are well represented on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to put on record our anxieties. Eight out of 30 members of the Scottish Economic Council represent companies that have contributed £250,000 to the Conservative party. How can such a body give objective advice? It includes representatives whom the Secretary of State has selected and who are involved with companies that have donated £250,000 to the Conservative party. I hope that, in the wind-up, we shall receive not only an apology for such a deplorable state of affairs, but an explanation of it.

Ms. Audrey Baxter of Baxter and Sons Ltd. made a donation of £5,000 to the Tory party. Mr. Ron Garrick is involved with the Weir Group plc which donated £7,500 to the Conservatives. Sir Matthew Goodwin of Hewden

Stuart plc donated £21,000 to the Conservative Party. He is also a director of Murray Ventures plc which donated £3,000. Sir John Raymond Johnstone, who, I believe, has a post with the Forestry Commission, is the director of companies which have contributed £10,500 to the Conservatives. Dr. Christopher Masters of Christian Salvesen plc gave a small donation of £22,000, not to the Conservative party, but to something much worse: the free enterprise group, British United Industrialists. A. Fraser Morrison is the managing director of Morrison Construction Group Ltd. which recently donated £5,000 to the Tories in Scotland. Sir David Nickson represents companies which have given the largest contributions to the Conservative party: £70,000 from Scottish and Newcastle Breweries plc and £53,000 from Hambros plc. Mr. Runciman, the ex-chairman of Shanks and McEwan Group plc, is involved in two companies which have contributed £35,000 to the Conservative party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a scandal that we have an economy in Scotland in which a quarter of a million people cannot find work; training places are being cut back monthly; investment is nothing like what we need to ensure that we have a skills base for the future; and manufacturing and industrial production are not recovering as they should, although the Secretary of State has advised us that we are in a recovery period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scots will want to know why, after 14 years, the Government are so arrogant and so complacent—they simply do not give a damn about what is happening in the real world—that they want to pack out their councils and advisory groups with people with a vested, narrow, private interest in what advice they give. I should like to think that when the Minister winds up, he will want to commit himself to a review of the Scottish Economic Council and assess its effectiveness. We need reassurances that such political gerrymandering of advisory bodies will cease. We know from the health boards fiasco in Glasgow and from local enterprise companies that the Government simply do not beleive in public accountability or in effective monitoring systems of how public expenditure is spent. Now the Secretary of State feels that he need not consult any person in the real world apart from the cosy clique of Conservative cronies who seem to dominate and populate every organisation in Scotland. The Opposition will not tolerate the expansion of the unelected state in Scotland and we give the Secretary of State notice that in the new year we shall be vigorously pursuing the question of the vested private interests that the Tory Government represent in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The names on the Scottish Economic Council that we have given are only those of people who work for large backers of the Tory party; that does not exclude the fact that Mr. Bill Hughes of Grampian Holdings plc is also on the council, as is Professor Donald MacKay, another Conservative appointee. The list goes on and on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In replying, the Minister should address himself to the core issue of whether Scotland is to be run with a semblance of public interest ethos. Or, will he admit that after 14 years the Government simply do not care what happens and that their failure to distinguish between Conservative party interest and that of the country will continue? That is not good enough for Scots and it is not good enough for the Opposition. We give warning that in the new year we shall return to embarrass the Government at every opportunity to ensure that they scrap their partisan approach and tackle the real needs of the Scottish economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for Fife, Central mentioned the membership of the Scottish Economic Council.

The hon. Member for Hamilton raised a more serious point when he complained that provisions in the Budget would mean an unprecedented increase in the tax burden. That is not the case. The 1993 Budget increased taxes as a percentage of gross domestic product by 1·2 to 2·3 per cent., phased in over the next three years. The Jenkins' Budget of 1968 increased the tax burden by no less than 2·1 per cent. of gross domestic product. The Gaitskell Budget was even more significant.

The hon. Member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram), raised the issue of AST. The Government are asking the European Commission to confirm that the package offered by the Irish Government was within the terms permitted aid ceilings. That matter is being followed up.

We are motivated by three main principles—to sustain the economic recovery, to keep inflation down within a target range of 1 to 4 per cent. and to restore public finances to better health and, over the medium term, towards a balance. Growth this year is expected to be higher than that predicted at the time of the March Budget and the Treasury's forecast of higher growth next year is supported by all the economic indicators, which is an encouraging sign.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as identifiable public expenditure is concerned, Scotland does well. The 1991…92 figures show that expenditure per head in Scotland was approximately £450 or 15 per cent. higher than the United Kingdom average, and £540 or 18 per cent. higher than the figure for England. Expenditure per head in Scotland is well above the United Kingdom average in every programme except social security. Of course, at this time, unemployment in Scotland is below that in England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister compares Scotland with the rest of the United Kingdom, will he consider the Chancellor of the Exchequer's announcement in the Budget that £1·25 billion is to be spent over the next three years on a new, modern apprenticeship scheme, which will be administered in England and Wales by the training and enterprise council? That is £416 million a year for the next three years. How much money will be spent on that scheme in Scotland, and will it be handled by the Scottish Enterprise network?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can tell the hon. Gentleman that £250 million will be spent on training by the enterprise companies. The detailed figures will be announced soon. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman about apprenticeships.

I share the objective of the Secretary of State for Employment to increase out competitive edge by enhancing the skills of craftsmen, technicians and supervisors. In addition, our consideration of the Howie report may lead to important changes in the structure of secondary education for 16-and 17-year-olds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) and for Hamilton asked about housing. More than £3 billion will be spent on that in the next three years. The net capital programme is up by £25 million. Local authorities' net capital programme for their own stock is up by 5.5 per cent. Scottish Homes' net provision is up by 5·8 per cent. That will provide for 740 community care places, 1,300 homelessness places, 184,000 repair units and more than 2,800 newly built units.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan asked about the property division of Scottish Enterprise. I can confirm that there is no conflict of interest. The funds raised were used to offset grant in aid over more than one year. The gross budget is now more than £1.3 billion over the next three years, which is substantial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also pay tribute to the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside about Highlands and Islands Enterprise, which will receive some £76 million-more than £200 per head of the population of the area. That will create many jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Moray asked about additionality. I can confirm that objective 1 money will be additional. The hon. Lady asked me to comment on the letter from Bruce Millan, to whom I have spoken recently on the subject. The letter raises a point different from the one I discussed. I shall make inquiries, but I can confirm that the overall allocation takes account of objective 1 status and of spending under other objectives. European Regional Development Fund grants are additional and they include objective 1 UK Government grants. If the hon. Lady sends me a copy of the letter, I shall send her a full reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, some £240 million will be brought into the higlands and islands over the next six years as a result of objective 1 funding. Negotiations with the Commission are taking place and, as soon as they are completed and project eligibility is agreed, we shall be able to start the process of selecting projects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Under-Secretary and I shall continue my correspondence on that matter with him. I seek clarification on the issue of hill livestock compensatory allowances because there should be no deductions whatsoever from the objective 1 structural funds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am well aware that objective 1 funds are additional. I shall check the point that the hon. Lady raised and write to her as soon as possible. I also confirm that eligible projects will include ferries, roads, bridges, development sites for industry, waste disposal and energy networks. One encouraging project, which has been supported recently by Highlands and Islands Enterprise, is a project to establish wave power on a commercial basis. I hope that project and many others will show Scotland leading the way in applied research and technology.

The hon. Member for Kirkcaldy raised the issue of "Setting Forth". The aims of "Setting Forth" are to secure and enhance accessibility to the north of the Forth and to improve the service on the road network to the west of Edinburgh. Everything the hon. Gentleman said was diametrically opposed to what the leader of his regional council had said to me repeatedly. There is a strong difference of opinion between the hon. Gentleman and his regional councillors on that subject. However, I can confirm that no decision on whether to proceed will be taken until the results of the feasibility studies are available at about the turn of the year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. Is it in order for the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley to have twice disrupted the Committee on points of order and to have raised questions about time being available for hon.Members to speak when he has flitted in and out of the Committee—[hon. Members: "He is here."] He has flitted in and out of the Committee without listening to the debate, although I acknowledge that he has recently returned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no truth in the rumour that the hon. Gentleman has crossed the Floor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall follow the normal statutory procedures, which, of course, could provide for a public inquiry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>rose in his place and claimed to move,</i> That the Question be now put.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the Question be now put:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee proceeded to a Division.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) called "No" when the Question was put, but voted "Aye". His vote must follow his voice. I shall record the hon. Gentleman as a "No".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
