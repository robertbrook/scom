<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Last Saturday, some of my colleagues and I went to the Eastwood constituency of one of the Ministers here to hear people's opinions of what the Minister was saying.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. What happened at Eastwood on Saturday has nothing to do with the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. Would it be in order if I were to present the Minister with a letter from his constituents? Surely there must be some procedure relating to that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman puts me in an awkward position. His point has nothing to do with me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McAllion <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. A report in the press at the weekend referred to members of the Committee. The leader of Eastwood district council—who is a Tory—referred to the Minister, who is his Member of Parliament, as, "an arrogant bastard". Would it be appropriate to use that phrase in Parliament?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do not want to hear such language in the Committee.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Sir Hector Monro)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am always grateful to you, Mr. Martin, for giving the correct ruling on points of order. I am sure that you would wish to deprecate the continual abuse of Committee procedure by Opposition

Members, who rise to make what they know are bogus points of order. The hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) must know that nearly every point of order that he has raised has been bogus and intended only to get publicity. He has been shot down nearly every time by the Chairman, so he has been out of order. You, Mr. Martin, have acted correctly—Opposition Members have abused the Standing Orders of the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is for the Chairman to decide.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall not give way now.<br><br>
As the hon. Member for Hamilton said on Thursday evening, there were 210 water authorities and 234 sewerage authorities at the end of the war. The Water (Scotland) Act 1967 established the 13 water boards and the Central Scotland Water Development Board. The Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 reduced that number by creating the nine regional water authorities and the three island councils in addition to the Central Scotland Water Development Board. If the Bill is passed, we shall have a new, single-tier authority, the creation of 30 or more councils and the disappearance of others. Change is, therefore, essential—doing nothing is not an alternative.<br><br>
The Government's policy—set out in the White Paper—is to deliver the best and most cost-effective water and sewerage services possible. To meet the standards that we want in the United Kingdom, the large number of European Union directives on matters such as cleaning up beaches and preventing the discharge of sewage sludge into the sea after 1998 and to bring the standard of water delivery and sewage removal up to that required in the next century, we shall have to make capital expenditure of about £5 billion over the next 15 years—I think that that is generally accepted—and create a more efficient structure.<br><br>
Costs have risen rapidly under local authority control. In the five-year period from 1989–90 to 1994–95, taking an extrapolation for the community charge period, the average band D household water bill has increased from £32.50 to £67.01—an increase of 106 per cent. Sewerage charges, again abstracted for the different forms of costing, have increased by 54.2 per cent. Those figures were provided this year by the Centre of Regulated Industries.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For comparative purposes, could the Minister give us the figures for the increases that have occurred in England and Wales since the privatisation of services there?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I can. In England and Wales, water charges have increased by 58 per cent. in contrast with 106 per cent. in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Since privatisation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The figures for the past five years are all set out in the CRI paper.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1536</span>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall get on with my speech. It is only fair to other members of the Committee to have some continuity in Ministers' and hon. Members' speeches. The constant popping up and down by hon. Members has been getting out of hand. I propose to make my speech as relevant as possible to the debate.<br><br>
The important question now is how best to achieve investment and to restrain running costs, which will inevitably increase under any structure. We sent out a consultation document and listened carefully to the responses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government paid no attention at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That just shows that the hon. Gentleman—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty <span class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I have made it quite clear that I shall not give way.<br><br>
We listed a number of options in the consultation document and, of course, all Opposition Members jumped to the conclusion that we would go down the privatisation route. I have given an absolutely firm commitment—and I do so again—that that is not our policy. Furthermore the hon. Gentleman should know that we would need further legislation if we were ever to complete it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot make it much plainer than that. We are not privatising water. We considered options such as franchising and variations of local government control, but we decided that the most efficient and effective method would be to use a public authority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way on that particular point?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall not give way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is supposed to be a debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister is not giving way. He has the same right as any other member of the Committee—he is entitled to be heard.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. The Minister said that hon. Members were popping up and down, which is an insult to you, Mr. Martin—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is trying to bring the Chairman into his argument, which he should not do. The Minister has said that he is not giving way: that is his right. The Minister has a right to be heard, like any other member of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. The Committee has been going for a number of weeks now

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1537</span>
and, on every occasion, Ministers have given way to sensible questions and answered them. Surely that is not impossible for this Minister, or is he entirely incapable of dealing with questions?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not a matter for me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should give way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is causing a disturbance. I am reluctant to suspend him, but I want order in the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Is it in order for the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley to play to the television cameras?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that it is disappointing when hon. Members cannot behave in line with the rules of the House. I shall give way when necessary. I have only just began my speech and there is plenty of time to go. The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley should realise that the debate goes on after my speech. He can make his speech then, and I shall answer it. He has got into a state of excessive impatience. Just cool down.<br><br>
After careful consultation and having listened to the answers, we decided to go for a form of public authority to manage water and sewerage in Scotland. We made that clear in the July White Paper. We have decided to implement the most efficient and effective system. We knocked the Opposition off their perch because they thought that the only thing that we were going to do was privatise. Since they found that that was not the case, they have still, quite unnecessarily, trumpeted around Scotland the idea that we are going to privatise. It is quite wrong to misinform the people of Scotland when a statement in a Government White Paper made our intentions absolutely clear. It is disappointing to have seen in a newspaper a very nice lady at a Labour party rally holding up a Labour party pamphlet that said, "stop water privatisation", when we are not privatising water. The Opposition just do not seem to understand the truth when they hear and see it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Last weekend, a huge number of the Eastwood electorate signed a letter that said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We deeply resent being told by you"—</p></blockquote>
the Minister, the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart)—
<br><blockquote><p>"and the Prime Minister that we did not understand the question that was being asked or that we were misled by propaganda. The overwhelming vote shows that people knew and understood your proposals for water and that we did not want them."</p></blockquote>
Only two people out of the hundreds who were approached in the heart of Tory Eastwood refused to sign that letter with its clear message, so the Minister should not misrepresent the clear view of the people as endorsed by the leader of Eastwood district council. The people knew what they were voting for, and the Minister must recognise that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood is well able to look after his constituents and himself. As the hon. Member for Hamilton knows, I have not criticised the wording of the referendum paper, but
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1538</span>
I have criticised Labour party attacks on privatisation because that is not what we are doing. If the hon. Gentleman has a conscience, it must have been wincing a bit during the past week or two.<br><br>
Today, I am advocating publicly owned water authorities, as set out in the Bill. The hon. Member for Hamilton, who was such an enthusiastic supporter of quangos in the 1970s, ought to think twice about his behaviour in the Committee in the past week or two.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way on that point?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, if only to have peace and quiet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For the fire brigade we have got Strathclyde fire and for the police we have Strathclyde police. Although I do not like joint boards, they do at least have some advantages in that there are directly elected councillors on them. The Minister said that he looked at the various options. Why did he not consider Strathclyde water? It has been working well, as has Strathclyde sewerage, so why did the Minister not consider keeping it as a joint board in line with the fire services and the police?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal in some depth with joint boards in a few minutes' time and I shall explain then exactly why I think Opposition Members' arguments on the matter are somewhat convoluted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. The Minister is referring to the original consultation process and saying that the Government responded to it. Will he accept, and admit in the Committee, that 64 per cent. of all the people who wrote back said that they wanted public, local authorities to have control of water and sewerage? How can the Minister say that he took account of their view when he is obviously ignoring it and setting up quangos to which he or his colleagues will appoint board members?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The vast majority of the responses to the consultation paper were against privatistion and we have left the water authorities firmly under public control. The hon. Gentleman must realise as well as I do that they are not under private control.<br><br>
We are proposing to set up three water authorities in Scotland, which will be relatively small and effective boards of seven to 11 members plus the chief executive, all appointed, of course, by the Secretary of State. [HON. MEMBERS: "Of course."] If I did not say so, Opposition Members would be up to their feet asking why not.<br><br>
The authorities will be democratically accountable to Parliament. Men and women of a blend of expertise, with knowledge of the water industry and of business, will be members of the boards.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh <span class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.<br><br>
I am quite certain that local authorities, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, the Consumer Council,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0853">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1539</span>
industry, the National Farmers Union for Scotland and the public will make recommendations to the Secretary of State as to who should serve on the authorities.<br><br>
There will be plenty of opportunity for the people of Scotland to put names forward to the Secretary of State for appointment to the boards. I shall be very surprised indeed if local authority members, who have expertise and knowledge of the water industry, are not on those boards.<br><br>
The three authorities will be responsible for water and sewerage and for the appointment of staff. I believe that the vast majority of the staff currently employed by local authorities throughout Scotland will transfer to the new authorities.<br><br>
The authorities will be monitored by three customer councils with direct access to the Secretary of State and a real involvement in the charging process. Those councils will have the sole duty of representing the interests of the consumer. That does not happen at present—no body has a direct responsibility to represent the consumer.<br><br>
New clauses 42 and 54, which set out the codes of practice, the rural involvement of the water authorities and their role in recreation and the arts, are designed to ensure that those interests are carefully looked after by the water authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for giving way—it was late in coming, but I appreciate it.<br><br>
The Minister has dismissed Strathclyde as a gigantic monster. How then can he justify the creation of three even more gigantic water boards? How can he justify dismissing the views of half the population in Scotland—and 97 per cent. in Strathclyde—who have said that they do not want anything to do with quangos? Does not democracy matter any more?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is comparing chalk with cheese. He is miles from the point, and I shall come to the involvement of joint boards in a few minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Kynoch <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has mentioned customer councils and the interests of the consumer. Can he assure people in rural areas that there will be no prejudice against them when it comes to costing?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. We have tabled an amendment to that very effect. Rural interests must be looked after. That point was highlighted for us by the Consumer Council, to which we listened carefully.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson <span class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: That council is chaired by the wife of a Tory candidate for the European Parliament. How can the Minister expect us to take customer councils seriously when people such as John Corrie, a former Tory Member of Parliament and now the chairman of the Transport Users Consultative Committee for Scotland, are always being appointed to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1540</span>
them? How can he describe that as consumer representation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman never can make anything other than a niggling point. Is he suggesting that Mrs. Hatton is not an experienced and perfectly adequate chairman of the Scottish Consumer Council? [HON. MEMBERS: "And a Tory."] There is nothing wrong with that. There are many good Conservatives here and they are perfectly adequate people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was always so—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not always so—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The background noise must cease. The Minister is entitled to be heard. I repeat that he is a member of the Committee and is entitled to a hearing as other hon. Gentlemen have been given one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) said that it was always so, but hon. Members should think back—I know that the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) can—to the appointment of the original health board authorities, in which I was involved after taking the relevant Bill through the House. Who were the first two chairmen of the largest health board in Scotland? Two well-known socialists, Mrs. Nealon and Sir Simpson Stevenson.<br><br>
The other important issue is the appointment of regional committees by the customers councils. They will be able to keep a close eye, at grass roots level, on water authorities. The myths of privatisation and disconnection can be dispelled by the establishment of authorities most fitted to provide water and sewerage at reasonable cost.<br><br>
Opposition Members want to have the water authorities under local authority control. What has happened to new clause 20, which was on the amendment paper for some time before being removed, is an interesting mystery. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) has a different view on the islands councils and on recommendations for appointments to water authorities by local authorities. The Scottish National party wants 12 water authorities plus the ability to heed recommendations from local authorities so that members need not all be councillors.<br><br>
There is, therefore, a split in the Opposition parties but, effectively, their amendments boil down to joint boards. It is interesting that, in the consultative period, only Tayside, Fife, Borders and Central supported the concept of joint boards. There has been a remarkable U-turn since the debate on part I, when for 25 or more sittings we heard joint boards being criticised out of hand by the Opposition, who said that they were hopeless organisations and difficult to finance and that it was impossible to organise their membership and work out their capital expenditure. Why the U-turn and the current enthusiasm for a joint board?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that the use of Loch Katrine, for example, as a water source for central Scotland, stretching all the way from the Lothians' to Strathclyde, shows that local authorities worked out arrangements that were practical for large services? In this case, Central's sensible submission reflected that history.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0854">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1541</span>
The Government's proposal for joint boards for personal services causes trepidation in the minds of the public, who fear that they may not receive those services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They certainly will get those services. Great care has been taken in the geographical spread the hon. Gentleman has examined, particularly regarding the Central Scotland water development board.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood <span class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is being characteristically unfair when he represents the opposition to the Government's plans as being fragmented. If he were able to say that the Government are prepared to concede joint committees or joint boards to administer the water and sewerage systems, that would receive—as far as I am aware—a very warm welcome in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I note what the hon. Gentleman has said. Opposition Members were vilifying joint boards. The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) on 24 February said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The central criticism that many people have about joint boards is that they weaken local democracy and make local government in Scotland less rather than more accountable."</p></blockquote>
In the same debate, the hon. Gentleman also said:
<br><blockquote><p>"People will not know which council on a joint board will be responsible for the services in their area. If one lives in Dundee, will Dundee council be responsible? It may say, 'It is not us, but the joint board'. Which joint board will be responsible? Will its members from Perth and Kinross or from Dundee be responsible? That will lead to serious confusion and local democracy will become far less accountable."—[<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 24 February 1994; <i>c.</i> 644–8.]</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the problems that I raised is to leave the regional councils in charge as water authorities, which is the democratic way to handle the whole affair, and to throw the Bill into the bin, where it belongs. That is what the people of Scotland want.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been explaining in detail how there will be democratically run water authorities. The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley said—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How can they be democratic?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because they will be democratically responsible to the Secretary of State in Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. The Minister said that they would be democratically accountable water boards. How can that possibly be?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not a matter for me. It is up to the Minister to explain.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) must have been sound asleep for the past half hour. I have been carefully explaining how the water authorities will be responsible to the Secretary of State, who is responsible to Parliament, and all hon. Members have access to the Secretary of State.<br><br>
I tend to think of the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley as the member for CCD which, in farming, as he knows, stands for cattle control
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1542</span>
documents, which usually relate to taking fat cattle to the slaughterhouse. The hon. Gentleman said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Where is the accountability with joint boards? People will pass the buck from one authority to another. There will be no clear arrangements for democratic accountability. That is the third reason for not having joint boards.".—[<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 24 February 1994; <i>c.</i> 653.]</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. I quite enjoyed his joke, but I am strange in that way.<br><br>
The Minister says that we are critical of joint boards. We are. We should much prefer all such services to be responsible to a directly elected authority, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East said. But surely even the Minister can understand that we should prefer joint boards whose members come from the directly elected authorities in the area—albeit a number of different authorities—to quangos that are nominated by a Secretary of State who has no mandate and no authority in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for East Lothian was equally critical. I shall not read all of his comments, but shall simply quote the last one:
<br><blockquote><p>"Joint boards are not the right way to deliver important services in Scotland."—[<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 24 February 1994; c.659.]</p></blockquote>
Opposition Members have done quite a remarkable U-turn.<br><br>
The SNP made some astonishing statements on the delivery of water services. I refer especially to the article in <i>The Scotsman</i> last year by the hon. Member for Angus, East which stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"Sabotage could mean everything from turning off a tap to blowing a pipe right up: when we threaten we will deliver".</p></blockquote>
That is disgraceful language for any Member of Parliament, encouraging incitement or even terrorists.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is pathetic stuff. The greatest sabotage is what the Minister is doing to democracy and the fraud that he is inflicting on the Scottish people with this unwanted measure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I now come to the important issue of public expenditure. Local authorities—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may ask the Minister a rather careful question. If control of the new water authorities is other than through democratically elected representatives, what machinery will be in place to ensure that the capital programmes for infrastructure for new developments ensure that local priorities are met? That is a rather difficult issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is very simple: not just the water authority, but the customers council can keep a close eye on the correct distribution of capital expenditure. Regional committees will be established on top of that. It is far less likely that anybody would be left out under that system that under current local authority control.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend find it interesting that the Opposition, who are opposed

to the proposed structure, were responsible for the Highlands and Islands development board and the Scottish Development Agency which had a massive impact on planning decisions in Scotland because of the importance of locating funds, buildings and property in the areas in which they were most needed? If they supported that, what do they find wrong with applying it to the provision of water and sewerage services?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I was involved in considering the legislation that set up those bodies, particularly the Highlands and Islands board, as it then was and which has run under roughly the same structure since it was introduced by a Labour Government. I do not know why the hon. Member for Hamilton, who was then pursuing his quango interest, so opposes what we want to do now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is keen to throw out smears. I was a member of some Government bodies at that time, such as the SDA board, the Scottish tourist board and the Police Advisory Board for Scotland, but I served on those boards and committees with a wide range of people, including many Conservative councillors, who were appointed because the boards had balance. The Government have so discredited the system of appointed boards that there is no confidence in them. Criticism of the customers council and the way in which the quangos are being set up comes from friends of the Government, such as the Scottish Landowners Federation, as well as from the electors of Strathclyde who voted last week.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is stretching the point a bit far. The criticisms of the Scottish Landowners Federation are about way-leaves through agricultural land and are nothing like the hon. Gentleman's overall opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon. Gentleman can make his speech later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Good, and I shall reply to it.<br><br>
Local authorities' capital expenditure on water and sewerage services is presently about £230 million to £240 million a year. It is practically all financed from borrowing from the public works loan board, with section 94 consent. That is public expenditure, which adds to the public sector borrowing requirement. The new water authorities will have access to the national loans fund probably for broadly similar amounts, although exact figures will depend on each year's public expenditure survey settlement. That, too, will be public expenditure and will add to the PSBR.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman did not know that—his computer must have gone on the blink. Investment must increase by about £ 100 million a year over the next 10 to 15 years to meet the European Community directives. Constraint on public
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1544</span>
expenditure is necessary not only in the wider interests of the economy but of the inflation rate, which must continue to be controlled.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a crucial point. There is no difference between hon. Members on the Committee on the fact that extra capital will be required. Why on earth cannot the new water authorities be left in the hands of joint boards or committees that are given powers of access to borrow money from the public purse and from the private sector? What is the difficulty in giving local authorities power to let them borrow money in the capital markets?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The borrowing that they undertake currently is very high and goes against the PSBR. We are trying to constrain that and it is part of the reason for giving them the opportunity to use the private finance initiative and finance from revenue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not. I want to get on. The hon. Gentleman may intervene later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister is not giving way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Financing capital from revenue will mean increased charges. That is inevitable under whatever system we use. The right balance on how far it is right and prudent to build up debt for future generations of charge payers must be achieved. Use of the private finance initiative will involve the private sector investing in and contracting with the water authority for the service investment delivered. That is an entirely sensible approach.<br><br>
Such an approach has been encouraged by Opposition Members. The Labour party recently published a document entitled "Financing Infrastructure Investment—Promoting a Partnership between Public and Private Finance". The hon. Member for Hamilton was quoted in the Dundee <i>Courier and Advertiser</i> when he spoke about the possibility of creating
<br><blockquote><p>"extra public investment by freeing up the possibility of extra private capital. It's a practical way of boosting up public investment when public money is short."</p></blockquote>
That is exactly the line that we are taking. I am amazed that the hon. Gentleman is trying to find a way to oppose that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister makes a fair point at last. I agree that, perhaps, private finance is necessary to achieve the investment that the water and sewerage industry needs. Why does it need three quangos to do that? It could be done just as well by the 12 authorities that we propose. There is no reason, other than a completely bureaucratic one, why the public sector should not raise money in the private market to serve the public good. Why does the Secretary of State need to appoint three quangos to raise the money rather than use public

agencies, which are publicly responsible to the electorate through locally elected councils?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have explained several times that the proposed public water authorities will be responsible to the Secretary of State and, therefore, democratically accountable to the country. They will be made up of extremely able people such as local authority members, engineers and business men. They will run the water authorities in Scotland extremely effectively. [<i>Interruption.</i>] When Opposition Members do not get their own way, they behave as they are doing now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The word "democracy" keeps coming up. Reference has been made to the Secretary of State as the linchpin or the cipher for that democracy. How can anyone have confidence in that arrangement when the Minister responsible for the Bill ignored 41,650 people in his own constituency who said no to the proposal for water boards?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do not want to return to that argument. I want to get on so that other hon. Members may speak.<br><br>
The shadow Chancellor, the hon. Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown) recently made a speech entitled "Individual Potential". He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"To achieve the best and not just the basic public services, we must modernise and transform our social and economic fabric by creating new partnerships between public and private sectors."</p></blockquote>
There is no doubt that the Labour Members have moved a long way towards accepting the financial proposals in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I must finish so that other hon. Members may speak.<br><br>
Opposition Members have put much weight behind COSLA's £2 proposal. They all skated round their financial proposals when moving amendments. COSLA misled the Committee when it said that its proposal could be financed by £2 a year from each household. If £100 million is borrowed at 8 per cent. and that figure is spread over domestic water and sewerage service consumers and industry, COSLA calculated that the cost would be £4 million for domestic consumers and that there would be 2 million households. It calculated that, therefore, the cost would be £2 per household. The fatal flaw, however, is that £100 million has to be borrowed year after year. The increase in charges is cumulative and debt would have to be repaid at £2 in the first year, but at £4 in the second and at £6 in the third. Later, £50 or £70 repayment charges would be reached. The COSLA figure is misleading, particularly if COSLA's objective is borne in mind.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood), quite fairly raised the issue of the islands councils. I received representations from them and was pleased to meet in London a delegation of councillors and those involved in the delivery of water and sewage treatment services.<br><br>
Two main issues are involved; the first could be overcome, though that would mean a major change in legislation because two parallel authorities would have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1546</span>
to be established: the islands councils and a water and sewerage authority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because I am telling you—[<i>Interruption.</i>] The Bill is necessary to do that and to change it would be extremely complicated.<br><br>
Secondly, and most importantly, despite what the islands councils say, the cost of going it alone would be great—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Once again, there is a terrible amount of background noise, which is not at all helpful to the Committee. Also, the large piece of cardboard must be removed from the Committee's view.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Where would you like it put, Mr. Martin?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would not want to tell the hon. Gentleman where I would like it put. Could we have some quiet?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The more important issue mentioned by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, who is speaking on behalf of his hon. Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) and the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald), was the costs of going it alone. They would be great and an unfair burden on the islanders.<br><br>
I hope that it will be possible to move rapidly to uniform pricing within the three authorities, which would be a tremendous advantage to the islands councils. If those councils decided to go it alone, the costs would at least double in the Western Isles and increase by more than £100 per household in Orkney and Shetland. That would be a tremendous penalty for the islanders to pay.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in that point of view. The 46 amendments in my name adequately cope with the legislative problems. They are not technically deficient in any respect, so no main legislative change is necessary. Would the Minister help me to consider the matter further by setting out the cost assumptions that he is throwing around? I do not know that they would be agreed by the local authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course, one would want to help the hon. Gentleman, but I am not throwing around cost assumptions. I have made a plain statement that costs would probably double in the Western Isles and perhaps increase by £100 per household in Orkney and Shetland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman examined the costings and obtained details from the local authorities he would appreciate the projected costs of the three councils for water and sewerage services. I am trying to help the hon. Gentleman, not be difficult. He should examine the figures and realise that the Government are trying to do the best for the islanders. If they are part of the northern water authority and progress is made towards even pricing throughout each authority, they will be substantially better off. That must be to the advantage of the councils.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I may be doing the Minister an injustice, but I understood after speaking on the telephone to Edward Thomason, the Shetlands convenor, that one of the complaints was that there had been no serious discussions between the Scottish Office and the Shetland islands council. Is that the case?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had a detailed meeting here in London with delegations representing all three islands councils. There is no question of not having had discussions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When?</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The meeting was held about three weeks ago. We went into the matter in the greatest detail. I shall be responding to Mr. Thomson, who is an excellent convenor and for whom I have the highest regard. There is no question of disagreement on the issue.<br><br>
I am arguing that the islanders will be considerably better off financially under the new water authorities. That will be of benefit to them, and is not something to be criticised. In response to the concern that senior staff from the islands might be lost, let me say that I hope that many who are currently employed will retain their jobs.<br><br>
We have explained clearly that we believe the three water authorities to be the right way forward. Safeguards suggested by the customer councils and regional committees have been built in, and our amendments will ensure that rural areas, in particular, are looked after. As I believe that the Government's programme is correct, I will not accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What we have heard so far has been an absolute disgrace. The Minister cannot hide the plain fact that he is taking control of water services out of the hands of democratically elected, accountable local authorities and handing it over to three giant, unelected, unaccountable quangos. That is disgraceful, and unacceptable to the people of Scotland.<br><br>
The Minister has shown his arrogance towards the Scottish people. He has given every sign of being the Marie Antoinette of the Tory party. He will get his come-uppance in May and June, and it will be nothing more than the Govenment deserve.<br><br>
The Government's proposal is a fraud and a theft. It is a fraud because the Government have no mandate whatever to carry out their proposals. It is a theft, because water and sewage treatment facilities are publicly owned assets, paid for not by central Government but by generations of local government taxpayers. It is their assets which the Government are procuring for the unelected quangos.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way with his customary courtesy. Did he not hear the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley say that in his view, this democratically elected Government have no mandate in Scotland? Does the hon. Member for Angus, East agree with me, therefore, that the hon. Member for Carrick Cumnock and Doon Valley should join the Scottish National party?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1548</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps every Scot should join the SNP, but I will not indulge the Minister in sideshows, when the reality is that his policies are completely unacceptable in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is saying that it is unacceptable to create water boards. He also said in <i>The Scotsman</i> on 9 March 1993:
<br><blockquote><p>"Sabotage could mean everything from turning off a tap to blowing a pipe right up: when we threaten we will deliver".</p></blockquote>
Is that acceptable?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that that is absolute nonsense. He knows the reality. This is an attempt to divert us from the central points. The Government are bankrupt in that they have no mandate. I know exactly what I said and where I stand on this issue. I have made my stance plain to the hon. Gentleman, who does not seem to understand the English language. My actions, beliefs and life-style should make it plain.<br><br>
Why is the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson) denying democracy? The Scottish people gave his party no electoral mandate at the general election. He has seen from the Strathclyde referendum that there is no mandate for the Government's actions. Why are the Government denying the Scottish people's fundamental right to policies that we believe in and want carried out by bringing in five English Conservative Members to bulldoze the measure through. The democratic voice of 1.2 million people in Strathclyde is to be nullified with the help of five English Tories. At the end of the debate there will be a 12 to 11 vote. The procedure that has been carried out 57 times so far will be repeated. That is the death of Scottish democracy. The hon. Gentleman should be ashamed of what his party is doing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Labour party would agree with the hon. Gentleman that the Strathclyde referendum makes it clear that the Government have no mandate in Scotland for their actions relating to water. I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on likening the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) to Marie Antoinette. We can never forget that she said, "Let them eat cake." The Minister's words were, "Because I am telling you." They will go down in history as the phrase that typified the arrogance of this Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is the day when all pretence of democracy and representation for the Scottish people died. It will happen again at the end of the debate, by 12 votes to 11. That is how the Government operate. The supposedly listening Government are certainly not that. The Government can certainly claim to have a United Kingdom mandate, but I remind them that the matter is a purely Scottish one, affecting only Scotland. The Government have absolutely no Scottish mandate for the undertaking.<br><br>
In the past few months I have been in television studios with representatives of the Labour and Liberal parties, but no Conservative Member has turned up to justify the measure. There has always been an empty chair. I should have been happy if any Tory Member—or even the doorman at Tory party headquarters—had turned up to justify the policy, but nobody did. I had hoped that this morning the Minister would justify this disgraceful policy.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0858">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1549</span>
I was disappointed. I have heard no real justification for destroying the present system, which the Scottish people want and which has provided high quality services and could continue to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Given the comments that the hon. Gentleman has made about being justly grieved at the absence of any Conservative Member at any of the panels that he has attended, I suggest that no Conservative Member was asked to take part in them. I assure the hon. Gentleman that whenever I have had such an opportunity I have taken it up. I am sure that that goes for my hon. Friends.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Given the Government spokesmen, it might have been better if the hon. Gentleman had turned up. He has cast a slur on the television companies which fairly invite all parties. If Conservatives do not turn up it is a pretty good indication that they do not believe in their policy and cannot defend it publicly.<br><br>
Before the end of the debate, I should like the Government to justify the boards and the boundaries that have been decided upon. We were not told that. I do not believe that the justification is in the costs. The COSLA figures show that the £5 billion required for modernisation and for compliance with European health regulations would amount to a half penny per person per day—a burden that the Scottish people would happily bear to retain the existing, accountable, local government-run water services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman obviously was not listening to my hon. Friend the Minister, who clearly pointed out that COSLA's figures had neglected the fact that the £100 million was required every year and that the financing cost would multiply repeatedly. Will the hon. Gentleman face facts and pass them on to the Scottish people instead of engaging in ridiculous scaremongering?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The fact is that the situation has been created by the Government. Treasury rules have been designed by the Government, who are following through with their own mistake. I did not hear the Minister make a promise of a green dowry to the quangos or, more importantly and better still, to Scottish local authorities. When water was privatised in England, £700 million of Scottish taxpayers' money was used. I have not heard of any similar dowry in this instance. Perhaps the Minister is to offer it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the facilities remain in public control, there is no need.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a need to give Scotland the same deal that was given to England. If £700 million of green dowry were applied, it would transform the financial situation. I do not accept what the Government are saying. I would like to see the COSLA experts sitting round the table in a much more open fashion with these matters being fully discussed to get to the truth. The Minister claims that the country areas have no need to worry. "Trust me, my dear", he says. No one should trust the Government given their record. I certainly do not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman agree that the real reason why the Government propose this model
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1550</span>
is because it is the first step down the road to privatisation? They want to establish a structure that can have a financial pattern and record that will then be viable for selling off at the next stage. That is the only reason why they are doing it in this way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a hefty suspicion shared by the majority of Scottish people. By creating the quangos the Government are taking the same first step that they took in England and Wales before they privatised. Why should we trust the Government? There is no reason to do so. There is no need for the move to quangos. The people do not want them. They want to keep the present effective, high quality local government service. There is no reason, apart from sheer dogma, why the Scottish people should not have their wish fulfilled. That is a matter for all of us, as citizens in Scotland, at future elections. The Government will get all that they deserve then.<br><br>
Scottish authorities are more cost effective now than the English privatised companies, in terms of cost per unit of water delivered. Local government provides high quality local services that the Government's proposals will destroy. They will certainly take such matters out of local hands. The Minister was quick to shrug off interventions when asked about the cost of privatised water in England. He should look at the figures for Dwr Cymru—Welsh Water—which has charges that are double those in Scotland and is about to increase them even further.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman elucidate how much increase in capital expenditure that company took on after it was set up?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It paid for capital expenditure by raising prices. That would not happen under Scottish local authorities. The capital expenditure would be undertaken in a much more sensible, long-term and better planned way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Member give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must make progress. If the hon. Gentleman does not understand local government financing and how it should be done, he should take some lessons. He should contact COSLA and other Scottish local authorities to find out how water should be run. Other hon. Members wish to contribute and I want to make progress.<br><br>
The proposed north of Scotland water authority is a geographical monster; it stretches from Perthshire to Shetland, Orkney and the Western Isles. It will automatically mean higher charges for the majority of customers because of the disparity in current pricing and the low population in most of the area. The west of Scotland authority will be a very different organisation from that giant because it will have a smaller number of advanced treatment works serving mainly urban populations. The north of Scotland water authority, by contrast, will have a large number of small low tech treatment plants. In Highland region alone there will be 157 plants, serving a rural population. How can those authorities be compared in terms of the cost and efficiency they deliver to their customers?<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0859">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1551</span>
Our amendments would solve that problem as well as maintaining democracy in the control of Scotland's water. Local authorities could continue to deliver water services if they were allowed to invest and if they were freed from the Government's self-imposed capital restraints. They could do so through the many sources, both private and public, available to them. Treasury rules are Government-created restraints. They are not immutable or irreversable facts of life. There is no justification for the proposals in terms of cost or the Government's failure to deliver to their own boards the green dowry that they have happily given to England using Scottish taxpayers' money. Similar treatment for our local authorities would eliminate the need for the boards and boundaries and the system proposed in the amendments would ensure even higher standards of service.<br><br>
There is no justification for the proposals in terms of the Government's own stated objective of decentralisation. The opposite is being achieved. The Bill will give central Government greater centralised powers. The Secretary of State creates the three quangos. He sets their boundaries. He chooses their chairmen, vice-chairmen and members. They are simply his creatures, meeting behind closed doors without public scrutiny, accountability, or electoral mandate. The Minister has the cheek to call that board democratic. He proposes one public meeting a year. My amendment seeks to make all its meetings public. The press and the public would be allowed to attend and minutes would be available. That would be a much more democratic set-up that the one public meeting a year that he proposes. Far too many quangos have already been imposed on Scotland by the Government.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
The quangos will be made up of seven to 11 place men and women plus a chief executive. They will be hand picked by the Secretary of State to replace publicly elected regional and island councillors. The Minister has a cheek to describe that as more democratic. This daily essential service is one that no one can avoid using. It is a monopoly service. Under his system it will be run by two or three central Government hand-picked football teams. That is the opposite of democracy and it is a quite disgraceful system to impose.<br><br>
I cannot understand how the Government can say that Strathclyde is a monster that is far too big and bureaucratic yet seriously propose the giant water boards for Scotland. The Government's proposals are the opposite of democracy. The Government had no mandate, either at the last general election or the Strathclyde referendum. Their proposals have been completely rejected by the Scottish people. It will be a sham of democracy when the wishes of 1.2 million people in Strathclyde are overturned by five English Tories on the Committee when we vote in a Division.<br><br>
A Government who are lumbered with the Barnett formula and their own dogma are now headed on a two-stage journey to water privatisation. The Bill lets them privatise in two sips rather than one gulp. It is how they did it in England and Wales, and I have no doubt that that is how it will be justified at some future date in Scotland. The truth is that we are seeing one Government
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1552</span>
mistake feeding on another in a sequence that has inevitably led them to the policy. Their incompetence allied to their dogma lies at the heart of their mistaken and unwanted policy. The amendments offer an alternative to the quangos. They meet the wishes of the Scottish people who want good quality, local government water services offered to them democratically by their local councils. The public in Scotland do not want the Government's changes.<br><br>
There is no need for this theft of public assets. The alternative to the three giant quangos is a regional system with no disruption of buildings, staff or the present system. There would be no new costs. That system offers joint boards, which the Government have said they favour. It offers good planning units and continuity. The solution is obvious to everyone but the Government.<br><br>
Today is a celebration of the union between Scotland and England. A measure totally unwanted by Scotland is being foisted upon us by an in-built English Tory majority. Scottish public opinion is not only being flouted, it is being brutally and deliberately ground into the dust. There can be no kidology in trying to explain away that 97 per cent. vote by suggesting that the people did not know what they were voting for. They knew exactly what they were voting for.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says people knew what they were voting for. Did he know what he was voting for when he and his 10 SNP colleagues voted in the House 15 years ago last night to bring Mrs. Thatcher to power?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I knew exactly what I was voting for. It was to avoid a situation like this. The former Member for Islington, North, Mr. Cunningham, has been asking us to table sensible amendments. He was Mr. 40 per cent. If that requirement had not been introduced he would not have needed to be here because we would have had some form of Scottish Government back home.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Linlithgow has behaved extremely honourably in Committee and has brought much of the Government's hypocrisy to light. He also understands what is happening today—as we all shall when the Committee votes by 12 to 11 to force through the measure against the wishes of the Scottish people. This is a celebration of the Union, but the reality of the Union is that 1.2 million people in Strathclyde and, I am sure, an equivalent number elsewhere in Scotland are having their views disregarded by the Government. The Bill is being put through the Committee by hon. Members who have not one ounce of mandate in Scotland. This is a day of shame and powerlessness for Scotland. It is the ultimate reality of unionism, which no amount of journeys and petitions to No. 10 Downing Street will hide.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: While addressing the issue of water and sewerage authorities, we should have some water in the Committee Room to quench the heat from the Opposition. They are burning the heaps of mythological rubbish that they keep hurling at the Government's intentions for the change.<br><br>
The starting point is that the Government are changing local government in Scotland to single-tier structures. On that basis, it is natural and responsible to examine the way that water and sewerage services will be provided in future.<br><br>

The hon. Member for Angus, East spoke about a Scottish Assembly and about democracy and various referendums and ballots. I remind him that only 33 per cent. of people in Scotland wanted a Scottish Assembly in 1979. That means that he would have gone against the wishes of the majority in imposing such an assembly on them. He should take some lessons in democracy on that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A majority of Scots voted yes to that proposal. Would the hon. Gentleman and his party, should 33 per cent. of the electorate vote for them, refuse to form a Government? In a previous election, they polled 44 per cent. That did not stop them. I remind the hon. Gentleman that Winston Churchill said that a majority of one is enough. He and his hon. Friends are proving that by voting 12 to 11 against the wishes of the vast majority of the Scottish people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a difference of opinion about how Conservative votes on such issues are counted. Bearing in mind that Opposition Members and I support the philosophy of the Union Parliament, I can understand why the view of the hon. Member for Angus, East differs from mine.<br><br>
When considering the matter, we must return to the consultation paper issued by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. He presented eight options, ranging from unitary authorities to a national authority or board; from joint boards, which were considered, to full-blown privatisation. All aspects were considered.<br><br>
Without a doubt, it was widely thought that the Government's preferred option was privatisation. There was merit in that, because it would have taken away the responsibility for funding water and sewerage from the public purse and brought Scotland into line with procedure south of the border. That is important, bearing in mind the way in which funds are allocated advantageously to Scotland at present and the way that the funds are distributed across a range of services, such as health, roads and social services. The funds come from the overall Scottish budget, which is generous compared to that for south of the border. We have the additional burden of funding water and sewerage and it is right that the matter should be examined.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend rightly drew attention to the fact that water is no longer included in the Barnett formula. There is no element south of the border, so we cannot have a percentage of nowt.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right, as usual.<br><br>
The Secretary of State has recognised public opinion. Consultation was carried out and privatisation, even though it may have been the Government's preferred option, has been thrown out of the window.<br><br>
Strathclyde's referendum re-emphasised the public's feeling that privatisation is not wanted, whether Opposition Members like it or not, they campaigned and encouraged the view that privatisation was the idea behind the Government's plans for the restructuring of the water industry. That played a major part in the result obtained in the referendum. I shall say more about that later.<br><br>
In considering the consultation period, I wish to refer to my submission. At that time, I stressed that it was
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1554</span>
important that the democratic wish should be recognised. Although that wish suggested that there should be no privatisation, the representations made to me gave me the firm belief that the democratic wish in Scotland is for single-tier local government to be established. That is the line that the Government are taking and those two forces must be brought together.<br><br>
The Government's responsibility is to ensure that a quality water service is obtained at the lowest possible cost. That must be their objective.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is everybody's objective and it is being delivered at the moment. However, I have a simple question. If eight joints boards are good enough for the police and the fire services in Scotland, why are similar joint boards unacceptable for the delivery of water and sewerage services?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I discount the hon. Gentleman's view that we currently have the ideal provision of water and sewerage services. I shall demonstrate how my constituency is not well served by the present arrangements.<br><br>
On the issue of joint boards, we must consider the structure that the Secretary of State seeks. We must consider engineering and technical requirements. They suggest that water services in particular—sewerage is slightly different—should be treated in large blocks. That is reasonable. It is the way forward on engineering and technical grounds. Given that, and what may be 30 or more local authorities in Scotland, the creation of joint boards for water services would be difficult. The position would differ considerably from that of police and fire services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that Opposition Members continue the argument about joint boards for police and fire services but they do not accept that those services differ because they do not have to undertake major, but necessary, capital expenditure of £5 billion? That sum will have to be spent on water and sewerage services in the next 10 to 15 years. Therefore, the joint boards for police and fire services are totally irrelevant to this debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the point about investment, my hon. Friend is absolutely correct. I have heard cries of "Why?" There is another aspect to the issue. We are looking to three boards to manage water and sewerage in Scotland. That is in line with the submissions that I made in the consultation period. I am not changing my view.<br><br>
The Secretary of State is already committed to maintaining police forces, police areas of responsibility and fire services in their original areas. That will increase their numbers, which suggests the potential for maintaining the involvement of the joint boards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may like to tell Opposition Members that police and fire services do not carry separate taxation at local level. Therefore, there would be huge political pressure on the subject of the future funding of local water boards. The Opposition could be faced with politically unacceptable levels of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0861">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1555</span>
taxation. It is essential that this matter should be addressed in a way that is acceptable to the SDA and the Highlands and Islands development board because certain funding arrangements might produce a political backlash.</span></p>
<p>11.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with much of what my hon. Friend has said, and I thank him for his intervention.<br><br>
I return to the starting point—that the status quo is not an option in the local government reorganisation. [HON. MEMBERS: "Why?"] I have already explained. We are changing from having 50 to 60 local authorities, 12 regional authorities and X number of district authorities. The whole structure of local government is changing. [<i>Interruption.</i>] Because people wanted it. I imagine that the hon. Member for East Lothian stood upon that issue at the election, when he no doubt supported his party on single-tier local authorities. Now that he has no responsibility for government and little say in Scotland's affairs, he has changed his tune and is backing off from single-tier local authorities. We are not backing off: we will deliver. I believe that people in Scotland will be grateful for that in time to come.<br><br>
As we look further forward, we must consider other aspects. I have mentioned the Scottish budget implications. It is fundamental that the new organisations can, without going through public sector borrowing channels, attract cash to the investment programmes that are needed in this area.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon McMaster <span class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will give way to the hon. Member for Paisley, South (Mr. McMaster).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman accept that to say that water services are being reorganised because of local government reform is a circular argument? We firmly believe that the reorganisation of water is a building block for privatisation. There is an easy way out of the problem—scrap the whole Bill, not just the provisions on water. If the hon. Gentleman had any political bottle—excuse the pun—he would argue for that to happen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman, given his shape, is an expert on circular arguments. I say that in the nicest possible way, because I admire him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will see the hon. Gentleman outside.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman allow me to answer to his hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South? It is only courteous, after all. He suggests that we abandon the Bill. I have just extolled the virtues of single-tier local government in Scotland. I stood upon the issue at the general election, and won my seat because of my arguments for single-tier local authorities.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1556</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Just.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley says, I only just won my seat I won it against all expectations, however, including the forecast of the hon. Gentleman, who consistently believes that we will lose to his party and that one day there will be a Labour Government. I will leave the hon. Gentleman to his world of dreams—he is entitled to it.<br><br>
When I make a promise, I try to deliver. I promised my electorate that the Government's re-election would result in single-tier authorities. The Government were re-elected and have proposed single-tier authorities. That means the reorganisation of water and sewerage services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will give way to the hon. Member for Fife, Central, who attempted to intervene earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I give the hon. Gentleman credit for showing more courage than his hon. Friend the Minister in taking interventions on matters of detail. I have a simple question for the hon. Gentleman. He now appreciates that the constraints on the PSBR will apply to the 12 authorities that we propose and to the Government's super quangos. What is the significant financial benefit of operating three super quangos, in comparison with 12 authorities?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Given that the make-up of the authorities as currently envisaged—and I shall deal with the points about that make-up shortly—will no doubt place emphasis on expertise in engineering and financial management, and all the other advantages appropriate to a body that will manage water and sewerage services, those bodies will be able to attract private finance at a lower interest rate than would be possible through public sector borrowing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, other hon. Members also want to contribute. The hon. Member for Fife, Central asked for an answer and I have given one. He and his hon. Friends will no doubt make their own comments in speeches, but I have presented what I consider to be the facts. Other opinions may be expressed and I always respect people's rights to differ, but I believe that hon. Members are wrong if they do not recognise the fact that, with the expertise on the relevant committees, the potential of the new bodies would be greater than that of purely local authority organisations.<br><br>
With regard to the consultation, my original recommendation was that the water system should remain in public ownership. I recommended the establishment of three or four boards that would take on responsibility and be accorded the powers to dispose of assets within the structures that were offered to them, but only so as to realise finance to be ploughed back into the infrastructure and the facilities that they would be managing. Another suggestion in the consultation paper was for the new boards to have powers to attract private sector finance other than through public sector borrowing.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0862">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1557</span>
I believe that that arrangement has been established. I commend my hon. Friend for that.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Angus, East suggested earlier, with regard to structures, that the matter should be left to local authorities, which would not pass cost on to the consumer. <i>Hansard</i> will prove that the hon. Gentleman said that. How, then, will the provision be funded? Will it be through unlimited borrowing? Opposition Members always seem to proffer that answer. Would the additional cost be covered by higher taxation? We are told that Opposition Members no longer believe in higher taxation, so would that cost be passed on through local authorities, by means of the council tax or other methods? If the hon. Gentleman considered present conditions, he would see that local authorities have consistently raised the cost of water and sewage treatment service provision in recent times. That process would continue. I argued in my consultation submission that an easy way out for Government in relation to further financing of capital and sewerage services would be to leave local authorities to take the stick for the higher rate of increase in those costs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The investment has to be made. Local authorities can and do accomplish that more effectively and give good value for money. Local authorities are subject to restrictions and rules, such as the Barnett formula, Treasury rules and capital consent. They have been constrained by Government policies that have led to not just unfairness, but inefficiency, and pay out more every year in interest than in providing services. There is a need for fundamental reform in the way that local authorities are financed so that they can continue to give good value for money, rather than a quango that meets behind closed doors and is not accountable to anybody.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The board to which the hon. Gentleman refers will be responsible to the Secretary of State who, as the Under-Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries has emphasised already, is democratically responsible to the people of Scotland.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman's claims about financing are wrong. Local authorities have repeatedly received allocations consent for expenditure on sewerage and water services. They constantly carp about the limitations imposed on them, but they never take on direct financial responsibility. They always point the finger, as the hon. Gentleman has just done, at my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State who, as they see it, sits above them and limits their actions. He will not be able to do that now and will be obliged to take responsibility for the boards reporting to him. It is about time, because the people of Scotland deserve the best possible water and sewerage services. That will add to Scotland's future economic standing as those services are important to individuals living in Scotland and to essential industries such as tourism.<br><br>
Over the years a shambles has been created of the Ayrshire beaches. The sewerage authority—Strathclyde regional council—did not use the cash made available to it by my predecessor as Member of Parliament for Ayr, now my noble Friend, Lord Younger, and because of the council's lack of investment we have ended up with beaches—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1558</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman can make a speech soon. I am replying to the hon. Member for Angus, East. The sooner that the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley realises that he has nothing to do with Ayr, the better.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is not giving way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am getting signals that I have spoken for long enough and so I shall attempt to wind up. Before I do so, I want to discuss the amendments. Amendments Nos. 553 and 265 reflect the desire to maintain the status quo and would provide for 12 local authority service areas. Given the changes that will be required to co-ordinate needs, the three-authority structure is correct for mainland Scotland.<br><br>
I have some sympathy for amendment No. 503, tabled by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire who seems to recognise that there is logic in the mainland authority structure, but suggests that the islands are a different matter. I, too, recognise that difference in terms of the technicalities and of engineering. Therefore, a small change could be acceptable in this area, but I shall take guidance from my hon. Friend the Minister on that.<br><br>
Although my hon. Friend the Minister recognised the importance of the consultation process and did not go all the way to full privatisation of the water authorities, it would be churlish not to take some recognition of the referendum that was held recently in Strathclyde. I do not believe that the referendum got it right, but there was an element of a message that we should perhaps recognise a little.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
As I understand the current proposals, there is potential for local authority representation on the new water boards. There would be some merit in that. However, let us suppose that my hon. Friends consider adopting that approach. Givern the criteria placed on the boards in relation to attracting finance for the development and maintenance of the schemes, there should not be a dominance of local authority representatives on the boards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way on that point?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, the hon. Gentleman can make his own speech. I am about to wind up on the issue.<br><br>
I commend the overall direction of my hon. Friend's proposals and he will receive my support. However, I should like some indication that there will be local authority representatives in the new structures. That is extremely important.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment It is worth setting out what it is designed to do, together with the accompanying amendments. First, the purpose is to retain the provision of water and sewerage services in the hands of the 12 newly constructed joint boards based on the existing local authorities. Secondly, it is to ensure—as a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0863">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1559</span>
point of policy in which we, unlike the Government, believe—that those boards will comprise entirely of elected councillors. Thirdly, the Bill should include the key provision, which we shall discuss later, that there will be no disconnections in the system as it affects domestic consumers.<br><br>
It has been an interesting debate—we heard a quite pathetic contribution from the Minister. We have had a pathetic but predictable week of performances, from the Prime Minister through to the Minister of State at the Scottish Office, the Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary of State. We had hoped that today cognisance would have been taken of the 1.2 million voices in Strathclyde who rejected the nonsense. We had thought that a case would have been made for the dramatic changes on which the Government intend to embark. But we had none of that. We heard a pathetic defence of the proposals that did not answer any of the key questions, especially on finance. Moreover, we were given the most amazing revelation that the nonsense was the brainchild of the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie). That perhaps illustrates why the part of the Bill dealing with water services is such a fiasco. If the hon. Member for Ayr has such influence on the Front Bench, let us hope that the next referendum will be a separate one in Ayr constituency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At no time did I suggest that the proposal was my brainchild. I said that my consultation was along similar lines. That is a matter of public record and was clearly established before the proposals were issued. Moreover, the referendum that I shall happily accept will be that of the next general election when I shall accept the verdict of the constituents in Ayr.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is too modest. Why should not he be behind the crazy proposals? Why should not he take responsibility? No Minister is taking responsibility; there have been no serious speeches. The Prime Minister was badly briefed. There was an expensive and not especially interesting stunt. In Committee today—after the whole of Scotland's expectations had been built up to hope that the Government might be listening—the Minister, at a stroke, demolished those expectations. That is sad, for two reasons. The first is that it shows a Government beyond democracy. Is not that an alarming prospect? After 15 years, we have a Government who are simply beyond democracy. They do not care.<br><br>
We visited Eastwood on Saturday. The Minister may smirk, show scorn and laugh, but he may not have a smile on his face in future. He should listen to the people whom he represents. They are bitterly angry not only about the issues, but about the way in which hypocrisy, contempt and authoritarianism have been heaped upon them. That is sad for democracy.<br><br>
The Government have no case. The proposals are a cobbled up political idea. The Minister always tries to assuage our fears by saying that privatisation is not on the agenda, but nobody believes him. Why should we? It is important that we tackle the myths behind the Government's case for water and sewerage reorganisation. The first myth is that the Government have been misunderstood. It is pathetic that the Government believe that the Strathclyde electorate all failed the test because they did not answer yes.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1560</span>
The Tories also argue that the electorate thought that the referendum was about privatisation. The electors of Eastwood did not think that it was about privatisation. They knew that it was about three super quangos. They had read about the crisis on the Glasgow health board and have no stomach for the quangos that the Government will establish.<br><br>
The Government have suggested that we have spoken about privatisation to create a fear factor, but we should consider what happened in England and Wales. In 1984, the then Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Mr. Neil Macfarlane, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We have absolutely no intention of privatising the water industry. The Government have no plans to urge that upon the water authorities."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 19 December 1984; Vol. 70, <i>c.</i> 457.]</p></blockquote>
What a surprise that two years later the then Secretary of State for the Environment, the right hon. Member for Mole Valley (Mr. Baker), said:
<br><blockquote><p>"In the last six years we have made the water authorities fit and ready to join the private sector … Privatisation is the next logical step. It will bring benefits to the customers, to the industry itself and to the nation as a whole".—[<i>Official Report,</i> 5 February 1986; Vol. 91, <i>c.</i> 288.]</p></blockquote>
That is our fear. People do not trust the Tories or anything that they say. If Conservatives do not believe Labour Members or the people of Strathclyde, they will go to the polls at the regional and European elections and they will suffer. Let them be under no illusion that, at the next election, water will be firmly on the agenda of all the Opposition parties. The Conservatives may run and run, but sometimes they cannot hide.<br><br>
The statements that I have quoted describing the English experience sum up the true position. Let us not have any nonsense from the Tories about them being misunderstood. Scots are intelligent, caring and concerned electors. If the Government ignore their wishes, they will do so at their peril.<br><br>
In a weekend speech in Stranraer, the Secretary of State for Scotland said that the new authorities would be more accountable. I do not know whether the Secretary of State has taken leave of his senses, but on 28 March <i>The Scotsman</i> reports his words. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Under the new authorities, he claimed, consumers would have more say.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>'I am sure that the new water and sewerage customers' councils will be very effective in holding the new authorities to account for their activities.'."</p></blockquote>
Are we to believe the corollary of that, which is that councils and councillors are ineffective, inefficient and doing a bad job? The Secretary of State's comment is nothing less than a slur on the activities of councillors over the past two to three decades. The Opposition appreciate what has happened to water and sewerage activities. That is why we have argued coherently for 12 water authorities to carry on doing their job.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson) said that we have to change the system because of the reorganisation of local government. That is logical. One cannot have 30 water authorities. However, there will be 30 police authorities, 30 fire authorities, eight joint police boards and eight joint fire boards, which will be based on existing structures. If that is the case for those vital life and death services, what is so different about sewerage and water services? That is our case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The difference is the massive borrowing that will be essential to put in place the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0864">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1561</span>
infrastructure necessary to meet modern requirements. That is not the case with the police and fire services—there would be no political fallout whether that action were or were not taken. Either way, there will be fallout about water and sewerage, which is an important reason for realising that there is a massive difference.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Tayside, North makes an important point about finance, which is one of the myths that I want to tackle in a moment.<br><br>
The Committee is agreed on the third issue: if the crazy reorganisation goes ahead, each unitary council cannot be a water authority. There is no doubt about that, but there is a genuine perception that the Government have not answered the fundamental question of why the delivery of water and sewerage services, the structures— [<i>Interruption.</i>]<br><br>
I shall deal with the points made by the hon. Member for Tayside, North in a moment.<br><br>
We have not been told why the services cannot be provided in the same way as the police and fire services. We believe that our elected councillors are capable of dealing with the life and death issues of the police and fire services, but the Government state that they do not have confidence in them to run the water and sewerage services. I reject such inferences. The logic is with us and the Government have yet to deal with that point.<br><br>
The fourth issue that I want to stress involves quangos. Conservative Members have attacked us for suggesting that the 12 new water authorities should be joint boards. We do not like joint boards and have a passionate belief in the efficacy of elected authorities carrying out services on behalf of the electors who elect them. We in Scotland are proud to have such excellence of services, but that is not the issue.<br><br>
The issue is this: faced with three super-quangos and three place chairmen or place chairwomen on salaries of perhaps £50,000 or £60,000, the idiotic situation in England and Wales is being replicated. The benefits to England and Wales of using quangos or the private sector have been referred to, but it is astonishing that the investment record in capital expenditure of the much-maligned local authorities in Scotland is exactly the same as that of the English and Welsh local authorities since their inception in 1989.<br><br>
Capital expenditure in England and Wales has increased by 84 per cent. In Scotland, the increase is 80 per cent. over the same period. Where is the investment gap? Where is the problem?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way in a moment.<br><br>
Where is the investment gap? While capital expenditure in 1991–92 and 1992–93 increased by 6 per cent. dividend payments increased by 94 per cent.<br><br>
We should not have to listen to the nonsense about the super-efficiency, sound value for money and sound handling of money in England and Wales. It is a myth. There is little parallel there between consumer charges, profit levels and capital investment. The Government should remember what has happened there before they take the next step into the market place, which will be full privatisation.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is, of course, failing to address the fact that there is dissatisfaction, as expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr and by me, because of the problems in large rural constituencies, where inadequate sewerage facilities prevent houses from being built. The hon. Gentleman's time scale is not that envisaged for the borrowing requirement.<br><br>
The borrowing requirement in England and Wales will continue to increase, year on year. That is what will happen in Scotland. The question is how it will be funded.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Tayside, North will be pleased to know that I am about to discuss the final myth, which is that such a massive upheaval is needed to invite investment into the system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Tayside, North has repeated the myth that the hon. Member for Ayr perpetrated. It should be exploded. He said that Ayr had been underfunded for water and sewerage by Strathclyde. The Ayr division has 14 per cent. of Strathclyde's population and 25 per cent. of the investment. It has—rightly—done well under Strathclyde. The myth that it has not should be exploded.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We seem to have some problem with the windows and with the Minister speaking aloud as he receives his private briefing. It is quite distracting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am listening all the time.</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the Minister is back on track.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley makes an excellent point. Amid the drivel that we have heard this morning—I cannot think of a better word to describe the nonsense that Conservative Members have come out with—have been myths about particular constituencies throughout Scotland. We are angry that senior Strathclyde officials, councillors and everyone else working for the council, are constantly rubbished by people who do not understand what is going on and do not care what attacks they make on professionals and councillors who have given decades of their life to the service.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman dare to ask his hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley about the period over which the investment has been made? I acknowledge that there has been a change of heart in recent times, but Strathclyde region has had responsibility for the provision of this service for 15 years. The hon. Gentleman should find out what the level of investment has been over that period.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that you, Mr. Martin, would not want me to ask my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley that question.<br><br>
I have a general point that the hon. Member for Ayr has also raised. This Tory Government have been in power for 15 years. All of a sudden, they are attacking the local authorities for not doing this or that. But what have the Government been doing for 15 years? Did they simply
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0865">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1563</span>
decide three or four years ago to increase the amount of capital consent because they knew that Europe would be passing directives on waste and water issues. Or, as is more likely, did the Government want the industry to be fattened up so that when privatisation takes place, what is on offer will be the same as it was in England and Wales—a debt write-off, a dowry of special tax privileges and a bonanza at the taxpayers' expense? Ultimately, the private sector paid £3.5 billion for assets worth £33 billion. That was absolutely disgraceful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I put to my hon. Friend a question on an issue of fact? He referred to the rubbishing of Strathclyde. A senior superintendent of the Motherwell area authority, who has worked for Strathclyde for 20 years and admires what it has done, asked me whether any Minister has spent a day looking at its operation, of which Conservative Members are so critical. Have they actually been to see the Strathclyde operation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an eloquent point.<br><br>
The key to the Strathclyde hate campaign lies with the Prime Minister. His remarks at the Conservative party conference set the tone for the Bill and for the Conservative party's hatchet job. It is disgraceful that the Prime Minister should describe Strathclyde as a monstrosity and say that it will disappear. My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow should not be surprised at the comments of Conservative Members.<br><br>
The fifth myth is that the restructuring is all about winning investment. It is clear from all the Government documentation prepared in the Scottish Office that local authorities are doing an excellent job. Of course, challenges lie ahead. The figure of £5 billion has been thrown around. I am grateful to the Minister for reducing that, on a year-by-year basis, to the true figure of £100 million. Of the £5 billion mentioned, £3.5 billion is already committed over the next 15 years, leaving £1.5 billion.<br><br>
COSLA is right that borrowing can be obtained. There is no great secrecy about how it works at present—the public works loan board is involved. Conservative Members will know that the debt from that will be transferred to the national loan fund. There is also private market borrowing. That is no great surprise, but perhaps the point is lost on some Conservative Members. It is always important, too, to make a distinction between water and sewerage services, because every penny that is spent on water comes from the consumer. There is no leakage there. It does not cost the Treasury a penny. It is a borrowing requirement line on a piece of paper.<br><br>
Funding for sewerage is more complex. We have already heard that when the present system is changed to that of the three super water quangos, it will still be necessary to work within the constraints of the public sector borrowing requirement.<br><br>
The question for the Government is how public expenditure will be affected. How is the wonderful investment in education and social work to be released? The idea is nonsense. Nobody believes it. It is economic illiteracy, which the Government are trying to project into policy. It cannot be right, because whether a super quango of Tory placemen or women or the 12 authorities are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1564</span>
responsible, they will be subject to the constraints of the PSBR and the market place.<br><br>
I invite the Government to offer to the joint boards everything that is being offered to the super quangos. What would be the difference, apart from the Government's pathological hatred for local democracy and elected councillors?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether my hon. Friend realises that under the joint board system there would be no revenue support grant support for the sewerage services which are provided at the moment through local authorities. The charges would be entirely passed to the user and therefore there would be an increase to the consumer in that respect. That is one way in which the boards will burden the user with increased costs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valid point which clearly illustrates that the Conservative Members have not thought through the consequences. They have been sold a political pup, which they must nurture and care for. They are unconcerned about the facts concerning the financial structure of the new boards and are unwilling to admit that the PSBR constraints do not move an inch.<br><br>
The Conservatives have been talking about franchises, contractual arrangements, private sector partnerships and investment by the private sector generally. Why cannot those arrangements apply to the 12 water authorities? Do the Conservatives believe that a constraint exists? What I have described is now happening. Some of the most innovative projects in Europe are being funded by the Public Works Loan Board, private markets and the European investment bank. Governments cannot get away with such utter nonsense as the argument that a massive upheaval is necessary to ensure the required investment.<br><br>
The case is simply put: the Government have no case. They have failed to explain what they are about. We have heard a pathetic defence of their stance. In the light of the misunderstanding, the issue of accountability, local government reorganisation, quangos versus elected councils and the question of investment, it is clear that the Government are deluding themselves into thinking that they can pursue a political point—to their extinction as a party—without being rumbled by the public. What happened in Strathclyde last week was about the first bite of the cherry for the Scottish people. If the Tories do not listen, they will be wiped out in the regional and European elections—and deservedly so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have never been deluded and I am certainly not deluded now. I have no qualms at all. When I considered how we arrived at our arrangements for funding and management of our water and sewerage services for the next 15 to 20 years, it became clear to me that unpopular decisions would have to be taken about pricing levels for the service to the consumer. That unpopular aspect of the matter prompted me to address the subject in a way that my party's Front Bench did not accept. I realise that my proposals on the consultation were not those that the Government agreed on. My hon. Friend the Minister has brought forward a package that is designed to meet many of my concerns. It is particularly relevant to the question of whether the operation should be run by joint boards or based on the historical
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0866">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1565</span>
precedents of the SDA and the Highlands and Islands development board. That lies behind the Government's thinking. Unpopular decisions will have to be taken. As I said earlier, they will be unpopular for two reasons: first because of the cost of funding the borrowing and secondly where they do not carry out what the local people believe is essential.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. I heard his earlier intervention which was based on a false premise. In the case of the SDA and the Highlands and Islands development board were not powers given down from Government to a more local body? In this case power is being taken from local elected authorities and handed up to an unelected body.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall answer the question, do not worry. I do not believe myths and fairy tales. The SDA was set up by a Labour Government and the Highlands and Islands development board was proposed by a Labour Government because they realised that the people running them had to be directly accountable to the Secretary of State. The public sector borrowing requirement that funded those boards had to be directly controlled by the Secretary of State. That is why they were set up as they were. All the other peripheral arguments are interesting but they are not the reason why the boards were so structured.<br><br>
I am and always have been opposed to quangos in principle. I therefore do not find it easy to stand up today to say that this proposal seems the best option in the circumstances. If the Government are not prepared, for political reasons, to accept the consequences of straightforward privatisation proposals, that is the judgment that has been made. As with all judgments mine could be wrong or it could be right. That is not what matters. The decision has been taken.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I respect the hon. Gentleman's judgment and his honesty about his position. Does not he feel that although he has not got what he wants—which is privatisation—it would be easier to move to that from the three joint boards than from the 12 authorities with directly elected councillors that we propose? He is therefore one step towards his objective.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is one myth that I have no problem in destroying. It would require primary legislation to do either. In a practical political world primary legislation must go through a Committee stage. There is therefore no question that either of those options is the same. A Bill must be brought forward and taken through Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I did not explain myself fully. I was thinking in terms not of the legislative process but of public opinion. In terms of public opinion it would have been impossible for the Government to go ahead with privatisation in one gulp, as the hon. Member for Angus, East said. Now there is a staging post, however, does not the hon. Gentleman think that if, heaven forbid, a Tory Government were elected at the next election he might even be one of the Ministers and it would be much easier in terms of public opinion to go ahead with privatisation? Does he not accept that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the thought that the next Government will be a Conservative Government. I also
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1566</span>
welcome the thought that the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley will again be disappointed and will not be sitting on the Treasury Bench. His likelihood of sitting on that Bench is about the same as mine, whatever the outcome of the election. I am not ducking the issue. It is as politically acceptable to do it in one bite as in two. If one believes that there is a down side to having convictions—there always is—one must be convinced that one's political aspirations can best be achieved by a straight approach to what one really believes in. If one does that, one has the opportunity of selling one's beliefs on the doorstep.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
I have tried throughout the time that I have been in public life never to duck issues. If I believe sincerely in something, I say so publicly and clearly. I do not have to think back on what I said during the long debates with the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley on the Falklands campaign. During those many hours of debate over 14 consecutive Sundays on Radio Clyde and Radio Tay I never once deviated or changed my position. The hon. Gentleman will realise that in the Chamber last night I expressed the same views on deterrence as in those debates with him. I feel exactly the same about the logic for privatisation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Given the massive investment, it might well have been to my hon. Friend's advantage regarding future moves towards privatisation if water had been left totally in the hands of local authorities because they would not be able to raise cash as cheaply through other sources as it can be raised through the public sector borrowing channels. On that basis, the cost of water provision would have gone up and the ire of the public would have turned against the local authorities that, perhaps, welcomed privatisation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: An aspect of the package is that one is faced with various borrowing terms and conditions which vary depending on the state of the market at any given time. Anyone who has attempted to borrow in the marketplace understands that. There will be opportunities—I shall not say that there will always be opportunities because that would fly in the face of experience and of reality—under the Government's proposed structures to meet the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr. I have always been a realist when it comes to borrowing money: I am reluctant to borrow under any circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that he is a realist. Why, then, have the English water companies that have already been privatised failed so signally to get money from the private market and raised most of their money from increased prices on the services that they sell?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman had any experience of managing and running private sector operations, he would know that the most effective and efficient way to do anything is to charge the consumer the price that the consumer will pay. The hon. Gentleman may look incredulously at me, but I have experience of the marketplace and the price of a product is what the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0867">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1567</span>
consumer is prepared to pay. Every product will meet consumer resistance on price. Withoug studying the matter in detail, I do not know what are or are likely to be the effects on the English water authorities of consumer resistance. Therefore, I shall not comment on a matter that I have not studied in depth, particularly when it relates to finance. I understand finance and know something about funding. I have some experience of the marketplace.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I catch the echo from my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South that it appears that the hon. Member for Tayside, North knows nothing about local government finance. Is not he aware that because of the vast amount of capital borrowing that local authorities must do, Scottish local authorities have the most efficient and cost-effective system, because of the lowest interest loan charges of any institution borrowing such amounts of money? There is no question that the boards could compete with local authorities in the market. That is the reality of public finance, which is well documented in the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his helpful intervention. I understand the public sector borrowing requirement very well and the share of the economic cake as it is distributed throughout the United Kingdom. The share in the public sector and the share in the private sector influence the borrowing levels throughout the whole sector and there is no way in which the two can be divorced. The hon. Gentleman is an economist and he knows better than I do that public sector borrowing and private sector borrowing cannot be taken in isolation. The two must be considered together. I understand that the public sector has too big a share of the nation's borrowing. It distorts the marketplace. If the hon. Gentleman does not understand that, he is a funny economist.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roger Knapman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stroud)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. friend accept that under Labour party policy, the £27 billion required by the water companies to comply with EC regulations would come from public sector borrowing, with possibly £8 billion or £10 billion for Scotland? Is all that public sector borrowing fair to succeeding generations?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, it is not. That is the key to borrowing in the public sector. There is no such thing as free borrowing—it is deferred taxation. That is what my hon. Friend meant about fairness to succeeding generations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way in a moment, as the hon. Gentleman helps my case no end.<br><br>
The point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Knapman) is critical to the debate. The £27,000 million must be paid back. It is always easy to borrow but it is gey difficult to pay back, and even more difficult if it is left for our children and our children's children to pay back. Opposition Members do not understand that when they talk about local authority borrowing, national Government borrowing and the PSBR.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1568</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It appears that we are getting a debate going in the Committee. Does not the hon. Gentleman realise that the boards will not take any of the borrowing from the PSBR? The boards will be borrowing only £5 billion in total, so they will be less able to get good terms than local authorities who carry expenditure for roads, education and other capital costs? The boards will be less able to affect the market, and will probably pay more for the debt.<br><br>
It is not a question of putting the debt onto taxation, because water washes its face—it is a self-financing service. When rate support grant is removed from the costs of sewerage, it will become a self-financing service. It is a matter not of taxation but of the consumer paying. We believe that the consumer will pay more, not less under the scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, the hon. Gentleman has helped my case and I thank him very much. I understand the point completely. I have said consistently that if costs are transferred to the consumer, he meets the industry's future needs directly at the point of consumption. I have made my views on borrowing clear. Such views make for difficult political decisions. The structure proposed by the Government is the only viable one within public sector borrowing constraints. The fact is that we must have a structure. I have no hesitation in saying that I will support the clause because the structure that is being put in place is not that of privatisation, contrary to what Opposition Members are saying. It will bring the public sector borrowing requirement more under control and is self-financing, as the hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) said. I have no qualms about the clause and am prepared to go round Scotland saying so when I want new facilities in Aberfeldy, Blair Atholl and Burrelton.<br><br>
I could go on and on because I represent a rural constituency where there is a need for sewage facilities which are grossly under-supplied. They must be provided in a time scale that is acceptable to me because my constituency depends vitally on tourism, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr pointed out. Unless those sewage facilities can be provided immediately or in the short term, they must be paid for from the prices that are being charged today. If the hon. Member for Falkirk, East has a good memory, he will recall that I said that I had no objection to the fact that Marks and Spencer does not always charge the lowest prices in the High street; it provides the best services and goods. A problem with putting councillors on joint boards is that they would be concerned with political matters and that could have a downside effect on supply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that, to satisfy the important requirements for his constituency, the organisations proposed by the Government will be able to draw on a far wider area of expertise to run the authorities than would be possible by restricting selection to elected councillors? It is possible that councillors will be able to become members of the boards, but we want the best possible expertise to ensure that our rural areas are provided at the least possible cost with the highest possible quality of service.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is exactly right, which is why I believe that the proposals in the Bill will meet
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0868">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1569</span>
the requirement to have the services of the best possible people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to my neighbour.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman believe that the specific local needs that he mentioned can be met by the giant northern water board which is dealt with by 11 people? Will it be any more sensitive or provide a better local service than the response that Meigle hospital had from another quango based in Tayside called the health board? Does be believe that local sensitivities will be met by creating a giant northern water board that stretches all the way to Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles yet is run by only 11 people?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman tempts me, because he knows that I do not care for quangos and am opposed to setting them up in principle. I always try to find avenues that will not allow that to happen but when I am faced with a choice or options or lesser evils, I must search for one that I believe will best suit my constituents in the circumstances that I have described. I understand the hon. Gentleman's point and I welcome his support for Meigle hospital, but in considering how we in north Tayside can fund the sewage facilities that we desperately need, I am in favour of a structure that ensures that consumers pay a realistic price. That is the big difference between police and fire authorities. We have the means for charging consumers directly for services, which is lacking in the other joint boards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like me, the hon. Gentleman represents a large rural area, but he seemed to agree with his hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch) on the point raised by his hon. Friend the Member for Ayr that those boards of 11 men and women should provide expertise in engineering, finance and so on. As a business man, does not he agree, however, that there will be directors of finance, of water and of sewerage to provide the expertise? The board is there to provide democratic accountability. That is why democratically elected councillors should be on them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The board is there to provide the input and expertise. I shall explain board structures.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley should realise that the function of a board as a legal entity is to take responsibility for the activities of its organisation. People with a breadth of experience should serve on boards, covering the vital areas. The executive directors of any board are those who work at the job full time and are accountable to it.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
The real responsibility in a board lies largely with the people who have to ensure that it makes balanced, well-judged decisions. I do not believe that local authority elections necessarily produce such results.<br><br>
I am dealing with the problem of how to fund. For example, I have always argued that council house rents
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1570</span>
should be realistic, but my experience of the way that councillors have failed to address the need to bring in sufficient cash flow to meet the expense of running the operation of housing budgets has made me jaundiced in my view about the likely political outcome in that area. That is why I do not subscribe to the fashionable view that, just because councillors or, for that matter, Members of Parliament, are elected they have wisdom. My experience of life tells me that that is not necessarily the case.<br><br>
I congratulate my hon. Friend the Minister for producing a package that I did not think could be produced. I will have no problem in supporting the proposals, though they do not meet my aspirations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask just one question.<br><br>
The Minister criticised the COSLA estimate of £2 as the sum of the annual increase in the domestic water charges. Can he suggest how much the charges will increase under the new authorities to fund the extra £5 billion of capital expenditure? If he can answer, I will be grateful. I am prepared to give way to the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is not for the hon. Gentleman to invite Ministers to address the Committee. The hon. Gentleman is either making a speech or not making a speech. Has he finished?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that there was an agreement that we would share television time. That is the contribution, because other members of the Committee—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. No comment should be made about the facilities in the Committee Room.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are in the middle of a fascinating debate. Those who read the report of our proceedings will agree with that. We are fortunate that members of the Committee have such a wide range of views about the future of Scotland's water and sewerage services. My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North wants to privatise them and the hon. Member for Angus, East wants to blow them up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point or order, Mr. Martin. A specific accusation has been made against me. It is simply not true. Is it in order for the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South to make such a remark?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. A point of order is being made. It is difficult to hear the hon. Gentleman while other conversations are going on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A specific statement has been made, using the privilege of this House, accusing me of wanting to blow something up. That has never been the case. Is it in order for an hon. Member to make such a statement, which he knows to be a lie? Should that conduct be allowed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We do not want to use the word "lie", which is unparliamentary. The hon.

The hon. Gentleman is reported in <i>The Scotsman</i> of 9 March 1993, from which I quote directly, as saying
<br><blockquote><p>"Sabotage could mean everything, from turning a tap off to blowing a pipe right up … When we threaten, we will deliver".</p></blockquote>
If the hon. Member for Angus, East did not say that, surely he should resort to legal process and take the newspaper to court.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no requirement for the hon. Member for Angus, East to do that. I take his word that he did not make that statement and therefore I hope that the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South will not refer to it again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Would it be a use of a parliamentary term to refer to the comments made by the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South as a blobbyism? It is becoming apparent that that is his contribution on most occasions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is unfortunate that Members of the Labour party wrote the script for their speeches before the Bill was published. They decided that my right hon. friend the Secretary of State would privatise Scotland's water. Regardless of the truth, the Bill and the categorical assurances given by the Under-Secretary of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries, they have decided to run with that notion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I am writing my speech now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. These are not proper points of order. The hon. Member should know better.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I was saying, and as the opposition have proved, they have made no attempt to deal with the question of the need to restructure Scotland's water and sewerage services. They have not attempted to consider how they would seek the investment that is required. I accept, as do my hon. Friends, that, under our system, bills for Scotland's water and severage services will have to rise, but they will have to rise regardless of the system that is in place after next April or the April beyond that. We are trying to put in place the system that will best and most cheaply provide the services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman explain what powers the new public water authorities will have for raising finance, that locally elected councils do not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman waits I shall deal with that point.<br><br>
We are putting in place a system that will provide vital services more cheaply that any other. What we are hearing
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1572</span>
from the Opposition Benches is strange, because when the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) was shadow Secretary of State—and the hon. Member for Fife, Central laughs, because he used to laugh at what that hon. Gentleman said—he wrote in the <i>Evening Times</i> on 14 June 1993
<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State will soon take his decision on Scotland's water. He has said that he will act in the best interests of the Scots. This clearly means that he intends to leave water and sewerage services where they belong—and where the majority of Scots want them—firmly in public hands".</p></blockquote>
That is exactly what my right hon. Friend is proposing—three public water boards to keep water and sewerage firmly in the public sector. Yes, there is a question of who will sit on the boards—whether councillors will be present in a minority, a majority or not at all. I think that councillors will sit on each board, because they will have relevant experience.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend mentioned the hon. Member for Monklands, West. On Saturday the right hon. and learned Member for Monklands, East (Mr. Smith) spoke to the Federation of Small Businesses in Edinburgh. He suggested that the public and private sectors should come together. Does not the Bill allow that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. There is a debate about the membership of the boards. The Labour party does not seem to realise that we are trying to make a range of talents available to run the boards. [<i>Interruption.</i>] Labour Members scoff at that. They seem to be under the impression that only elected councillors have the knowledge, expertise and experience to run Scotland's water and sewerage services after reorganisation. We are creating a public-private partnership—a partnership that is Labour party policy. Did not the hon. Member for Hamilton, on the publication of Labour's document "Financing Infrastructure Investment—promoting a partnership between public and private finance", say:
<br><blockquote><p>"You are talking about extra public investment by freeing up the possibility of extra private capital.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>It's a practical way of boosting public investment when public money is short."</p></blockquote>
That is exactly what we are doing. Labour Members can say that we are adopting Labour party policy, but they cannot have it both ways. They cannot say that using the private sector to supplement and augment public finance is fine for roads, for example, but not for water and sewerage. That is incoherent nonsense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Gentleman says backs our case, not his. There is nothing wrong with 12 water authorities, made up of directly-elected local councillors responsible and accountable to the local electorate, raising money in the private market for investment in the water and sewerage system. The words of mine that the hon. Gentleman quoted are true. He wants to remove that democratically-accountable level—which is considered so important by the people of Scotland—from the delivery of water services. I ask the hon. Gentleman to keep reading my words. Perhaps eventually he will learn from them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course there is nothing wrong with what the hon. Gentleman is suggesting, but
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0870">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1573</span>
he is missing the point that there is another, better and cheaper way of doing that, which is what we are proposing. What he suggested in that document can be achieved. Our system will achieve that result in a better and more cost-effective manner. Why does not the hon. Gentleman accept that? We do not need joint boards staffed by councillors and only councillors to achieve that end. A huge range of talent is available in Scotland that can be pulled into the water authorities to augment and supplement their present work.<br><br>
The Labour party's document, which the hon. Gentleman asked me to read, continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"There should be no ideological dogma over the source of funds for public projects. For too long, political ideology has dominated the issue of public funding."</p></blockquote>
What we have heard from Labour Members in our debate is nothing short of political dogma and ideology.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Is not this a debate? It appears that the hon. Gentleman will not give way to interventions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is no requirement on the hon. Gentleman to give way to interventions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is not giving way.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1574</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Is it in order for the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South to overact so much?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not for a moment belittle the contribution that local councillors will make to the authorities. With such strong and able councillors as I have in my constituency, I dare not belittle what they do. However, in Scotland we have a pool of talented people from a wide range of backgrounds who can work with councillors in the delivery of community services.<br><br>
The hypocrisy of the Labour party on the issue is staggering. For 130 hours they have railed, voted and argued against joint boards. They have moved amendments and talked to them, telling us that joint boards are wrong for the police, that they cannot deliver police services, and are wrong for fire services, special education and public transport. Suddenly, we are told that they are right for delivering water and sewerage services. The hon. Members for Hamilton and for Fife, Central have yet to say why we have been preached at for 130 hours about why joint arrangements will not work but are now suddenly asked to believe that they will. They have yet to answer that question.</span></p>
