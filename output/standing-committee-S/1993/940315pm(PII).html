	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Local Government etc. (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>[continuation from column 1176]</p>
	<p>8.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many hours ago, I tried to speak about the interface between the police and the social work department on the delicate matter of child abuse, which worries many of us. Fred Edwards, a distinguished man in Strathclyde, who now lives in Lothian, wrote from his experience of social work:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Rolling in service … is absolutely paramount and good effective training is achieved most economically by larger authorities. The consultative back up can only be achieved by larger authorities, and the relationship with contingent services is vital. You simply cannot have a Chief Constable or a Director of Education or a Director of Social Work acting unilaterally. The value of such people acting as a team has been demonstrated at its best in the larger authorities."</p></blockquote>
I simply put down a marker. I appreciate that the Committee wishes to move on to discuss fire. What is the Government's view on dealing with the difficult, often specialised, always sensitive matter of child abuse? I should not complain if the Minister did not answer, but perhaps, he would like to comment on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises the matter of child abuse and other factors that are relevant to education and social work, which could have a bearing on police costs. I shall explain how the costs will be arranged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall outline the arrangements for attributing costs between Lothian region and Borders region, which form an existing joint police board. I am considering an existing model. However, that model need not be used for the joint boards that the Bill establishes. Each new joint board will be able to determine the most suitable method. Consultation will take place with police authorities. The Secretary of State has to approve the amalgamation scheme and make the first one. When he does that, after consultation with COSLA, he must approve the funding methodology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The South-Eastern Police (Amalgamation) Order 1975 provides for the combination of the police areas of Lothian region and Borders region and the administration of the combined police area by a joint police committee.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1178</span>
Under section 19(2)(d) of the Police (Scotland) Act 1967, an amalgamation scheme provides for the payment by the constituent authorities, in such proportion as may be specified in the scheme, of the expenditure incurred by joint police committees in performing the functions delegated to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under section 2 of the 1967 Act, the delegated functions are: to provide pay, allowances and expenses for police officers—and for their civilian staff—and buildings vehicles, apparatus and other equipment for the police force. A new article substituted in the amalgamation scheme in 1992 specifies that the expenditure incurred in carrying out those functions shall be apportioned between Lothian regional council and Borders regional council as the expenditure arises in providing the police service in each of the areas of the two councils. The two councils decided that that was a fairer division than the previous arrangement, which was based on the population of the two areas. Borders complained that its burden was too heavy. The costs are not assessed on population but on policing activities. In making the change, Borders followed a precedent set by the Highlands and Islands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To apportion expenditure as it arises in the two areas, it is necessary to determine the extent of provision of police service in each area in every respect, including the issues referred to by the hon. Gentleman. The extent of provision is determined by the location of officers, civilians, buildings, vehicles or equipment in the different geographical divisions into which the Lothian and Borders force area is divided. The extent of provision in the two constituent areas is measured by the police board, in drawing up its annual expenditure budget, in accordance with article 29 of the South Eastern Police (Amalgamation) Order 1975. Methods of allocation have been agreed between Lothian and Borders regional councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, expenditure on staff is apportioned according to the location of the staff concerned in Lothian or Borders. Central staff costs are divided in the same proportion; expenditure on buildings and vehicles is apportioned by reference to the location of the building or vehicle concerned. Other expenditure is apportioned either on the basis of identifiable costs in the two areas or in the same proportion as identifiable staff costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have described the present arrangement, which works well. It demonstrates that we can take account of the views of authorities in joint boards. As I said earlier, that does not mean that we have to apply the arrangement to the new joint boards, but the Secretary of State will take full account of the preferences of the new boards and their constituent authorities before making the initial amalgamation schemes under clause 34.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present preferences are for the constituent council—the police authority—to bear the costs of policing undertaken in its area. If the precedents of Borders, Lothian and Highlands and Islands authorities are followed, expenditure will be based on policing, not population. I have tried to answer the hon. Gentleman as comprehensively as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for what I had better call his anticipatory answer. Perhaps in the next few weeks, a senior Scottish Office official might care to make an appointment with Professor Edwards, who has great experience in this field. That would be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 35, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 36</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>FIRE SERVICES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 388, in page 30, line 29, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"and all existing uniformed and non-uniformed staff shall be retained by the brigades.".</p></blockquote>
I should be grateful to hear the Minister's comments on the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to accept the principle behind the amendment. New section 147 of the Local Government (Scotland) act 1973 provides that the fire brigades prior to reorganisation will continue in existence after reorganisation. As a consequence, there is no need to make further provision for the transfer of uniformed members of fire brigades.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to accept the principle that non-uniformed staff of fire brigades should all transfer to the new fire authorities and joint boards as appropriate. Since the amendment refers also to uniformed staff—that is, to members of the fire brigade—who, as I have already explained, are covered by the terms of the Bill, I cannot accept the amendment as it stands. But I am prepared to undertake to table an appropriate Government amendment on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the Committee would appreciate the variety of getting the Minister to speak early rather than having to listen to us. We welcome the Government's willingness to transfer the fire fighting staff who do such an excellent job in Scotland. That applies increasingly to the rescue services in general. However,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1180</span>
why did the Government not make such an amendment essential to the deliberations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have said that the amendment is defective. We accept that, but it is crucial to the morale of staff in the fire and rescue services, and of every other staff member, that they can be certain that they will have a job after the reorganisation. That raises the anomaly concerning the position of all other local employees in Scotland. The Government today have accept the transfer of police staff, and of personnel in the fire service. I note that the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Eastwood, has acknowledged that he is listening to the debate. I hope that he will want to consider further the position of the quarter of a million employees who will not be covered by the same transfer arrangements that have been extended to staff and employees in the fire and police services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are pleased that the principle of the amendment has been accepted, and hope that the Government will table a suitable amendment on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 312, in page 30, line 31, leave out first "Act".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a minor technical amendment deleting a superfluous reference to "Act".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 313, in page 30, fine 33, after "shall" insert
	<br><blockquote><p>", until 31st March 1996, continue to be a regional or islands council and thereafter shall".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take Government amendment No. 315.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 313 removes any doubts about which local authorities are the fire authorities in the periods to 31 March 1996 and from 1 April 1996. Regional councils and island councils at present are the fire authorities for their areas. That will pertain until 31 March 1996. After that date, the local authorities provided for in the Bill, and in the provisions of the 1973 Act as amended by the Bill, will be the fire authorities for their areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until 31 March 1996, the fire authorities in Scotland will continue to be the regional and islands councils. From 1 April 1996, the fire authorities will be the local authorities to be set up in accordance with the provisions of the Bill. Amendment No. 315 incorporates in the proposed substituted section 36(15) of the Fire Services Act 1947 a more specific provision—by reference to clause 2 of the Bill—of who the fire authority will be in Scotland from 1 April 1996.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the amendments to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again we enter the realms of fantasy in terms of what the reorganisation will mean for the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0656">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1181</span>
people of Scotland. We have been told that there will be 30 police authorities. That was confirmed earlier. We now know that there will be 30 fire authorities. That is in addition to the joint structures provided for in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister not see an inherent conflict between powers exercised by a fire authority, in the form of a unitary authority, and the joint arrangements on fire and rescue throughout the length and breadth of Scotland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
8.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What powers will the fire authorities have? That is crucial to the points that we have made about increased bureaucracy, and the increasing interface between the joint authorities and the fire authorities. I hope that the Minister will respond positively to my concern about who does what, especially in those 30 fire authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The powers of the fire authorities will be necessary in order to put out fires in their areas. 	<i>[Laughter.]</i> These are purely technical matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What does this measure have to do with fires?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that tidying up and clarifying the dates for responsibility is wholly in the public interest. We have a great deal of experience from the operation of the two joint fire boards. Many respondents to the consultation document referred to the success of those arrangements. We propose to put the experience gained from the operation of those joint working arrangements to full use in preparing framework administration schemes for the proposed new joint working procedures. We still envisage that the administration schemes will provide for the new councils to be the fire authorities for their areas with the functions of those authorities being delegated as appropriate to the new joint boards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again, I should like to try to get an explanation of what the 30 fire authorities will do that will not be done by the combined authorities. I appreciate that putting out fires is in the public interest—I shudder to think what it would be like if it was not in the public interest. Can the Minister tell us why, in this reorganisation, we shall end up with 60 authorities dealing with police and fire?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Kynoch (Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Every time the hon. Gentleman speaks the figure goes up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my arithmetic is reasonably good at this time of night. There will be 30 police authorities and 30 fire authorities—I am getting nods of approval for my arithmetic—and there will be eight joint boards for police and six joint administrative schemes for fire. What will the fire authorities do that will not be done by the administrative arrangements?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The provision is exactly the same as for the police. There will not be 60 authorities, there will be about 30. I cannot give the hon. Gentleman the exact number of authorities because my hon. Friend the Minister said that he would consider one
	<span class='label label-info column'>1182</span>
or two matters. But there will be about 30 authorities and they will be dealt with on the same basis as the police. There will be maximum continuity of provision. We have no doubt that the high standards of efficiency shown by the fire service will be maintained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Only in the previous contribution did we learn that the Under-Secretary, hon. Member for Eastwood, is, true to form, thinking about having more authorities. That should not come as a surprise to the Committee or the wider population. Today the proposed number of fire authorities is 30, but will there be 31 or 32?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or 29.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South suggests 29, so one area might have its status withdrawn. The key issue remains: whether there are 30 or 35, fire and police authorities are being established everywhere and there will be a joint apparatus to put out fires. Will the police authorities own the fire equipment, will the staff be employed by the fire authority or will the staff and the equipment be the preserve of the joint arrangements? Those are the nuts and bolts of the reorganisation. No answers were given on the police authorities, and now no answers are being given on the fire authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a simple question about fire equipment and appliances, turntable ladders and similar items and employees. Are they the preserve of the joint arrangements or of the fire authorities, of which 30 are proposed to date?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Considerable satisfaction has been shown on a constituency basis for the service provided by the fire service, which in my constituency is in Bathgate and Livingston. It has received much praise and I cannot think of a recent complaint about it. However, we cannot be sure that that will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a direct question about bulk purchasing. As I understand it, much expensive equipment is purchased by authorities such as Lothian and Strathclyde. If they are shattered into many different authorities, will the arrangements still apply? If so, how will the advantages of bulk purchasing obtain?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join my hon. Friend in paying tribute to the fire service. Most of my constituency is served well by retained and part-time firemen who work for the Lothian and Borders fire board. They do an excellent job. I am not sure what such disruption will do for their morale, but I know that the morale of those in the public service has been affected by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central spoke about the assets of the fire stations such as fire tenders and equipment. We should not lose sight of the fact that fire hydrants are another of the fire services's vital assets. They are provided by water authorities. At present, water authorities are coterminous with fire authorities and there is excellent co-operation between them to ensure that hydrants are maintained, that everyone knows where they are and that the fire service has easy access to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Later, we shall deal with clauses that could have serious implications for the fire service. If fire authorities lose
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0657">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1183</span>
control over water mains and fire hydrants, it could create considerable difficulties. I want to know what the fire service thinks about that and whether the Minister has begun to think about the implications.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In reply to the hon. Member for Fife, Central, fire authorities are assigned the statutory duty to deliver fire services. The duties are delegated to the fire boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fire hydrants and fire equipment will be owned by the joint boards and they will employ fire service staff. Bulk purchasing will be a matter for the boards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with interest to the Minister, but two issues have not been clarified. The first is minor, but it is important for cats and children. The fire brigade does not just put out fires even though that is its main responsibility. If a cat is stuck up a tree, one calls the fire brigade to get it down. If someone gets his head stuck in a railing—I can think of someone whose head I would like to see stock in a railing—one usually calls the fire brigade. Those are trivial examples, but there are many others of the fire brigade being called to do other than put out a fire. We should be aware of such ancillary tasks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has given two interesting examples of cases in which firemen have to deal with incidents other than fire. Road traffic accidents are another serious example! Who will have responsibility for them? During our debates on the police, the Minister suggested that road traffic accidents may no longer be the responsibility of the police.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps, I was being too trivial. This is our third sitting of the day and there is a tendency towards triviality in the third sitting. My hon. Friend is right. In serious road accidents in which people are caught in a vehicle, the fire brigades provide the key personnel for removing survivors or bodies from vehicles. I hope that those additional non-fire tasks will remain their responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all laughed when the Minister said that the brigades will have the powers necessary to put out fires. Members of the Committee accept that that is the prime responsibility, but we should be given assurances about the others.

I am not sure that I understand the different responsibilities of authorities and of boards. The authorities will have statutory responsibility conferred on them by the Bill. They will have the power of raising
	<span class='label label-info column'>1184</span>
money and ultimate responsibility for carrying out tasks, but what would happen if, administratively, the 12 authorities in Strathclyde were required to get together to provide the service through a joint board? Will there be clarion cries of "Sack the board" if the 12 do not like what the joint board says?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not clear about what will happen if individual authorities are unhappy about what a board does. In many cases, no problem will arise. The board will carry out its responsibilities and it will be accepted, understood and agreed to by all the authorities. What will happen, however, if there is a dispute?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Lothian and Borders police and fire boards were set up, there were disputes about financial responsibilities. It would be helpful if the difference between the responsibilities of the authorities and of the boards were spelt out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The authorities will, presumably, nominate members pro rata to serve on the boards. My hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian raised a valid point about a board in Lothian region, where Edinburgh will be the dominant authority. Elsewhere, one or two authorities could dominate and the interests of particular parts of an area might not be represented properly. I would welcome the spelling out of responsibilities and status of authorities and of boards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to follow up the Minister's response to a question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow. He said that equipment would be owned by a joint board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want the Minister to clarify who would pay for such equipment and in what proportions. What would happen if the equipment was specialised? For example, would high turntable ladders, which are unlikely to be used in rural areas, be paid for only by those areas with multi-storey flats or tenements or would the cost be divided pro rata?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will be the arrangement for purchasing new capital equipment? Will capital allocations be made on a board-by-board basis or on an authority-by-authority basis? Would individual authorities then have to determine how much of their allocation in turn was given to the joint boards for the fire service, the police service or any other service?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How are revenue costs to be allocated between the authorities? Should a policeman telephone from Ibrox to say that the stadium is on fire, he will be paid for by the club if he is inside the stadium. If he is outside the stadium, I am unclear about who pays for him, even though he is on football duty. I am similarly unclear about who pays the fireman who turns up to deal with the fire at or near Ibrox. If the fire engine comes from Glasgow, is it paid for by Glasgow? If a second one is called in from Paisley, is that one paid for by Paisley? If, on the way, the fire engine has to stop off to rescue a cat from a tree, is that charged to the authority in which location the cat's owner resides, or is it charged to the authority that is responsible for the location where the cat was when it had to be rescued?

If there is an accident and the driver has to be removed from a car, is that service charged to the authority where
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0658">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1185</span>
the accident happened, the authority in which the car was based or, if the driver was simply passing through an area, it is charged to another authority?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must explain how the charging mechanism for the joint board will work between authorities. Again, as applied to the police, we run the risk of establishing some sort of external charging mechanism, which will be enormously complex and which, in addition to the diseconomies of de-scaling, will place enormous financial burdens on the individual fire authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to continue that theme because the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Govan may not have captured some of the difficulties that I see in the Bill about charging and the problem of surpluses or deficits on an account. When I was the leader of a council great difficulties arose in getting the budgets correct. Often the budget was compiled at the beginning of the year. It was then subject to some sort of capping by the Government—that was common in the late 1980s—which caused problems in adjusting the budget. Sometimes the budget was incorrect and the spend at the end of the year was greater than the anticipated spend when the budget was drawn up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already established that the boards are the spending organisations of the fire service. They are not the revenue raisers, but what in England are called the precepts on the authorities to pay for the boards' costs. What if the boards overspend and there is a deficit at the end of the year?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I foresee a difficulty in central Scotland. Although we do not have fixed boundaries at the moment for the whole of Scotland, and the Minister is studying central Scotland carefully and, according to his proposed boundaries, Stirling will be a small authority. Let us take the example of the petrochemical industry at Grangemouth: in the past, there have been serious accidents there. Although the large explosion tragically cost two lives, thank goodness it did not cost more. If there had been a major explosion, the damage would have been massive according to the Health and Safety Executive report. If the tank that had blown up at BP chemicals had hit the plant, rather than landing a quarter of a mile away on the shore, there would have been devastation in Grangemouth. If the massive costs that would have been entailed by the fire services and support services at Grangemouth ran into a massive deficit at the end of the year, how would the authority allocate those costs? Would Stirling be expected to spend proportionately on that overspend or would there be another method whereby the fire brigade and Central region would be given that money by the Government?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Budgeting is very difficult for emergency services because one does not know how many emergencies will occur and when they do occur, there is a large drain on the resources. Let us hope that no such emergency occurs in any part of Scotland, but if there is one, who will pay in the end? Will the authorities be able to decide to opt out and object? Will Stirling be able to argue that the incident did not occur in its area; that the point of the new service and the disaggregation of local government was to secure a seat in Parliament and a Tory authority in Stirling, but not to place on the poor people of Stirling the burden of the cost of the petrochemical industry in Grangemouth?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1186</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We were unsuccessful in obtaining clear answers from the Minister earlier about how the constituent authorities would fund expenditure on police services. We are trying again to obtain a clear explanation about fire services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps, to help the Minister, I may refer him to his consultation document, "The Structure of Local Government in Scotland: Shaping the New Councils". It seems a lifetime ago that the Government issued it. On page 40 the report deals with funding of the two existing joint boards that provide fire services—the joint boards for Lothian and Borders and for the Highlands and Islands councils. The report deals with the funding of current expenditure by the two joint boards. Two different models are presented. The funding of current expenditure by the Lothian and Borders joint board.
	<br><blockquote><p>"is obtained from the constituent councils in accordance with an agreed formula"</p></blockquote>
which is that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the expenditure is apportioned between the constituent authorities in proportion to the adult population of their respective areas".</p></blockquote>
The liability for funding fire services depends on and is limited by the adult population in an area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Highland and Islands model is a very different one, in which
	<br><blockquote><p>"expenditure is apportioned according to the extent of provision by the board in the areas of each of the constituent authorities."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, if one of the constituent authorities receives a higher level of provision of fire services, it becomes liable for funding it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those models are very different and I accept that they were agreed by the joint boards. Opposition Members are concerned, however, about possible failure to agree by the new joint boards. What criteria will the Minister impose on them if the constituent authorities cannot agree a formula for funding of fire service spending in certain areas? Will he adopt the Lothian and Borders model or that of the Highland and Islands councils? Both sides of the Committee deserve an answer to that question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First I shall respond to the inquiry by the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) about the existing relationship between the councils and the fire authorities. Regional and island councils in Scotland are currently the fire authorities for their areas. Section 147(2) of the 1973 Act makes it clear that that will remain the case until 13 March 1996. Even where there are joint working arrangements for the provision of fire services in Lothian and Borders and in the Highland and Islands that provision on fire authorities has been reflected in the contents of the administration schemes for the provision of fire services in those areas. The administration schemes provide, however, for the functions of fire authorities to be transferred to the joint board, with the exception of functions relating to levy rates and to amend the provisions of the administration schemes. I mentioned earlier that purchasing is a matter for the joint boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Considerable experience relating to the funding of joint boards has been gained from the operation of the Lothian and Borders and Highland and Islands schemes. The Secretary of State intends to put that experience to full

use in developing the administration schemes that are proposed under what will be, when clause 36 takes effect, the new section 147 of the 1973 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a moment. In relation to capital expenditure, the joint boards will be bodies corporate and will have power to hold land and to borrow funds. Under the section 94 capital allocations arrangements, provision will be made for relevant capital expenditure in the boards' areas. The same procedures are currently used for Lothian and Borders and the Highlands and Islands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped that the Minister would give way earlier, but I am grateful to him for doing so now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether the Minister understands that when he tells us that the Government will develop administrative arrangements it sends a shiver down my spine and probably does the same to a lot of other people. He appears to be saying that there is at present no administrative system to put in place. If the administrative system is to be changed, will there be any consultation with people who now run the service?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There have already been consultations and representations have been received. The success of the joint boards as they now exist in the Highlands and Islands and lowlands and Borders has been fully taken into account. We shall use that experience to the full in preparing the framework for administration schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already told firemasters that we shall consult the shadow councils on the proposed administration schemes as we want to ensure that they provide a relevant framework for their purposes. The shadow fire authorities will then be able to take forward their detailed implementation plans. A replication of the procedures which were followed in the 1970s might risk bottlenecks towards the end of 1995. The procedures outlined in clause 36 will smooth the transition of fire services from the current local government structure to the new structure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that once the shadow authorities had been elected—a year before they take over the reins of power—they will be consulted about everything. How can the Minister usefully consult them if they do not have any staff? To make sense of a new administrative scheme, direct access is needed to the officials, staff and professionals who will run it. The shadow authorities will consist of elected members with perhaps a chief executive. They will not have the expertise or have officials working for them who are directly involved in running the fire service. How can the Minsiter make sense of such a consultation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is not quite correct; the shadow authorities will eventually become the new authorities—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Could you tell me what amendments we are discussing as I have lost my place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1188</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 313 and 315.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a wide-ranging debate. I shall answer the question asked by the hon. Member for Dundee, East about revenue expenditure. Section 36(15) of the Fire Services Act 1947—required that an administration scheme under the provisions of the Act should provide for the payment of contributions to the joint board towards the costs of expenditure incurred in such proportion as may be determined by or under the scheme. As I said earlier, the existing administration schemes for Lothian and Borders and Highlands and Islands provides for the joint boards to requisition funds from the fire authorities towards the revenue costs incurred in providing the fire service in the combined areas. The basis of apportionment has been reviewed from time to time and both schemes currently provide for the costs of the service to be apportioned among the fire authorities in relation to the provision of service in those areas. I mentioned earlier that our experience is that they work very well under the two joint bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fire authorities would be expected to take the initiative in relation to the development of proposals for changes in respect of the administration. In respect of cross-border provision, as now, fire authorities can, under the terms of section 12 of the Fire Services Act 1947, make arrangements for funding mutual assistance that is rendered between authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How, as a Lothian Member of Parliament, does the Minister justify the breaking up of our efficient fire service and it becoming dependent on what is apparently a joint board requisitioning fund? I shall go round Queensferry at the next election telling the people what their candidate has landed on them. I am exasperated by what the Minister has said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again, we have received no information that is of any help whatever from the Minister. We ask for explanations, we get descriptions; we ask for justifications and we get anything that is in the Government's mind except hard information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend said, it is the simple philosophy of, "It will be all right on the night". Is the Minister aware that he is dealing not with an inanimate object but with a fire and rescue service involving thousands of skilled, dedicated and committed staff? All the Minister can offer them is the utter nonsense of 30 fire authorities that will not implement their duties. Those duties will be passed to the joint administrative arrangement. We are still not clear who will own what, and the question of liabilities remains unresolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East asked, what happens if authorities in the new structure do not want to participate? The Government have statutory responsibilities and those authorities can be forced to participate—but why does every debate about reorganisation end up in a discussion of a two-tier structure? Every clause is the same. When will the Minister square up to reality, ditch this nonsense and recognise that a two-tier system is being recreated? The difference between the Government and the Opposition is that we believe in democracy for both tiers, while the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0660">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1189</span>
Government believe in democracy for the single tier. They are not bothered about the other tier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a sad state of affairs when a Minister cannot explain, justify or describe the implications on the ground of this nonsense. I hope that these Government amendments send a loud message back to Scotland that the Government do not care about the services. As long as they can bungle through the boundaries, they are happy to see services decimated. They have no regard for the long-term cost to council tax payers or to taxpayers. [HON. MEMBERS: "Rubbish."] Conservative Members say, "Rubbish", but every clause ends up establishing a two-tier structure. The Minister—and all other Ministers—must justify undertaking this reorganisation. They must know that there is no justification for it. The clauses are meaningless, but the issues that the Government ignore are very important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 389, in page 30, line 38, after "order", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"and after full consultation with the local authorities,".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 421, in schedule 13, page 151, line 33, leave out from "shall" to end of line 38 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"give to the fire authorities concerned notice of the general nature of the proposed scheme and unless those authorities intimate their assent thereto, the Secretary of State shall publish in one or more newspapers circulating in the areas of the council a notice of the general nature of the scheme, and shall cause a public local inquiry to be held by a person appointed by him, not being an officer of a fire authority or of any government department".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can be brief because our previous debates made it clear that it does not make much sense to push the idea of consultation when the Government are so confused about who should consult with whom. Amendment No. 389 would ensure at least that no matter what crazy system the Government eventually implement, a decision can be made that takes account of sound economic management. However, I fear that that would be difficult, given the extent of the farce that is proposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will try again to get an answer from the Minister, I hope with more success this time, on how he intends to agree through consultation with local authorities the funding for fire services in the new joint board areas. I want to make special reference to the mid-eastern area covering Angus, Dundee, Perthshire and Kinross.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And Jerusalem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not quite yet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that there was experience with two joint boards—Highlands and Islands and Lothian and Borders—and that the Government intend to put that experience to full use in the consultation with the shadow authorities and existing local authorities, which are the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1190</span>
fire authorities. However, there is a problem. The two existing examples offer two very different models. I know that the Minister will say that the Government will consult with the shadow authorities and with various people about what can be agreed. I am asking him to direct his attention to a situation in which agreement between the constituent authorities and the joint board area cannot be reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government must have a preference for one of the two models. Will the Minister make it clear what is that preference? Is it for the Lothian and Borders model, under which the funding of the constituent authorities relates to the adult population in each of their areas? Or do the Government prefer the Highlands and Islands model, under which the funding for which each constituent authority will be liable will relate to the provision of fire services in its area? That makes a significant difference to the people that I represent in the city of Dundee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If funding is based on adult population, there would be an upper limit to the amount that Dundee will be expected to contribute towards its fire services. If it is based on the provision of fire services, we are likely to pay much more than we would if population is used as the basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must be clear, because we are talking about significant expenditure. In 1992–93, £145 million of revenue expenditure was for the provision of fire services in Scotland. That large sum will mean an awful lot to council tax payers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The budget for capital allocations in 1992–93 was £8 million. The Minister says that will be allocated to joint boards. How that allocation is spent will depend on who sits on the boards. What will be Dundee's representation on the joint board for mid-eastern? Will Dundee have a majority on that board? If it has less than a majority the other constituent authorities could combine to ensure that the money was spent not in Dundee but their own areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's response to the questions that I and my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East asked was badly handled. We did not get the kind of information that people in central Scotland or Dundee require to assess what the Government intend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to who will run joint boards, in the scenario portrayed by the Minister in terms of boundaries, Stirling will be a very small authority, with 81,000 people. Falkirk and Clackmannan, if combined, will be a much larger authority of 195,000 people. The representation on the board from each of those two authorities, as defined in the clause, would be tremendously disproportionate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I expect that Falkirk and Clackmannan will have a vastly larger number of voting board members. They would be expected by their constituents to look after the interests of their own area. That is the reality. The idea is not to serve on a joint board and then to walk away from the basis upon which Scotland's democratic system runs. Representatives are elected by constituents within wards and divisions—although I do not know what they will be called in the future—and then serve on any authority to safeguard the interests of those who elect them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will not be in the interests of the people of Falkirk and Clackmannan to bankroll the services in Stirling. If representatives had been asked to give away their right to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0661">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1191</span>
look after the interests of their own people, there would rightly be criticism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is bad enough at the moment within a region. I imagine that much greater difficulty occurs in Strathclyde than in Central, as people from different divisions of Strathclyde try to allocate services across the region. How much more difficult does the Minister think that it will be, to try to balance the two problems—that is, the spread of services in the sense of what is appropriate for the whole of a board against the wishes of the people of one area to get the better part of the services, if it is a two-part board, for their own area and to pay as little as possible for services in one outside their local authority?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not answer the questions that he was asked. What will happen regarding deficits and overspending in the authority area? He refers to the 1947 Act, which was put in place when the 1929 local government Act was still in place. It has seen good service in the joint boards for the Highlands and Islands, and for Lothian and Borders. It has been taken out of the cupboard and dusted down—it has not even been amended or upgraded—to be used post-1994, when local government will be fragmented and disaggregated. The Minister gave inadequate replies. I hope that his next responses will be more specific and detailed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My officials have written to firemasters in Scotland outlining the provisions in the Bill on fire services. They included the proposed arrangements for the Secretary of State to prepare an administration scheme under the provisions of Section 147 of the 1973 Act as proposed in clause 36. The Department believes that the framework for the new joint arrangements should be in place relatively soon after the shadow councils are elected in April 1995. As I said earlier, we shall build on the experiences gained in the existing administration schemes for the provision of fire services in Lothian and Borders and Highland and Islands in drawing up draft proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already indicated to firemasters that we shall then consult the shadow councils about the proposals, because we wish to ensure that they will provide a framework within which the fire authorities can take forward their detailed implementation plans for fire service arrangements in the combined areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about recommended practice, and whether the arrangements will be based on population or on costs. Lothian and Borders joint board has changed its procedures. Since 1 April 1993, it bases its procedures on costs. Highlands and Islands follows the same procedure. Before we reach our conclusions, we shall consult the shadow authorities.

The amendment seeks to wipe six ludicrous phrases from the Bill. Through political ignorance or prejudice, the Government want to change the names for the new authorities. The tale begins when, at a Conservative party

	<span class='label label-info column'>1193</span>
conference, the Prime Minister described Strathclyde as a monstrosity. The Government will go to any length to scrub the name of Strathclyde from the records of the fire service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have just dealt with the police service. It made sense to call the new joint arrangement for Strathclyde by the name of Strathclyde. However, for the fire service, the region will be called Mid and South Western. Why? Is there something in the Government's psyche that cannot tolerate the word "Strathclyde" appearing on fire appliances, uniforms and headed notepaper? It is farcical that the clauses on police and fire authorities end up with different descriptions for the same area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Strathclyde has 343 vehicles, 127 buildings, 3,000 uniforms, 720 breathing apparatus sets and brigade stationery. Alterations will have to be made to them as well as to brigade command and control systems. In Lothian and Borders, alterations will be needed to 111 vehicles and 30 work places. It does not take a genius to calculate that much work would be involved in changing the name of Strathclyde to the ludicrous title of Mid and South Western.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The technicalities involved are preposterous, but the costs are staggering. It is estimated that the cost of changing Strathclyde brigade's name could be almost £200,000. Is the Minister still prepared to confirm that the Conservatives are still the party of sound money, or have they taken leave of their collective senses? It will cost £57,000 to change operations and technical services, £129,000 for personnel matters such as uniforms and training, and £10,000 for fire safety services. The total comes to just over £196,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Strathclyde fire brigade has a nationally and internationally renowned fire training centre, which has gained its reputation under its existing title. Who thought up the crazy conversion? It will cost Strathclyde people a lot of money. If Strathclyde forms half of Scotland and changes are made throughout Scotland—I accept that not every area will change its name—between £400,000 to £500,000 could be spent, when both the police and fire services are starved of resources for front-line activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Strathclyde, the training centre supplies on-going quality training in many aspects of fire brigade duties and it uses all the equipment that I mentioned. Apart from the ludicrous costs, the marketing benefits of retaining the name would be lost. I sincerely hope that when my hon. Friends elaborate—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has every right to say that, because this is a daft idea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am eternally suspicious of the process of Government.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valuable point, but I do not believe that the civil service would be guilty of that. I sincerely hope that the Minister will accept our amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1194</span>
There has been much hilarity about changing names, but it is sinister to think that the changes are due to the Government's determination to remove the name of Strathclyde from local government How did the Government arrive at the names of mid and south-western? Mid what? Is south-western anywhere near Dumfries and Galloway, or is it the deep south or the north-west in relation to England? What a nonsense. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary is studying the brief. I would like a simple answer, and for him to say that he intends to accept all the amendments, save the taxpayers in those regions hundreds of thousands of pounds, and return the Committee to sanity at a time when it is much needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In addition to the changes that are to be made, what about the brigade command and control systems? I confess that it is some years since I visited Lothian brigade command and control system, but has the Minister been there recently to see that very sophisticated operation? If so, has he talked to the people there about what the changes would mean? What advice has he received? Apart from the money, there is also the question of efficiency. To undo Lothian brigade command and control system is the height of irresponsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister comment on the proposal in amendment No. 442? It may not be politically correct because the title of firemaster may have a gender bias in some people's minds. That was not my intention. [HON. MEMBERS: "It is associated with grand master."] I am too young and innocent to know anything about grand masters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has the Minister given this matter proper thought? He received advice from the advisory council, fire brigades and Equal Opportunities Commission. I read some of the correspondence on the questions raised by the northern brigade. We should not abandon titles that have served us well for many years. If we standardised titles with those used in England and Wales and adopt the title "chief officer", it could make the functions slightly confusing. I am prepared to live with an element of gender bias, to retain the title of an important post in our fire brigade service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first column of the table in section 147(4) of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, amended as proposed in clause 36, sets out the combined areas for which the Secretary of State will be making administration schemes. They will relate to the provision of fire services for the local government areas set out in the second column of the table, which comprise the combined areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The administration schemes will provide for the names of the joint fire boards and for the fire brigade. In correspondence sent to firemasters, officials confirmed that the Government are content for the existing fire brigade names to be retained in the arrangements that will apply for 1 April 1996.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise that the shadow fire authorities may have views on those points, and the procedures outlined in section 147 of the 1973 Act as proposed in the Bill will provide the flexibility for taking such views into account when the administration schemes are being prepared.

I shall deal with the point made by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire in relation to amendment No. 442. The hon. Gentleman wants the title "firemaster" to be retained in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The repeal provisions proposed in schedule 14 to section 36 of the Fire Services Act 1947 would result in the title "chief officer" used in England and Wales being extended to Scotland. Over many years there has been substantial debate on the subject and many points have been made for and against such replacement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some parties considered that the term "firemaster" was sexist and contrary to equal opportunities. Others were firmly of the view that it had a non-gender application and that there were no grounds for change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part of the debate took place within the Scottish Central Fire Brigades Advisory Council, on which all fire service interests, including employers' representatives and employees' representative organisations, are involved. At its June 1992 meeting, the advisory council considered representations from the Fire Brigades Union that the title "chief officer" should be introduced in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Appreciating that the title "firemaster" was statutory and that no primary legislation was envisaged, the advisory council agreed that further consideration should be given to the points made in discussion, should an opportunity to amend the primary legislation arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Equal Opportunities Joint Committee of the Advisory Councils for England and Wales and for Scotland, in which again all fire service interests are involved, also considered representations on the continued use of "firemaster". The joint committee noted the agreement by the advisory council in Scotland that further consideration was to be given to the matter if a legislative vehicle was identified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some enthusiasm for equal opportunities because I once had the excitement of reporting the Secretary of State for Scotland to the Equal Opportunities Commission for discrimination against women. That Labour Secretary of State abandoned his plans. My point is valid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As part of the consultation arrangements relating to the local government reform the Government sought views on whether the post of firemaster should continue. In its comments on the consultation paper, Lothian regional council suggested that the title "firemaster" should be changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bearing in mind the comments made by the advisory council and the equal opportunities joint committee, Ministers were asked to review the matter. They took account of the views expressed and decided on balance that the title "chief officer" should be adopted in Scotland. We listened carefully to what was said and, after detailed consideration, I cannot accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little less exercised about the title "firemaster" than about command and control systems, which mean life or death. What is the situation in relation to them? Will they remain or not? I see that the Minister is asking for advice. It is reprehensible that he cannot answer that question off the top of his head.

We welcome the near intervention of the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson). Rebellions are few and far between and we offer him an open invitation to participate in respect of any future issues on which he holds strong views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We seem to be on a reasonably good run this evening. We have knocked up some successes on the transfer of staff, consultation, naming areas and councillors on police boards. Amendment No. 395 would ensure that when joint arrangements are established, no one but elected councillors from the constituent single-tier authorities would become board members. There is widespread concern about quangos, boards and joint committees. We want to make it possible for elected members still to have a say in affairs that affect their constituents under single-tier authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The provisions of section 147 of the 1973 Act as proposed in the Bill provide for the Secretary of State including in an administration scheme such provision as he considers appropriate or necessary. The amended wording proposed in the amendment does not appear necessary to achieve what is provided for in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding amendment No. 413, section 36 of the Fire Services Act 1947 requires administration schemes to provide for constituting a joint committee for administering a combined fire brigade in a combined area and for members of the joint committees to be appointed from elected members of the fire authorities, as the hon. Gentleman wants. At present, there are two such administration schemes, which we have discussed already.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to administration schemes that the Secretary of State will make under the powers of section 147 of the 1973 Act, he intends to include such provision as he considers appropriate or necessary. I assure the Committee that the Scottish Office continues to consider fire services as a local authority responsibility and that, similar to the provisions of section 36 of the 1947 Act, administration schemes will provide that the joint boards will comprise solely elected members of the fire
	<span class='label label-info column'>1198</span>
authorities involved. The future administration schemes will provide for the members of the joint board to elect their chairman and vice-chairman. Therefore, the hon. Gentleman's points are covered by our proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is becoming a regular pastime. In view of the Minister's reassurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 396, in page 32, Une, 7, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(8A) Accounts shall be kept of all transactions relating to all funds of every fire brigade and shall be—
	<ol>
	<li>made up in respect of each financial year; and</li>
	<li>audited by a professional accountant who is either an officer of the Commission for Local Authority Accounts or is an approved auditor appointed by the said Commission.".</li></ol></p></blockquote>
The amendment reflects an earlier one relating to the police, and is designed to obtain Government assurances about proper accounting procedures. We fear that fines of communication will be stretched when the command structure of 30 fire authorities, eight fire boards and the other bodies is activated. It is vital that there is proper auditing of those organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reinforce my point by giving information about the fire service in Strathclyde which responded to 62,396 calls last year and rescued more than 1,000 people—that figure does not include cats! There were 26,182 fires, 3,850 special service calls and 860 road traffic accidents. There are fire prevention joint units in schools, safety packages and the region-wide campaign for the installation of smoke alarms. In Strathclyde, Lothian and other areas economies of scale are providing value for money, linked as they are to effectiveness and economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is designed to set up proper procedures to safeguard funding and expenditure. It also raises the question how the fire services will be funded in future. We hope that the 30 fire authorities will give maximum priority to continuing the level of services that we now enjoy in Scotland, by committing cash. It is easy to promise to give priority to anything, but that must be backed by hard investment from the constituent authorities—the single tiers in the joint arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We asked earlier who will be in control. Chief officers—a new term—will govern the activities of the fire service. If the duties of a single-tier fire authority are taken
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0665">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1199</span>
over and implemented by the jointly administered bodies, will anyone in the finance department of the single-tier authority oversee fire and police services' expenditure? The link between the fire authority, the officer responsible for cash and the chief officer responsible for administrative arrangements will be crucial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to listen to the Government's half-baked proposals day in, day out—and we want firm answers. It is bad enough for the Government to bungle the boundaries and spend taxpayers' money like drunken sailors without their also failing to produce proper and effective systems to monitor expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are sick and tired of the Government suggesting that they are a sound-money party. A few minutes ago, an eminently sensible decision wiped from the Bill £400,000 of useless expenditure. If we go through the Bill in fine detail, we may find similar anomalies, which suggests the need for the strengthening of the financial accounting procedures suggested in the amendment. We want fundamental assurances about the systems and clarification of the financial operation, especially as Ministers are painting such a confused picture.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the Committee that the amendment is not strictly necessary. Fire authorities are responsible for the income and expenditure of their fire brigades, not of the brigade itself. The existing requirements for accounts and auditing will not be altered by the Bill. Section 96 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 requires every local authority to keep accounts of all transactions relating to all funds of the authority. The same section requires accounts to be audited by the Commission for Local Authority Accounts in Scotland. The administration schemes for the Lothian and Borders and the Highland and Islands fire boards reflect the audit requirements of section 96(4) of the 1973 Act.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened to the Minister saying over and over again that he hopes that it will be all right on the night. I agree. I have absolute confidence that if there were ever to be a fire at his house—I hope that there will not be one—in norm Berwick, in my constituency, the retained fire fighters of norm Berwick, Haddington, Tranent, East Linton and the surrounding areas will turn out and do their level best to look after his property and family as they would anybody else in that part of the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries me is the structure. He indicated to my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow that the boards and control systems will carry on as at present. But they will not—he has just told us that, in addition to the new fire boards listed in the amended clause, 30 new fire authorities will indirectly control those boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that there are circumstances in which that could lead to paralysis in decision-making about investment, equipment, sites, the development of buildings and the change in the structure of the fire service. We can all visualise circumstances in which the parent fire authorities—the small single-tier, all-purpose new local authorities—may want to ensure that a new fire service development takes place within their boundaries. That could be done regardless of the fact that the firemaster—a term saved by the hon. Member for Hexham—may think that the priority lies somewhere else. We could get some very messy decision-making. We could get decisions being deferred and investments that should be made might not go ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I am confident that firefighters will do their job as efficiently as possible and with their characteristic courage, there are genuine grounds for fearing that restructuring will lead to bad decisions and investments not going ahead in particular boards, at particular times. The efficiency of firefighters will be undermined and the Minister held responsible for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under the Fire Services Act 1947, the provision of fire services remains a local authority function.

The Lothians and Borders fire board and the Highland and Islands fire board have demonstrated how well such arrangements can work.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Sir Hector Monro)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subject to legislation, the seven river purification boards, for which the three island councils have some responsibility, will disappear in 1996, when they will be taken over by the Scottish environment protection agency, subject to legislation.

	<span class='label label-info column'>1202</span>
council responsibilities for air pollution and waste regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 37 is an insurance policy. If the legislation is not in place when the new authorities take over, the clause will enable river purification boards to continue. A variation order under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 will terminate the appointments of board members made by regional and district councils and replace them with shadow boards.

I accept that the Government are taking a belt and braces approach. They are taking a precaution in case the provisions for the environment protection agency are not on the statute book when the new local authorities take control. I appreciate that that is a remote possibility. But what will happen to solid waste and air pollution control? Subsection (2) will provide the protection that the Minister described. The fall-back provisions for solid waste and air pollution control are not clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon.

To answer the hon.

an order is made trunking or detrunking a proposed road or special road scheme, the successor authority should be placed in no better or worse position than its predecessor in advancing any proposals to improve or alter the road. The amendments also make some minor changes to ensure the correct operation of the present provisions. The clause will insert six new sections—12A to 12F—into the Roads (Scotland) Act 1984.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall discuss amendment No. 292 to 295. Section 12A would cover the trunking and detrunking of existing roads. Section 12B would cover the trunking and detrunking of proposed roads, prior to or during their construction, and section 12C would cover the transfers of special road schemes. Amendments Nos. 292 to 295 apply to sections 12B and 12C.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are necessary to ensure that the authority that takes over a road scheme is placed in no better or worse a position in relation to its right to proceed with the scheme than the existing authority would have been had there been no transfer. Section 12D would cover the transfer of property and liabilities between the Secretary of State and local roads authorities following the trunking or detrunking of roads, proposed roads and special road schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The transfers are effected by applying the provisions of section 112 of the 1984 Act, which deals with the transfer of property and liabilities. I consider it necessary to ensure that property and liabilities are also transferred as a result of any order under this clause. Amendment Nos. 296 and 298 are designed to achieve that in a straightforward way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 12E relates to when the Secretary of State seeks to trunk a proposed road or take over a special road scheme that is at an early stage in its development. Amendment Nos. 297 and 299 to 302 apply to section 12E.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 297, 299, 300, 301 and 303 are all necessary minor drafting amendments to correct and clarify current provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 363 is necessary for the effective operation of section 12E and would avoid duplication of effort and waste of resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 304 is purely a technical amendment. Amendment No. 364 deals with when the former local roads authority holds property which is partly used on a road to be trunked and partly used on other roads.

This is not a satisfactory time at which to conduct a debate in Parliament on how Scotland's road system will be administered, owned and managed in the future. Had we more time, it would have been interesting to explore some of the detailed points mentioned by the Minister under the previous group of amendments. Indeed, it was interesting to hear from him that one of the amendments was designed to avoid waste because of duplication. I think that much waste through duplication will result from several aspects of this legislation, not least from matters relating to highways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 397 would require the Secretary of State to publish his proposals on which roads will become trunk roads and which will remain under local authority responsibility. Again, as we debate different provisions in the Bill, it is clear that the Government are producing a two-tier system of administration in Scotland. They brought the Bill before the House under the slogan that they would do away with two-tier local government and would create single-tier local authorities that everyone would understand. Since then, however, they have done nothing but create board after board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On this occasion, the Government have proposed something even worse. The Secretary of State for Scotland, and not a board, will administer roads. Instead of such matters being considered by a nominated unaccountable joint board, they will be considered—under present circumstances—by a totally unaccountable Secretary of State for Scotland, who will not even be in Scotland but down in Dover House, for all we know. That proposal represents major extension of the powers of the Secretary of State for Scotland and it means that local control of the roads that, under his diktat, become trunk roads, will be lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, for example, local councillors, community groups or Members of Parliament want to suggest a pelican crossing for a particular spot, they can, at present, have the matter considered by a committee of the local authority and then by the full council. After the appropriate procedures they might obtain their pelican crossing to improve pedestrian safety. Under the new arrangement that process will be much more difficult. People will have to go all the way to St. Andrew's house or Dover house and undergo much more complicated and remote procedures rather than being able to obtain accountable decision making about roads in their own neighbourhood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We understand from the White Paper that the Secretary of State has it in mind to remove about 750 miles of roads
	<span class='label label-info column'>1206</span>
in Scotland from local authority control and make them trunk roads under his personal control. As I have said, that is a major extension to the powers of the Secretary of State. The Minister should tell the Committee what criteria will be used to select roads to be removed from local control and into the orbit of the Scottish Office, and what roads will be affected. Some examples of roads in different parts of Scotland, which have hitherto been in local authority control but which the Secretary of State is taking into his control, would be useful. That is the least that the Minister should be able to tell the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will we approach the allocation of resources or borrowing consent for roadworks—either the development of existing roads or the construction of new ones? Will the Secretary of State for Scotland do as local highways authorities now do, and produce the equivalent of a transport policy and programmes, to be judges on the same basis as local authority TPPs now are? That is a good system, whereby local authorities consult community groups, transport and environmental interests and others about how decisions on the construction and development of an area's road network should be approached. Proposals are then set out and submitted to the Secretary of State. The works to be done are prioritised and, when and if resources become available, they are carried out. That system offers accountability. The Secretary of State is not accountable, so it would be useful to receive assurances from the Minister about what accountability will exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will neighbourhoods be able to obtain pelican crossings, if those are required? Will there be proper scrutiny of or accountability for decisions that are taken on road planning? What provisions will there be for local contribution to and influence over those important decisions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter will become rather more complicated for the remaining highways authorities. Instead of the present 12 there will be 30 of them, or perhaps more, if the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Eastwood has his evil way with schedule 1 in due course. With fewer miles of road under local authority control, but more roads authorities, there will be a smaller cake and more shoes. How will the Scottish Office approach the distribution of grant-aided expenditure for roads and highways? It will be difficult to calculate the distribution of resources sensibly, particularly for some of the smaller authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
East Renfrewshire is perhaps the obvious example of a very small, new highways authority, which will have a pretty small network of roads. I cannot help returning to my question about the number of schools in each local authority area—to which the Minister replied that he did not know. I suppose that it is too much to hope that a Minister will have any idea of the number of miles of highways in each of the new local authority areas. It would be interesting to know. The contrast between Eastwood on the one hand and Highland region on the other will be dramatic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The extension of trunk roads in Scotland by about 750 miles will lead to a significant loss in local planning control over the surrounding areas. The Secretary of State will be the final arbiter for developments close to those trunk roads, which will reduce the amount of local input into decisions on industrial and housing developments, for example, in the vicinity of the new trunk roads. How
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0669">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1207</span>
will the Government deal with that issue? What guarantees will there be that local communities and the new local authorities will have a reasonable amount of influence and control over decisions about developments on or near the newly trunked roads?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will the Secretary of State manage those roads, or will we have a highways agency in Scotland? That could be the first step towards privatisation. Opposition Members have, over the years, thought of all manner of services in Scotland that we believed would be sacrosanct and kept in the public sector, despite what even this Government might want to do. Time after time, however, those services have been privatised. Does the Minister intend to establish a highways agency under the auspices of the Scottish Office to maintain and manage the roads, or will he keep it under genuine public ownership, open to public influence and control, at least for the time being?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As this is a broadly drafted amendment, I would be happy to discuss the staffing implications of the Bill, if that is in order, Mr. Martin. The trunking of roads, which have hitherto been under the control of local authorities, will mean that the people who manage and maintain those roads will presumably have to be transferred from their present local authority employers to the Scottish Office. What safeguards will there be for highways department officials and the people responsible for maintenance and administration? Will they be covered by the local authority staff commission, which we debated under clause 12? What rights will those employees have regarding the transfer of their jobs? That is a very important issue which the Minister should address—many of our constituents who work for highways departments would like the answers to those questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will the Secretary of State provide for the maintenance and management of the extra trunk roads in Scotland that he will be taking over? Will he continue the agency arrangements with local authorities? After all, those arrangements have been cost-effective and efficient, for more than 60 years in some cases. As agents for the Scottish Office, local highways authorities have cleared snow off the trunk roads, put down grit and undertaken maintenance and repairs. Will that continue and, if so, how? Instead of having regional highways departments which can do the job very efficiently, as at present, the authorities will be subdivided into much smaller ones. Will they be able to do the work, or will that function, once again, be a candidate for privatisation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that it will be possible for most of the new local authorities to maintain their direct labour organisations for the important and urgent works of winter maintenance, clearing snow, gritting, and dealing with emergencies such as floods. Those authorities will need to maintain their share of work on trunk roads to maintain those DLOs. The Minister must offer a guarantee that local authorities will retain that share of central Government work so that those DLOs can remain in existence. All hon. Members know from constituency examples that they have been thankful that the local highways authority has a pool of labour that can be brought in when there is a flood or some other natural disaster. That pool of labour may not be available in the future.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about the road safety specialists? I know that the matter is close to the Minister's heart. In his capacity as roads Minister in Scotland he has often expressed anxiety about the high number of road casualties. He knows that a number of regional councils have produced very professional highway safety strategies, targets and practical proposals to reduce the number of accidents. They have the staff to do that job. Will they be able to continue to do it in the watered-down scheme that we are to have?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will answer each of those important questions. All hon. Members have been well served by the highways department in their respective constituencies. We often have to correspond with directors of highways about the state of roads or about problems with pedestrian crossings or traffic lights. Without exception, I have found that the highways department does its job effectively and that the work gets done. I deplore that the Minister wants to interfere, once again, with a smooth operation. He will undermine the quality of service provided at present. A certain amount of the work will go the Scottish Office. I am very apprehensive about what that will mean for the future of Scotland's highway network.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will be brief, because I endorse everything that my friend the hon. Member for East Lothian has said. I pay tribute to his work as chairman of the A1 steering committee and action group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee must remember that a review of Scotland's trunk road and primary route network should not be conducted in the context of local government boundaries. It should be attuned more carefully to traffic flows and to linking cities, airports and other infrastructure elements that are so important to Scotland's economy. It is fair to examine the local government boundaries in the context of the future management and maintenance of that trunk road network, but not to go further. The hon. Member for East Lothian is right: the existing regional councils—and their predecessors the county councils—have, acting as agents for the Secretary of State, by and large discharged their duties superbly. It would be difficult to improve on what they have done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What plans do the Government have to re-examine the existing agency network? It is possible that alternative arrangements are being studied: last Sunday's edition of 	<i>The Observer</i> claimed that the Department of Transport may be considering wholesale privatisation of the route network south of the border. Some reassurance from the Minister about whether the Scottish Office had been consulted about any such plans would not go amiss. Will the Minister say what plans, if any, there are for any alternative system of agency network in the Scottish system? Certainly the situation may become more difficult for the reasons that the hon. Member for East Lothian has already explained; the set-up and the numbers of local authorities, which will be more fragmented. Those factors must be taken into account. It certainly will not make the situation any easier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subject to whatever nefarious activity the Government engage in at later stages on schedule 1, local authorities
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0670">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1209</span>
such as Borders, Dumfries and Galloway, Fife and Highland all have tried and tested experience in providing agency services for the maintenance and management of trunk road networks. I hope that the Minister will accept that they are willing and able to continue to carry out that work effectively. It would help the Committee if the Minister answered the question that the hon. Member for East Lothian asked him. What are the Scottish Office's plans about the primary road network? What, if any, will be transferred to Scottish Office control? The figure of 750 miles was mentioned and it is still our best estimate of the Government's intentions. Any additional detail that the Minister can share with the Committee would be extremely welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must face up to the fact that people need to know what the Government have in mind with regard to the agency agreements with local authorities. What will happen if the Secretary of State for Scotland decides that a part of a road should be altered into a trunk road? Will he take over any outstanding loan charges that the local authority might have on that road? If not, it would be a significant financial burden on some local authorities. The Government must know the answer to that question. They must have planned on the basis on whether or not that will happen. It is a fundamental question and I hope that the Minister will be able to respond to it in the course of the rest of the debate on this important amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For once the hon. Member for Ayr agrees with me. We must be right. While my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian was speaking, I was wondering about the motivation behind this centralisation; perhaps because of my training as a psychologist. I do not think that the Ministers are enthusiastic about it; perhaps the roads directorate of the Scottish Office is. It does seem strange that it is proposed to take away 750 miles of road from the administration of local councils and put it under central control.

Driving around Strathclyde and Lothian over the past few years, I have noticed how the public have become involved in complaints about road problems. Acronyms can sometimes seem a bit, if not exactly cheeky—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Childish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Almost childish. We are told to "Phone C.L.A.R.E.N.C.E." in Lothian.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That sounds like a Liberal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it does. Or to "Phone R.A.L.P.H." in Strathclyde. They work well and provide a free telephone number—an 0800 number—and I understand that many people have taken those opportunities to complain about roads. Will that customer involvement be continued under Scottish Office control?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Instead of Clarence or Ralph, it will be "Phone Lord James", if people want something done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have always thought that instead of an 0800 number for Strathclyde, the home number of the director of roads or of Councillor Waugh should be given. If the Scottish Office takes over, my hon. Friend is right—the Minister's number should be given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The large number of authorities will find it increasingly difficult to deal with services such as roads. Is the Government's strategy motivated not just by centralisation but the likelihood that more work would go out to tender to private contractors? That underlies much Government thinking, and it is evident again in this instance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many questions must be asked, and my hon. Friend the Minister for East Lothian asked most of them, such as whether staff would be moved alongside the transfer of responsibility for roads. A corollary of that is what happens to the staff dealing with roads in the Scottish Office? If its staff and the regional staff are to deal with the whole trunk road system in future, will the Scottish Office staff come under the ambit of the staff commission? The answer will be interesting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second question relates to an ambiguity in the procedure for objecting to the trunking or detrunking of roads. Does clause 38 supersede section 5(5) of the Roads (Scotland) Act 1984? I hope that the Minister can clear up that ambiguity, which worries some of those involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend raised the question of the arrangements for maintenance and management. I have also dealt with that in relation to public involvement. He asked about local control, given that capital allocations to the larger number of authorities will be much smaller. Will not it be much more likely that instead of an overall global programme in which local authorities decide their priorities, the Minister and his officials will move toward job-specific allocations and earmarking of particular projects? Instead of saying that one has £X million, from which one can choose the priorities, they will say, "Here is £X/10 million. Use it for that particular project." As a result, much local control will be lost.

	<span class='label label-info column'>1211</span>
Will the Minister explain what steps are being taken to ensure that modifications to the current system of grant-aided expenditure will be equitable in terms of expenditure need? Given the increase in road length and the smaller authorities, some indicators may not be present in a local authority area or may be irrelevant or unjust If indicators are not present, will not that create substantial anomalies?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When planning applications are made, a list of the bodies consulted is always produced. The Minister, the hon. Member for Dumfries, mentioned river purification boards, and they are sometimes consulted about planning applications. Sewerage authorities are another example. Roads authorities, such as Strathclyde or Lothian, are consulted about the implications for roads if a planning application is granted. Regional councils have a quick and efficient system for dealing with such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In future, more planning applications will have to go to the Scottish Office for its view. It will be running 750 miles more of roads. My experience is that it takes much longer to obtain a response from the Scottish Office than from regional councils. Therefore, there will be delays.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked earlier about the motivation behind the proposals and whether that was privatisation or more centralisation by the Scottish Office. It was brought to my attention that if the proposal goes ahead unamended, Scotland will have a system that is similar to the current one in London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh my God!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has put his finger on it, by expressing those words with such trepidation. We do not want such centralisation. It causes chaos and havoc in London, where it creates increasing congestion and difficulties. London suffers from a lack of road and transport planning. We do not want to import the London solution to Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was reminded by my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian and by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire of the winter of 1978. It was a bad winter with terrible snow, which the Minister, the hon. Member for Eastwood, will remember well. I was living in Edinburgh at the time. Between Christmas and new year's day, the roads in Edinburgh and Lothian were blocked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With pickets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, by snow. What an idiot the hon. Gentleman is. The roads were blocked by all kinds of snow, not just the wrong type. I appeared on a regular feature on Radio Forth, which broadcast a snowline. As a director of Age Concern, I gave advice to elderly people about keeping warm. I also remember the director of highways for Lothian region advising people to stay off the roads or to move cars from driveways. That incident reminds me of a thought for the day that I heard on Radio Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did my hon. Friend do that as well?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did once. I did not do a God spot—it was a type of anti-God spot. On one occasion, the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1212</span>
programme was presented by a minister, who started his sermon by saying that he was driving down the road in Edinburgh and saw a big container, signwritten, "Grit for roads". He said, "That is what we need in our lives to get through the ups and downs, the highways and byways of life. We need grit." I want to finish on that note.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: True grit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not the metaphorical grit for roads, but the true grit for roads. The regions' roads departments have done an excellent job. There is no justification for removing responsibility from them—it is just another centralising, bureaucratic proposal and an opportunity for more privatisation. When the Government talk about centralisation and privatisation I know that it is time to say no.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Later in the year there will be a full-scale consultation—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely, on a matter of this importance. There will be a full-scale consultation about the network in the second half of the year. The Government will take the views of all interested parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause does not include provision for liabilities relating to loans and loan charges to be transferred between roads authorities when trunking or detrunking takes place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Borrowing by authorities is not generally tied to specific projects or assets, and there is no automatic basis on which the transfer of any such liabilities for loans could take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Separate from trunking and detrunking arrangements, it will be open to the Government to consider whether outstanding liabilities for loans or loan charges should be transferred from authorities to central Government. That matter is being considered, but if any such liabilities are transferred, thus relieving local authorities of existing debt, there would have to be a related reduction in the Government-provided aggregate external finance for meeting such loans charges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a significant statement. Cannot the Minister give a guarantee that, all things being equal when a trunk road is taken over under the provisions, loan charges will usually be taken over as well? If that is not the case, there will be dismay in roads authorities throughout Scotland. They expect the Government to allow such takeovers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The matter is under consideration. If such action is taken, it will have an effect on the aggregate external finance provided by the Government towards meeting loan charges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to expenditure on roads and transport—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister not give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0672">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1213</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister is not giving way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall answer the hon. Gentleman's points. If he wants to question me later, he is free to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to expenditure on roads and transport, the Government have not decided the trunking and detrunking that will be required. I cannot say what, if any, implications that will have for the balance between central and local spending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is directly responsible for capital expenditure and for making capital allocations to authorities for local roads and transport. He is able to take an overall view of the distribution of resources that is appropriate, and will do so. The Government will examine how the present arrangements for capital allocations and grant can be adapted to the greater number of authorities, but the principles will not change. It will be a matter of assessing authorities' needs and responding to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about earmarking of capital allocations. I accept that with a larger number of smaller authorities it will be necessary to ensure that allocations can make provision for larger schemes. We shall ensure that appropriate arrangements are made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about staffing. The Bill does not make any specific arrangements for staffing of local roads authorities. That will be a matter for the authorities. I would not expect total numbers of road safety staff in Scotland to fall.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that staffing would be a matter for the new authorities. Tayside regional council has a direct service organisation, Tayside Contracts, which undertakes trunk road maintenance and building work for the council and the Government. There will not be a successor joint board to look after that area. When Tayside regional council ceases to exist, what will happen to that direct service organisation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In future, I expect that councils will benefit from the sharing of knowledge, information and expertise. I will ensure that the Scottish Office will continue to work to bring together bodies working in that sector. There may be fewer large teams within councils working on accident investigation and prevention at the design level, but the expertise will still be available. Councils will be able to harness it, through either co-operative working or purchasing it from the private sector. Design consultants already work effectively in analysing traffic and road problems and designing solutions. There is no reason that accident investigation and prevention work should not be procured in the same way. There are examples already of roads authorities in Scotland employing consultants with experience elsewhere in the United Kingdom, and abroad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ther will be no change in the use of Scottish Office staff. The Scottish Office will be consulted on planning applications adjacent to trunk roads. Road safety considerations will be important. The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley asked whether clause 38 would supersede section 5 of the Roads (Scotland) Act 1984. The answer is that it will not. Section 5 will remain as a permanent power to deal with more local trunking or detrunking. The powers under clause 38 are transitional.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1214</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not understand what the Minister meant by "more local" trunking or detrunking roads. How are they different from other such roads?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The changes implemented by the Bill will ensure that the boundary between national and local networks is drawn appropriately. In certain cases, that will mean many more trunk roads, but in other cases the local roads may have to be extended in certain areas. But overall, trunk roads will be extended substantially.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a local authority gives up 10 per cent. of its roads to the Scottish Office, does that mean that the Scottish Office will take on 10 per cent. more staff?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not necessarily. I did not suggest that the Scottish Office would take on 10 per cent. more staff. There would be an inevitable adjustment in funding between the Scottish Office and local authorities. I explained that the Scottish Office is in a position to employ consultants. The hon. Gentleman will know that local authorities, through agency arrangements, act at present on behalf of the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the amendment, it would be for the Secretary of State to publish any proposals for agency arrangements with the new councils by 31 December 1994. It was not practical to set out the details of the extent of the changes in the Bill. We considered it appropriate to study the routes and the functions that they serve, by setting out the changes to be made in a parliamentary order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The details should be made known by 31 December. The councils must know what networks will be under their control. They should have that information in broad terms from an early date to allow them to plan the activities that they will take on from April 1996.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the Secretary of State's intention that plans for trunking and detrunking associated with reorganisation should be published by April 1995 or shortly thereafter. Under the existing agency arrangements, local roads authorities look after the maintenance of trunk roads and plan minor improvements. Agency arrangements exist for routine maintenance such as sign cleaning, grass cutting and patching and winter maintenance such as snow clearing and gritting. There is no reason, in principle, why such arrangements should not continue after reorganisation. Practical reasons make it desirable for the Secretary of State to review his arrangements with the roads authorities, and reorganisation is an appropriate time to do that. Skills could be bought-in from consultants on behalf of the Scottish Office; another possibility is that the Scottish Office could use the private sector to provide the agency services on a route basis. We are turning, increasingly, to the management of trunk roads as a whole in recognition of their function to serve long-distance strategic traffic. We are considering procuring maintenance services on that basis, which could result in a more coherent standard of service for the road user.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the year of shadow operation will be an extremely busy time for the new councils which will have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0673">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1215</span>
much to do and to decide. It would not assist the councils if the Secretary of State were required to publish prematurely a set of proposals which could not take account of the development that I described. The Secretary of State will introduce proposals for trunking and detrunking and for agency arrangements in good time for the necessary consultation, discussion and planning. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will therefore withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That simply will not do. The Minister has not answered the questions posed by my hon. Friends the Members for East Lothian and for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley. On the matter of staffing, it is palpably not so that there is no change. Will the Minister confirm that given the transfer of some local authority functions from the Secretary of State, the Scottish roads directorate will come within the remit of the staff commission to be set up under clause 12? Is not that the position? If, as a direct result of local government reform there is an increase in the length of trunk roads, there will be a consequent need for additional Scottish Office staff to manage them. It is not true that there is no change. Just as employees will be transferred to new authorities to undertake roads duties, why should not employees be similarly transferred to the Scottish Office? When employees are transferred to the Scottish Office they should enjoy the same conditions as employees transferred to the new authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not answered those questions and that is deeply unsatisfactory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that there would be no change in staffing at local authority level. The number of staff employed on road safety work will be a matter for each council to determine. We do not expect total staff numbers in Scotland to fall; the total may rise if councils believe that there is more work to be done in tackling the problems in their areas. I said that there would be no change as far as Scottish Office staff were concerned; that remains the position—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because of their ability to form consultancy arrangements and to consider the other possibilities that I mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I gather that there is some pressure to finish our proceedings. This is a deeply unsatisfactory situation. It would be better to move the adjournment and return to the issue briefly on Thursday morning. To put it bluntly, 25 minutes to midnight is not the time to discuss this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no power to adjourn the Committee. Does the hon. Gentleman wish to continue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case I shall keep going, because there is so much to be said. I do not want to inconvenience anyone, but it is in the Government Whip's power to adjourn the Committee and that would be much better. I do not think that anyone would want to take up too much time on Thursday morning, but this time of night is not the time to consider the business before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1216</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Does the hon. Gentleman wish to move an adjournment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I am told no, I will go on. Will the Minister explain the arrangements that the Secretary of State intends to adopt for the maintenance and management of the enlarged proposed trunk road network through the continuation of local authority agency agreements, in which local roads authorities have provided an efficient and cost-effective agency service for the past 60 years? Will he confirm that the Secretary of State, in recognition of that, intends to continue local authority agency agreements for the maintenance and management of the enlarged proposed trunk road networks?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. None of the Minister's replies to my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian or to me were satisfactory. Even if we continued the debate until 5 minutes to 12 tomorrow morning, however, I doubt whether we would receive satisfactory replies. We had better accept that and realise that the Government are unable or unwilling to provide them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I shall ask three crisp questions and sit down. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> If I am laughed at I shall go on for the whole night.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first question is on a matter of fact. Will the Minister explain what arrangements are being made for the transfer of staff associated with those local roads that will be taken over as trunk roads under clause 38? That has not been answered yet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second question about matters of fact concerns section 5(5) of the Roads (Scotland) Act 1984.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have done that one</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has not been answered yet. Will the Minister confirm that that provision applies to any action by the Secretary of State relating to any local road that he considers should become a trunk road?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, will the Minister explain, given the decrease in local road length, what steps are being taken to ensure that the allocation of capital borrowing consent for roads and transport between 30 mainland authorities, compared to the current nine, will still allow significant transport projects and initiatives to proceed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand very well the circumstances of the Committee and I will leave my questions at that, but matters are profoundly unsatisfactory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend and others that the way in which the Committee is now dealing with such an important issue is hopelessly unsatisfactory. The Minister's reply suggests that matters are worse than I originally thought. He told us that there would be consultation about the details of the detrunking and other aspects of the legislation. That seems to be the hallmark of the Bill—post-legislative consultation. The Government legislate first and ask questions later. That is a ludicrous way of establishing administrative arrangements for the nation of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0674">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1217</span>
The Minister has said that he will decide on the distribution of resources and even on the detailed distribution of resources for specific projects. There will be centralisation. He says that grant-aided expenditure allocations will be earmarked by the Scottish Office. That amounts to more centralisation of decision making about local roads and more central control. Then, horror of horrors, he tells us that he will just consider the question of the transfer of liability for debts and loans associated with existing roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To take an example that the Minister and I both know well, Edinburgh city bypass is a local road. I understand that Lothian regional council has a covenant and must pay back £2 million a year for that road. If it is to be trunked, does that mean that although the Scottish Office will take over ownership, Lothian regional council will continue paying £2 million a year, for however long it may be, for the loan charge? That is monstrous, and the Minister should comment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point, to which I must insist that the Minister responds, concerns the position of the highways departments' employees. I refer to the administrative and manual staff—the people who do the work on our roads and have managed them so well for many years. Will they have the same safeguards and rights under the local government staff commission as other employees? The Minister must answer that question, and give the people concerned proper assurances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already made a statement on staff. The Bill does not deal specifically with the transfer of staff. That associated with roads will be subject to the normal principles of employment law. The allocations will of course be equitable, and as to significant transport projects, I have made it clear that the distribution of allocations to authorities will take account of local needs. Provision for larger schemes can still be made where there is a case for such schemes to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members do not fully appreciate that most maintenance and improvement work on trunk roads is carried out by regional councils on an agency basis for the Scottish Office. I make it absolutely clear that decisions on agency arrangements may be influenced by a number of factors, including trunking and detrunking proposals. I expect that the Scottish Office and shadow councils will want a clear idea of the contents of their respective networks before concluding discussions on agency arrangements. The councils may wish to consider the extent to which they will operate in co-operation with one another in procuring services. Such co-operation could be in relation to their own responsibilities, or where they propose to provide agency arrangements for the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also make it absolutely clear that maintenance of trunk roads may be on a route basis. They have been maintained by local authorities, but in future there could be an increased role for the private sector. I stress that no decisions have been taken. The Bill does not change the agency arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson), taking over the Edinburgh city bypass will, if the road is trunked, involve the Scottish Office in assuming responsibility for the covenant payments, as they are directly associated with the road. That is quite
	<span class='label label-info column'>1218</span>
different from the position on loan charges, which are not related to specific projects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister gives cause for alarm with his comments about privatisation. They have been sprinkled throughout his responses—a sort of policy on the hoof. At least, it seems like policy on the hoof from our point of view, but it has clearly been worked out by the Scottish Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the existing agency arrangements be torn up? We now hear that some or all of the maintenance of trunk roads could be contracted out or could go to the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are sick and tired of the Scottish Office wasting money on consultants in every aspect of their activities. Will the Minister clarify the rather casual comments that he made tonight about putting more of the road system out to consultants) in whatever form such consultancy may take? The Scottish Office may use agencies and operate agency arrangements, but the Government, for no other reason than a political one, are hell bent on using consultants at every opportunity. The people who do such an excellent job in our regional authorities should receive a reassurance that they will not simply be part of this free for all. Insult is added to the injury of the regional authorities, which do such an effective job, that are being dismembered, by littering consultants everywhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister commented casually that maintenance work could increasingly be put out to the private sector. What kind of nonsence is that? The Minister appears to be making it up as he goes along. If he is not, can he say more about his long-term prescription for the trunk road system which is currently handled in the main by regional councils?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a great many smaller networks are in place, it makes less sense for the council to employ the full range of specialist skills that would be needed. Those skills could be brought in from consultants on behalf of the Scottish Office. One would then have to ask whether the Scottish Office should recruit those skills directly. Those matters are under consideration and decisions have not been made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even at this late hour, it is now clear what this reorganisation is all about. It is not about the public interest or improving services. The Minister has just confirmed that dismembering local government is about giving the private sector a bigger role, regardless of the consequences for the people whom we serve in our constituencies. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, Hear."] We hear agreement from the Government Benches. That is a disgrace. We received no substantial responses to any of our questions, and at the last minute we are told that the work done in regional councils is simply to be abandoned. The Government are feather bedding private contractors regardless of the cost and consequences. That is a scandal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a shameful evening. How can the shadow councils consider their responsibilities as agent authorities in the absence of staff advice? How can the massive loss be dealt with in the winter of 1995–96, when

	<span class='label label-info column'>1219</span>
the staff will hopefully be clearing the snow? Those practical problems have not been dealt with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is beyond a joke. The Minister made painfully obvious his incapacity to reply to the debate. It is horrifying that a department run by this Minister will be in sole control of so much of Scotland's highway system. He says that he is not bothered that local authority highways departments will be dismembered, because they will continue to work on an agency basis. Where are the agents? He is in the process of sabotaging those who are doing the agency work so efficiently now. That is an alarming prospect and we will return to it on Report. Their Lordships, too, will have to return to it too. That is essential. If we fail to provide a proper framework for running the highway system in Scotland, it will be bad for our entire economy and society. Given the hopelessly inadequate reply from the Government Front Bench, I have no inclination to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
