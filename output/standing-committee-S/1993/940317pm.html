The problem with the disaggregation and the breakup of the transport policies and programmes—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend is discussing Hillfoots, may I draw it to his attention that the Minister of State of the Department of Employment, hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) held a press conference in Scotland this morning? He is about to become not the hon. Member for Stirling. The hon. Gentleman complained about the lack of consultation about the new boundaries for his constituency, and was asked by a senior Scottish journalist if that was similar to the way in which local government was being carved up. It has been reported that in response to that innocent question, the hon. Gentleman went nuclear. Perhaps he is slightly sensitive about the way in which boundaries are being decided and is embarrassed at the principle being carried to a logical conclusion, just like his career.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a perceptive intervention by my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee received a letter from the Bridge of Allan community council which is part of the Airthrey division. The Government propose that it should be put in the Clackmannan constituency, or rather the Clackmannan and Kinross constituency, as it has been recommended that it should be named.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall finish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bridge of Allan community council stated that it does not want to be disaggregated from Central region for local government purposes, but should form a unitary authority capable of providing the services that people require.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman feel qualified to speak about Stirling, given that the electors of that constituency rejected him as their Member of Parliament twice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the parliamentary boundaries of Stirling are examined, the record in Stirling is such that I can take great honour in it. The hon. Member for Stirling expected a substantial majority for the Conservatives, perhaps 10,000 in 1983. He failed to obtain that—it was 5,500, which was brought down to 548 in 1987. The significance of the boundary change, which returns the boundary to that originally recommended by the Boundary Commission before the 1981 inquiry, is that the seat is non-winnable for the hon. Member for Stirling. After 10 years, the hon. Gentleman should be filled with trepidation because people are slowly but surely finding him out. He is hanging on by a very small margin and will lose the seat by a substantial margin at the next general election. No one has to apologise for bringing down his majority from 5,500 to 548, setting up what will be a good Labour victory at the next general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall return to the question of bus routes and transport. The problem with small authorities is that while they may have flexibility, they will not have the resources or the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1264</span>
determination to provide the same transport services that the regional councils and one transport authority provide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Central regional council, which is responsible for transport, has a capital budget of £5.3 million. If that is split into two councils, as proposed, one authority will have £3.8 million and the other will have only £1.5 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The eastern radial road around Stirling, which we shall discuss in detail, costs £5.5 million, which is almost four times the total capital available to Stirling for the provision of roads and transport. The town centre car park, in revenue terms—we are talking about the revenue impact of a service—costs £4.2 million. It would put £5 on the council tax of Central region to provide the revenue costs for a decent car park in Stirling. If that were borne by Stirling district council alone, or by Stirling unitary authority, it would put £15 on the council tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch) has stepped out of the Room because he is the one pushing the idea that the authorities provide good services but want to keep down the council tax. If there were an option of putting £15 on the council tax or of not having a decent car park, I suggest that the small Tory authorities would not have the will to vote for the extra £15 on the council tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us move on to consider the concept of cross boundaries and bussing. The need to cross boundaries in the new set up will cause problems for most bus services. The example of Aberdeen is a good one. As my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) said, there will be a subsidised service within the city of Aberdeen for the elderly and for others who require to be supported in using the bus services. However, there is a Conservative authority outwith the city whose preference for low council tax and low spending per head of population suggests that the service may not be subsidised outwith the city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an annual subsidy of £3 million to the bus services in Central region. I represent the Braes area in the old mining villages of what was east Stirlingshire. There is not much transport or traffic from those villages to Falkirk or elsewhere. They only get bus services because the regional councils subsidise the operators in that area. It will be difficult to find that £3 million in Stirling as it is clear from the latest budget that it prefers to reduce its council tax, even if that means that service charges must increase. The example in its budget was a 300 per cent, increase in some leisure charges and a 200 per cent, increase in others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that approach and that mentality, we have serious doubts about whether the small authority, which may be controlled by the Conservatives and have a different ideology from that of the present regional councils, will continue to subsidise buses. The amendment would make the Secretary of State accept that concern. We want the Minister to accept that concern today and to say that he understands the need for a unitary passenger transport authority for each regional council area to protect the people who require the services, but who cannot rely on the councils that will be set up to actually deliver them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In terms of operation and of the costs in time and money to the operators, there are 41 cross-boundary bus
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0702">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1265</span>
services currently registered in Central region. If the Government disaggregate the councils to the two proposed councils, the number of cross-boundary bus routes in central Scotland alone will increase to 105. Will Falkirk, as the largest population area, carry the largest burden of the increased bureaucracy and payments that will have to be made from one authority to another? Or, as my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley said, will preferential journeys be considered? People like to travel to Callander and to walk up Ben A'an, Ben Vorlich, Ben Ledi and the other Bens in the area, which is lovely to do, but they might have to be charged for that. Will the people of Stirling subsidise the journeys made in the Stirling area? Will Stirling unitary authority subsidise the journey from the bus station in Stirling to Alloa or to the hills in Callander? Or will people who come from outwith be told, "No, you can use your bus pass to come into Stirling, but do not try to use it to get out of Stirling and go into other areas."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a constituency Member of Parliament, I have had to deal with the good example of a gentleman from my area—the Polmont area outside Falkirk—who likes to walk and to go up to the north of Stirling. Therefore, he must travel by train from Polmont station to Glasgow Queen street where he takes the Fort William train and alights at Tyndrum, and he walks around that area. As he breaks his journey in Strathclyde and he is from Central region, he must pay for his journey from Queen street to Tyndrum. At one time he could use his pass, but it was then discovered that he was crossing two boundaries and starting a journey in Strathclyde. He was deeply saddened, but accepted that Strathclyde has enough to do looking after the massive number of people in Strathclyde. I believe that he has given up going to Tyndrum and now goes to Callander instead, because that is in Central region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the future, if that gentleman travelled from Polmont to Stirling, presumably he would have to pay from Stirling if he wanted to go to Callander. That would be a denial of a service currently available to him. I doubt whether anyone is confident that we shall have from the Stirling authority the service across the boundary that is currently provided by the Central region authority. That is the simple issue that we put to the Minister. We have a problem. We do not trust the Tory councils to deliver the service at the level currently delivered by the regional councils; if we could, the amendment would be unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the measure is about local government reorganisation, let us keep to it. If it is about threatening the services for the elderly and those who require subsidised bus transport and decent transport policies, which the regions currently provide. Let us do something to protect those people. The way to do that is by having a passenger transport authority for each of the regions as they stand at present. We should not leave the matter to chance. People should be given the confidence that the measure will look after future services and that it will not involve the kind of flexibility that will lead to poorer services. The Minister should recognise that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tain Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Scotrail franchise is planned to commence in the spring of 1995. How will the Government ensure that the extent of Strathclyde passenger transport executive's involvement is made
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1266</span>
known before bids for the franchise are invited? The PTE will determine the standards for services that it supports, so it must know the extent of its obligations. As consultation on the Strathclyde PTA will not commence until the spring of 1995, a decision on its area is unlikely before the summer of 1995. I should also like Mr. Hetherington to pay attention. Does this—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member should not refer to anyone in this Room other than members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that leave sufficient time for all the necessary staff changes and liaison on joint working to enable new arrangements to be effective from April 1996?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to respond to the many questions that were asked in the debate, which has concentrated on concessionary fares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) spoke of cross-boundary bus services. I see no need for additional PTAs to be set up to provide such services. The new councils will be able to co-operate to ensure the continuation of socially necessary bus services that cross boundaries. Most bus services are provided commercially—some 85 per cent, of those in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authority powers on transport were mentioned. The hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) asserted that there was no possibility of local authorities getting together. That is totally incorrect. Local authorities' powers in relation to transport will be unchanged by the changes in local government units. If powers require to be exercised jointly by authorities—for example, on concessionary travel—there is no reason why they cannot be. That is what currently applies and will apply in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Outside the PTA area, the single-tier authorities will be able to decide what concessionary travel arrangements to provide and whether they wish to co-operate with one another in providing concessions over wider areas than local authority areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members have raised the question of guarantees. There are no guarantees now and we do not believe that the details of concessionary fares should be prescribed in legislation. Locally elected representatives should work out the details at local level. Apparently, Conservative Members have greater faith in local democracy than Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard extremely good speeches from my hon. Friends the Members for Ayr (Mr. Gallie), for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) and for Kincardine and Deeside. I stress that local authorities can at present join together to provide schemes. My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South made an excellent speech on local democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important section is section 93(1)G) of the Transport Act 1985. Under that section authorities can join together and there is every reason to suppose that they should do so. It specifically relates to concessionary
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0703">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1267</span>
travel schemes to assist travel by certain persons, such as the elderly, disabled, students, children and blind persons. The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) referred to concessionary fares for taxi cab schemes. That is a matter for local democracy and if there is a will there will certainly be a way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman seems to think that people put forward proposals when they stand for election on the basis of doing away with essential services. Like me, he was a councillor. Councillors get elected if it is thought that they will deliver to the local electorate the best possible services with value for money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was also asked about rail services. I can tell the hon. Member for Fife, Central that authorities outside the PTA area can become involved in assisting rail developments through capital funding, such as the opening of new stations. That has happened in Lothian, and I have recently announced extra allocations to improve the Fife to Edinburgh services, which has been welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have to say to the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) that a PTA is not necessary in Lothian because the authorities have the powers to co-operate in joint arrangements. In any case, most of the urban transport issues can be dealt with satisfactorily by the new Edinburgh authority, and other matters can be the subject of appropriate co-operation between authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member of Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) raised the issue of the financing of another Forth crossing. The feasibility study on a possible new Forth crossing is continuing and the results will be published. There is no question of local authorities being involved in the funding of a new bridge. Any new Forth crossing, including approach roads, would be funded by private finance, but no decision has been made on the key issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that a new crossing will be totally funded by private finance. Does that mean that the infrastructure will receive no financing from Scottish Office central funds?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, about 50 per cent, of the proposals in the whole package relate to other matters, such as park-and-ride, a possible railway stop near the airport, associated bus services and so on. Associated projects will be made public when the results of the feasibility study are published. Thereafter we will make our position clear. But a decision has not yet been made on that subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The bridge and approach roads to which the hon. Gentleman referred would be funded by private finance were the proposal to go ahead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend the Minister aware that in its recent report on Scotland's transport links, the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs identified the urgent need for a second crossing over the Forth?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is considerable evidence that the traffic levels are increasing so much that something must be done.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend that a modern, competitive infrastructure is beneficial for jobs. A decision about the air-road route, which my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr and the hon.

Friend makes a valid point. Too often, the discussion about whether there should be a second Forth crossing centres around commuters to Edinburgh. Hon.

The smooth crossing of the Forth is very important for people further north.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are going a bit wide of the passenger transport authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend tempts me further, I shall answer another of his questions about the Scotrail franchise. The passenger transport executive's role in rail franchising is set out in the Railways Act 1993. The passenger transport executive will set the level of service along with the franchising director. Therefore, the passenger transport executive's role is a strong one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I put one question? Which authorities have joined together for the purposes of concessionary travel schemes under present arrangements?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under the present legislation, any authority can do that. The hon. Gentleman will have to make inquiries about each authority's detailed arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me give the answer. It is none, as the Minister knows.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall check up on what the hon. Gentleman has said. I shall inform him later whether he is correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important matters have been raised. Opposition Members expressed a genuine anxiety about the fairness of future allocations to smaller authorities where road projects stretch from one authority to another. As I have said, a larger number of smaller authorities will make it necessary to make certain that allocations can provide for larger schemes. We shall put appropriate arrangements in place. Also, I stress that we will be able to earmark allocations if necessary. In general, our policy is to allow

authorities maximum discretion, but that option is available if it becomes absolutely necessary.

The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley asked about the consultation procedure for the PTA. I assure him that all interested parties, including the shadow authorities, will be consulted on proposals to be set out in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that the Elderly Forum, its local groups, Age Concern groups and others concerned with the care of the elderly will be involved in the consultation? Will he give the Committee some idea of the timetable? He said that the process will start when the shadow authorities take over. Can we have an assurance that it will be completed speedily?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it will be dealt with speedily in accordance with the usual precedents on consultations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about the elderly groups?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was a director of Age Concern, so it is appropriate that he should raise that issue. Yes, they will be consulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have held a debate on concessionary fares. I am glad to have been able to give the assurances that the Committee wants, because those assurances will ensure that all elected authorities in Scotland will be able to maintain concessionary fares every bit as strongly in the future as they did in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The assurances are hardly worth the paper that they are written on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, they are not written down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The PTE cannot satisfy its franchise requirements until it knows the extent of the network for which it will be responsible. The PTE must know that before the spring of 1995 when the franchise is awarded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also raised the question of the Forth crossing, which interests me because the south end of the crossing is in my constituency. He stated that feasibility studies will be available for scrutiny. Will they include information on likely toll levels?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The whole subject will be considered. I genuinely cannot give the hon. Gentleman an idea because the premise on which his question is based suggests that the Government have already come to a view and have made a decision. I have already said that that is not the case. We will have to consider the structure of finance with the greatest possible care and every detail will be examined before a final decision is reached.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I give the Minister a little friendly advice. If he wants to represent a constituency including Queensferry, he will make decisions soon. There are priorities for expenditure in Scotland other than that of going ahead with a second road crossing. Its opponents represent a cross-section of Scottish opinion. Nowhere

are they more adamant in their opposition than we are in West Lothian.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Gentleman says is improper. He is suggesting that national decisions should be made on the basis of the particular interests of a particular Member of Parliament in Scotland. That is immoral. The Government will not submit to such an argument. We shall consider the issues objectively and come to a decision in due course. I stress that strongly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of us think that the decision will be in contractors' interests, not the national interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was interesting that the Minister should tell us that decisions should not be made on the basis of an individual hon. Member's or Minister's interests. We believe that the reorganisation of local government is in the interests of the Minister who represents Eastwood. That is why all of the services are being reorganised. It is being done in the interests of that Minister, the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), who is unfortunately absent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister told us that his assurances were not worth the paper on because they were verbal. This is an interesting point, but it fails to take account of the fact that 	<i>Hansard</i> will record those verbal assurances. They will then, presumably, be worth the paper that they are written on. I do not know how the Minister intends to square that circle. No doubt, he will clarify that later. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have asked the hon. Member for Linlithgow before not to communicate from the Committee to those in the Public Gallery. That is out of order. As a leading Member of Parliament, will he set an example?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take it that the record will show that that remark was not addressed to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to pursue the issue of how local authorities will come together to fund concessionary fares and the PTAs. I understand that local authorities will be free to come together, but how will bills be allocated between different authorities? The Minister said that authorities are free to come together but if they fail to agree it will be for the Secretary of State to determine. It would be helpful if he could say how he intends to pursue that issue and to take the decision should that situation occur.

In our debate on the allocation of costs between the police and the fire authorities, the Minister said that provision is
	<br><blockquote><p>"determined by the location of officers, civilians, buildings, vehicles or equipment in the different geographical divisions"—	<i>[Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 15 March 1994; c. 1178]</p></blockquote>
Does the Minister believe that that same principle should apply in the passenger transport authorities? In circumstances where the major bus and railway stations are in Glasgow, they might end up with a disproportionate share of costs being allocated to one particular authority
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0705">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1271</span>
as distinct from the other. Every authority in those circumstances has a direct financial interest in minimising the expense that it incurs and maximising the expense incurred by everyone else. I am not sure how the decision-making process will work in those circumstances. In the Strathclyde passenger transport authority there will be 11 authorities—unless more are to be created—each of which will have a direct interest in minimising the cost to themselves and maximising the cost to their neighbours, even though collectively they want to ensure that the best provision is made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister clarify for me whether he believes that decisions should be taken in those circumstances by majority voting or by qualified majority voting? What will happen if only 10 authorities can reach an agreement about a financial package to fund the transport arrangements and the concessionary fares?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I understood the hon. Gentleman correctly, he was worried about where the nerve centre of any operation will be. It may assist the hon. Gentleman to know that the international headquarters of Stagecoach is in Perth, and the United Kingdom operations are controlled from there. That does not present any problems in operating the services required throughout the United Kingdom or in Malawi.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is helpful to hear that Malawi's bus services are run from Perth. Presumably there is no concessionary fare scheme operating between the two places—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Indeed, cross-continent. No doubt we shall discuss interplanetary bus services in a moment. I do not want to be diverted down that byway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Commuters between Monklands and Glasgow, for example, obviously start in one place and end in the other. Is it reasonable in such circumstances that each authority should pay half the cost of a subsidy for that link. In that case, Glasgow would end up paying half of every authority's commuter traffic, which would be a disproportionately large share of the overall burden. What will happen if there is a disagreement about the allocation? The Minister owes it to the Committee to explain whether there will be qualified majority voting within the Strathclyde passenger transport authority. How will disputes be resolved? If the dispute cannot be resolved internally, what principles will the Minister use when it goes to him for decision, as he said it might very well?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same applies to concessionary travel. How will bills and burdens be allocated? How will the Minister deal with the balance between car parking charges and concessionary fares and bus fares generally? Clearly, the actions of individual authorities in establishing particular levels of parking charges can act either as an incentive or a disincentive to public transport use. How does the Minister intend to take that into account? How does he believe individual authorities will react when either their grant or their overall budget is cut? What will happen when a balance or an agreement is struck between authorities and voluntarily entered into and the Government step in to cut the grant so that one authority finds itself financially unable to meet its share of the burden? What happens in those circumstances? Does the whole edifice collapse? Will a new reorganisation have to take place? Does the Minister determine the allocation,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1272</span>
and incur greater costs for an individual authority than it is willing to bear? If a breakdown occurs and the Minister can determine the share of the cost that individual authorities should bear—which might be greater than the costs that democratically elected authorities are prepared to pay—that is centralisation. How does the Minister square that with the claim that he is giving greater flexibility to individual authorities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by paying tribute to the excellent campaigning work of Strathclyde Elderly Forum, and especially to Linda Martin, the press and publicity person, who learned her obviously expert skills when she worked with me for Community Service Volunteers. We should give credit to Community Service Volunteers, which is a wonderful organisation, for training Linda Martin. That has led to a Government concession on concessionary fares.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In our discussion about clause 40 we have stumbled on another group of casualties. There are no guarantees for elderly people or those with special needs in Scotland. The Minister has stated that there can be no guarantees for nearly 1.2 million people in Scotland. That is a tragedy. The Government try to camouflage the issue. We are moving towards 30 unitary councils, which have transport powers, but no guarantees are provided for any of the councils' constituents outwith the PTA. That includes areas such as Fife, Highlands and Borders, which may not change. There is no guarantee that concessionary fares will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are sick and tired of hearing the Minister say, "I hope that something will emerge. Voluntarism can work". Surely we owe it to the people of Scotland, especially pensioners, to state in the Bill that they will retain the services that exist, wherever they live, when the crazy reorganisation is implemented. We have not received that guarantee. The Government have made no effort to allay people's fears. It is deplorable that that remains the case after three to four hours of discussion in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have missed another point about concessionary travel. In Fife, the Stagecoach operators, who provide a good service, receive a total income of £14 million. Fife regional council provides £7 million of that sum. The company receives 50 per cent, of its income in a cheque from the council. That provides stability for the company in Fife. The £7 million covers concessionary travel, transport for children, social work provision and concessions for the unemployed. There would be no bus services without the subsidy from Fife regional council. That is the important link between concessionary travel and the operation of a fare-paying service for every passenger, young or old. We are not considering what a Tory would describe as a "soft concession" to people in our communities. We are considering life or death assistance to older people and those with special needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not finished the point. We are considering essential income for every fare-charging passenger service in Scotland. The Government ignore that at their peril.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to the fears of old people around the country. Does he accept that he

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1273</span>
is kindling fears in those people through his refusal to accept that concessions that are now organised by local government will be continued by future local government bodies? There should be no fear because the new local authorities are more than likely to continue them. All that the hon. Gentleman is doing is kindling fears in people in whom it is not right to kindle fear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only real fear that is emerging in the Committee today is fear about the Government's failure to build into the new structure guarantees of existing services for older people. Let us not forget that when they talk about the provision of concessionary fares schemes by local authorities, they really mean their provision by regional councils. The Government are about to butcher those, so let us not have any pretence and crocodile tears from the Conservative Benches. The matter is simple. The Government can give no guarantee to us or to the old people concerned that places such as Stirling and Kyle and Carrick will be able to provide integrated facilities such as those provided by Fife region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be happy if the Minister told me that I had got it all wrong, and guaranteed that every scheme that now runs in Scotland will still run following this crazy reorganisation. We should accept that, because it would be in writing as an honourable statement of the Government's belief in concessionary fares.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend make sure that any verbal assurances that he obtains from the Minister are written-verbal assurances are not just verbal-verbal ones?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will extend my concern to that point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Govan. I do not think that we mind whether an assurance that is written into the record is delivered verbally or whether we later receive a written assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will not take lectures from Conservative Members about fears. Real fears exist. Strathclyde Elderly Forum has been here lobbying this week. It has partly secured, for part of Strathclyde, the future of concessionary travel. However, the Government can dispel fears by telling us and the people of Scotland that they are unfounded. They simply cannot do that, because older people will be subject to the free-for-all surrounding reorganisation. Our amendments were intended to persuade the Government to put on the record their commitment to older people and their travel services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman that change always brings with it fear. People become terribly worried at the prospect of change. I welcome the fact that people came here to lobby us. That is how Parliament should function. What is more, we should listen to them. However, I remind the hon. Gentleman that he expressed many fears when Stagecoach acquired the Fife bus company, Fife Scottish. I hope that he will acknowledge that many of the fears that he expressed have failed to be realised. He was not putting them quite as clearly as others did. I do not criticise him for that. He was representing the views of his then constituents, as he understood them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Fears were expressed in many respects, as well as trade union concerns and Fife regional concerns, and a successful operation emerged in Fife. So, I make no
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1274</span>
apologies for expressing the views of my constituents, whether young or old, about change. Fife has a good bus operation, but the hon. Member for Tayside, North will appreciate the point that I made earlier, that an injection of £7 million helps the stability of a service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition have, as is usual in this Committee, taken the lead and tried to obtain vital assurances. We have failed to obtain any guarantees or assurances about the extension of the PTA idea or the guarantee of concessionary fares. Those two points will return to haunt the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the bridge, the hon. Member for Linlithgow and I are the only two Committee members who will be concerned with it, because I am a Fife Member and my hon. Friend is from west Lothian. Many statements have been made in committee, and the Government could clear up much doubt today by agreeing to a public inquiry into the second road bridge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am making a point. The Minister can allay the fears on all sides of the argument by setting up a public inquiry. Why does he not do that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon McMaster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to speak in this debate, but a few moments ago I met in the Corridor an agile and fit person who benefits from the London travel scheme. He has a deep knowledge of the origins of the travel permit that he is lucky enough to have. He told me that when the Bill deregulating transport was being discussed a campaign organised by London pensioners sent a massive number of letters to the Conservative Members in that Committee. The letters said that any Bill to deregulate transport in London had to contain a clause guaranteeing concessionary travel for all pensioners. The pressure on those Conservative Members became so intense that they approached the then Secretary of State for Transport, Nicholas Ridley. They told him that unless the Bill contained such a clause they would vote for a Labour clause that had the same effect. In the end, the appropriate clause was included in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since then, the Greater London council has been abolished. As a result, somebody somewhere pays the subsidy for the pensioner's travel card. A mandatory scheme may apply to all London boroughs. London has a population of 8 million. Scotland has a population of 5 million. So it is not fair to compare London with Glasgow or Edinburgh. The comparison, with regard to the concessionary scheme, has to be with the whole of Scotland. Any concessionary scheme offered in Strathclyde would have to be offered across the whole of Scotland, as pensioners in London are able to travel throughout the whole London Transport area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The person to whom I spoke—I hesitate to call him a pensioner as he is a fit, agile and intelligent human being. [HON. MEMBERS: "Name him."] No, it would be more than my job is worth. There is speculation that it is my hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow (Mr. Dixon), but I cannot comment on that. The Minister must assure the Committee that pensioners in Scotland, not just those

That is typical of Opposition Members: they spread fears to strengthen their arguments, many of which have almost no foundation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, Central was wrong to suggest that the bridge across the Forth affected only his constituents and those of the hon. Member for Linlithgow. The hon.

turn its back on the existing excellent schemes. Those schemes could be improved. I like to think that my constituents, with an improved local authority structure, will get better schemes in the longer term.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems like a very long time since I opened the debate. I wish that we could have made more progress and extracted more information from the Minister in such an important debate. You said, Mr. Martin, that we should leave the subject of the bridge. If we could have scope for the establishment of a passenger transport authority for the south east of Scotland or for the Edinburgh conurbation, we could leave the subject of the bridge. By increasing public transport and the availability of rail passenger transport, there would be no need to waste money in wrecking more of Scotland's environment by constructing a second Forth road bridge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome clause 40, as far as it goes. We are keen that there should be a Strathclyde passenger transport authority. Indeed, we greatly welcome Government amendment No. 481, which guarantees the retention of concessions for pensioners and disabled people travelling in Strathclyde. I and my hon. Friends from outside as well as from inside Strathclyde are worried and bitterly disappointed by the Minister's refusal to consider new clause 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ayr said that he understood that the Minister had not ruled out the possibility of developing a passenger transport authority and thought that the Minister might be prepared to consider it in future. I am afraid that the Minister did no such thing. He is rejecting the new clause, and that rejection rules out any possibility of establishing its proposals in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish that the Minister had said that. When he replies, he might be able to say something like that. We have time because we do not have to vote on new clause 4 today—it appears later in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a fairly predictable political debate about the relative merits of low budget and high budget local authorities and about where the balance between cost and services should lie. However, I submit that one serious error lies behind all Conservative Members speeches. They are under the happy illusion that the Bill provides the new local authorities with flexibility and freedom. It does not. They keep asserting that the new smaller rural local authorities can maintain and develop concessionary travel schemes for elderly and disabled people. That is transparently not the case. Would to God that it were.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Three elementary considerations must be taken into account. First, the distances are longer in large rural areas. Secondly, the smaller communities mean that smaller numbers of passengers will be transported, so there will be higher costs. Thirdly, the smaller authorities will have fewer resources. It will be difficult for the new authorities to sustain schemes for pensioners in rural Tayside, rural

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1277</span>
Grampian, rural Central and, the area about which I am most concerned, rural Lothian region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not the end of the story. The new boundaries with nominally autonomous authorities will provide massive complications in organising cross-boundary concessionary fares schemes. The position in Lothian at the moment is pretty straightforward. Lothian regional council serves the entire area and operates a concessionary fare of 30p per journey, no matter how long or short, anywhere in the region. Therefore, a pensioner can get on a bus and go to another part of Edinburgh for 30p, or can get on a bus in Dunbar, in the east of my constituency, and go to Bathgate, in the west of the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow, for 30p.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Bill there will be three new authorities covering that area. It is unlikely that Edinburgh will be keen on subsidising travel outside the city, as the subsidy for concessionary travel within the city is much lower than that for travel outside it. Leaving that aside, there is the question of the administration and negotiations between the bus companies and the different local authorities about how the schemes will be set up. The bus company will have to collect subsidies from three authorities for that journey from Dunbar to Bathgate, which will be complicated. Therefore, there is a strong case for a PTE framework for the Edinburgh, Lothian and Fife area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has done his research carefully, but is he trying to tell the Committee that pensioners would normally make the kind of journey that he has just described? My experience is that pensioners are more concerned with getting from where they live to hospitals and to shops, including big shopping conurbations. They rarely travel from one constituency to another because that does not meet their objectives. I know something of using buses and of how buses are used. The hon. Gentleman is perhaps overstating his case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A benefit of the concessionary fare scheme is that pensioners travel to visit relations and friends in other regions because travel is so reasonably priced. There is evidence of that. I accept that the numbers may not be great, but a very high proportion of concessionary fare journeys from among my constituents go into Edinburgh, which will mean crossing a new boundary. My constituents will need to cross a new boundary to get to the hospitals, to the shops and to other facilities. It is not unlikely that a significant number of journeys will cross two or more of the new boundaries, so life is likely to be quite complicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far we have concentrated on buses, but it is important also to consider access to section 20 funding for the development of rail services across the area. I make the point again that the Edinburgh conurbation is the largest conurbation in the United Kingdom without a PTE. It must be the next candidate on the list for a PTE. I am all the more worried because the Government appear to be slamming the door on that idea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members have strongly supported the case for flexibility. They have said that it is important that the new local authorities have complete freedom to do what they think best. I completely agree. I invite Conservative Members to read new clause 4:
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1278</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may, on an application in that regard by two or more local authorities, by order establish a passenger transport authority".</p></blockquote>
It goes on to provide the details of that. What could be more flexible? No one is forcing the Secretary of State or a local authority to do anything. The proposal creates the possibility of local authorities getting together to make an application to the Scottish Office to establish a passenger transport executive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has rightly accepted the case for retaining the Strathclyde PTE. We welcome that. It is good news for commuters, travellers and, especially, pensioners and disabled people in that area. But he appears to be slamming the door on even the possibility of a passenger transport executive for Lothian or other parts of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Strathclyde pensioners will have their integrated concessionary fare scheme protected, but those in Lothian will not. That is not scaremongering: it is fact. At present, 135,000 pensioners in Lothian have concessionary travel cards with which they make 33 million trips a year. It will not be possible to retain the integrated scheme across three local authorities. [HON. MEMBERS: "Why not?"] It may be possible, but it will be extremely difficult and pensioners in Midlothian, East Lothian and West Lothian are not likely to receive the same benefits as at present. In addition, there is no prospect of developing co-ordinated rail services as in Strathclyde even though that will be safeguarded under clause 40.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is there this discrimination between Strathclyde and other parts of Scotland? It is bad news for pensioners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman recall the setting up of the passenger transport authority in the west of Scotland? Originally, it was not set up under Strathclyde, but by Glasgow corporation in conjunction with the local authorities around it. On that basis, there is hope for those in Lothian.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am genuinely grateful to the hon. Gentleman. The city fathers in Glasgow set the ball rolling. That is why we have the PTE in Strathclyde. Thankfully, the Government will allow that to continue. However, I am disturbed by the fact that the Minister is slamming the door on the possibility of establishing an equivalent PTE for the Edinburgh conurbation or anywhere else in Scotland. The hon. Gentleman is not a fair man, but he is drifting in the right direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that the Minister must stick to his brief and I have been around long enough not to expect Conservative Members to vote against Ministers in mis Committee or anywhere else. However, for the life of me, I cannot see why the Government are taking such a hard line on the new clause. It will not give rise to any expense; it will not

impose an inescapable duty on local authorities, on the Scottish Office or anyone else; it makes it possible for other parts of Scotland to have the same framework as Strathclyde.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Happily, we do not have to make a decision now. The vote on new clause 4 will come much later in our proceedings. Therefore, we have a little breathing space. I make one final appeal to the Minister, to whom I have spoken privately so that he has had some time to consider it. Please, will he agree to meet me and one or two officials from Lothian region who are responsible for providing theservices so that we can discuss the case for leaving the door open for future use? I do not want him to destroy the prospect of there ever being a passenger transport authority to cover Lothian or any other part of Scotland under the legislation. I make that final appeal to leave the door open.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As an addendum to my earlier contribution, I should like to say that I was fortunate enough in the Corridor to bump into the agile, intelligent, fit, mature, older person whom I had spoken to earlier. He gave me a copy of the leaflet that comes with that travel card. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where and when you can use your permit</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>On the London Underground and Docklands Light Railway: Your permit entitles you to free travel on all Underground and Docklands Light Railway trains from 9 am Monday to Fridays until the last train and any time on Saturdays, Sundays and Public Holidays.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>On London Transport Bus Services: Your permit entitles you to FREE travel on all bus services that are part of London Transport's network …</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>On British Rail: Your permit entitles you to half price cheap day returns on British Rail trains between any stations in the London area…It is not possible to travel half price beyond that area."</p></blockquote>
So it is contained in London.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Half price cheap day returns are available from 9.30 am Monday to Fridays until the last train and any time on Saturdays, Sundays and Public Holidays. You may also be accompanied by up to 4 children … at a maximum fare of £1 each."</p></blockquote>
That is the deal that London pensioners get, all 8 million of them. Will the Minister give us an assurance that the 5 million Scots who will, I hope, become pensioners at some point in their lives will get the same deal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be a matter for local democracy, as I have said many times. Opposition Members do not seem to have much confidence in local democracy.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. Let me finish this point. At present there are no joint concessionary travel schemes, but many authorities offer cross-boundary concessions on their own account. Fife region allows members of its scheme some concessions for travel to areas outside Fife, such as Edinburgh. We anticipate that there will be much joint co-operation, which will be in the interest of those concerned in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Fife scheme involves older people in Fife and those with special needs. This nonsense about cross boundaries is irrelevant. The scheme is available to Fife people in one significant regional council area. The Minister seems to forget that that is the issue that we are pressing. Small councils will not be able to provide the same level of concessionary support as Fife region.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Authorities will have the same powers as the PTA and they will be able to co-ordinate and come to agreements for joint arrangements without the need for that to be laid down in statute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Several hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to answer the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Davidson) who asked about expenditure. The expenditure of the PTA must be met by its constituent councils in so far as it is not met otherwise. Overall funding has to be provided. The councils can agree among themselves on the proportions in which expenditure will be met by them. If they cannot agree, the Secretary of State has the power to determine the proportions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The bus station in Glasgow is of great benefit not only to those who live in Glasgow, but to those who travel in and around Glasgow in a very wide area. It is fair for the PTA's expenditure to be shared. The Secretary of State will step in only if the authorities fail to agree on how the PTA's costs should be shared.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Walsh) said that it was iniquitous that the Secretary of State should have powers to choose the chairman. In the next group there is an amendment to take away that power, so action is being taken on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I concede that, but the Secretary of State included the powers in the Bill originally and obviously intended to impose them. The Minister has just said that the Government "anticipate" that cross-boundary concessions will go ahead. On what grounds does he anticipate such agreements will take place, apart from pious hope? What consultations has he had on this matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously local authorities have to be responsive to the interests of local democracy.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I want to answer the points that have been made. The hon. Member for Govan raised the issue of expenditure and I want to go into that in a little more detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The constituent councils are required to meet the PTA's expenditure. The hon. Gentleman's point is somewhat unreal. The PTA's expenditure is based on the needs of the constituent councils inside the PTA. Central Government support to local authorities is running at high levels: it is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0710">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1281</span>
about 85 per cent, of local authority expenditure. The needs of the councils will be expressed in the formula to which I referred earlier based on the methodology that will be agreed with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. That process will determine the level of needs and thus the reasonable expenditure on public transport by the PTA for the PTA area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Govan wanted to know whether there would be majority voting. I anticipate that that will be a sensible way forward, but I gave a commitment in Committee this morning that we will consult on the membership and the constitution of the PTA. The hon. Gentleman's point will be covered in that process. I envisage that the procedure will be broadly the same as it is now. As the hon. Member for Fife, Central knows, Fife regional council is the PTA and it will make the decisions on public transport matters in accordance with its usual voting procedures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly confused about what the Minister means when he says that the make up of the PTA will be broadly the same as it is now. Everyone on it now is from Strathclyde, but that will cease to exist. Will the representation on the PTA be in line with electorates? That is the only parallel that I can think of. If it is to be in line with electorates, that would be a clear indication of what the Minister intends and that would be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Minister can give us assurances but they are meaningless. Will he give us a guarantee that pensioners in the whole of Scotland will get at least the same deal as pensioners in London? Will he give us a guarantee that at least the same level of per capita expenditure will be available to finance that scheme? The Minister may not know the answers to those questions, so will he give us a guarantee that he will write to every member of the

The purpose of amendment No. 415 is to remove the Secretary of State from involvement in the appointment of the chairman of the Strathclyde PTA about which the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) was so concerned this morning. That aligns the appointment arrangements with those of PTAs in England and Wales. Therefore, I hope that the Opposition will agree that amendment No. 446 is unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 3 prohibits members, officers or employees of the Strathclyde passenger transport executive, or any employee of a subsidiary of the PTE, from being appointed members of the PTA. Existing members who also become involved with the PTE or a subsidiary are also required to vacate membership of the PTA Amendment No. 254 inserts an appropriate reference to the executive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 255 would ensure the option of the Strathclyde PTE providing for the accommodation of the PTA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 15 provides power to appoint deputies to act in the absence of a member of the new PTA. Amendment No. 256 would ensure that both members and any

deputies will be appointed by the constituent councils of the new PTA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 257 and 258 would ensure that provision may be made for the PTA to appoint staff and pay them remuneration and allowances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 259 would enable the Secretary of State in any order relating to the constitution and membership of the new Strathclyde PTA to make suitable provision for the superannuation of any officers and staff employed by the new authority.

I recommend the Government amendments to the Committee.

I should stress that amendment No. 415 makes the Opposition's amendment No. 446 unnecessary because it covers the same point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A number of detailed references have been made to the rights of the staff of the Strathclyde PTA. Earlier in our proceedings, we debated the eligibility of local authority employees to stand for election to local authorities.

Government new clause 31—	<i>Guarantees by Strathclyde Passenger Transport Authority.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is a clarifying amendment that is designed to avoid ambiguity and to make clear that all the financial liabilities of the new Strathclyde PTA, except where otherwise met, shall be met by the local authorities wholly or partly within the passenger transport area of the new PTA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 423 is a straightforward drafting amendment consequent upon amendment No. 422.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 424 repeats the terms of the existing provision, that where the authorities concerned cannot reach agreement on apportioning the expenditure of the new PTA, the authority may apply to the Secretary of State for a resolution of the matter. It also creates a power to enable the Secretary of State to step in to resolve such disagreement upon his own initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The power created by the amendment is designed to meet exceptional circumstances in which prolonged disagreement may create uncertainty over the continuing operations of the new PTA and of the PTE.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is proper that, under the proposed arrangements, the business of apportioning the costs as between the constituent councils should be the business of the councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State's power to apportion payments would be used only where such an agreement cannot be arrived at. It is not the intention of the Scottish Office to intervene in matters which it considers as falling within the scope of the constituent councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0713">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1287</span>
The Secretary of State's powers would be exercised only where it appears to him that deadlock threatens public transport operations in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of amendment No. 425 is to enable the Bill's long title accurately to reflect new clause 31, which enables the PTA to guarantee any obligation entered into by the Strathclyde PTE with the approval of the authority. The amendment is straightforward and consequential, and does not extend the Bill's scope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of new clause 31 is that the existing and the new PTAs are able to guarantee, and therefore stand fully behind, obligations which the PTE enters into with the approval of the PTA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill already provides that the authority shall have power to make grants to the executive for any purpose, and that that mirrors the existing relations between Strathclyde regional council as PTA and the PTE. In particular, the new clause dispels any uncertainty over obligations that the PTE may, with the approval of the PTA, wish to enter into; they may extend over a number of years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will agree that the provision, which leaves undisturbed the distinct policy-making and funding roles of the PTA and the operational purposes of the PTE, will add usefully to the ability of both to achieve their public transport goals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 425 is a straightforward provision that will enable the new PTA to guarantee obligations of the PTE to come into effect from the date at which the Bill receives Royal Assent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of amendment No. 426 is to enable the new clause dealing with PTA guarantees to come into force immediately the Bill receives Royal Assent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will see the sense in allowing the provision to take effect at the earliest possible time to enable guarantees to be given by the PTA as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should explain to the Committee that there has been a debate on the subject because there was a difference of opinion as to the legal advice of the lenders to Strathclyde and of the Scottish Office. We are certain that the amendments deal with the points made by all concerned. They have been checked by the lawyers, which should ensure that the funding should come through effectively and that the points made to me by Councillor Malcolm Waugh and his colleagues have been dealt with. Lombards bank has been fully involved in the negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have attended two meetings on the subject with Councillor Waugh and the Minister for Public Transport. I believe that the points that were raised have been dealt with effectively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I whole-heartedly welcome what the Minister said about the constructive outcome of his meetings with Councillor Waugh, but he must be acknowledged as one of Parliament's great optimists. He said that the Secretary of State does not intend to intervene to determine the allocation of costs between local authorities within the Strathclyde passenger transport authority. The Bill creates a recipe for division and conflict by instituting 12 new local authorities within
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1288</span>
the boundaries of the passenger transport authority but the Minister expresses the pious hope that there will be no disagreements about who pays what towards the authority's costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One example that hits me between the eyes arises from some of the boundaries that we discussed under schedule 1. What about Helensburgh? It derives a lot of benefit from the Strathclyde passenger transport executive and its subsidised rail services, yet Helensburgh is to be detached from Dumbarton and attached to Argyll. Strathclyde spreads costs all over the place: I imagine that people in Tiree, Coll, Mull and the other islands do not feel too badly about contributing to the Strathclyde cake because they get their own benefits from it. However, with the much smaller authority of Argyll and Bute, what are the people on the islands going to think about subsidising the narrow package of rail services for Helensburgh?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is wrong. Conflict will arise on this matter. The Scottish Office officials who must deal with the allocation of costs within the Strathclyde passenger transport authority may be quite busy in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to take up too much of the Committee's time, but I too welcome what the Minister has said. It is clear that the amendments and the new clause recognise a clear deficiency in the Bill. Even before the new authorities are set up, the Bill has created a massive and immediate problem. It highlights the ill-considered nature of the Bill that an organisation as vital to the west of Scotland as the Strathclyde passenger transport authority should be unable to raise money in the market to pay for the long-term re-equipping of its trains because the Government had not thought through the consequences of their creation of unitary authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that the Government have tackled that problem, but only after a lot of anxiety and confusion had been caused and only as a result of the well known tenacity of Councillor Malcolm Waugh, the chairman of the Strathclyde region highways and transportation committee. Councillor Waugh is one of my local regional councillors. He is without doubt the longest-serving committee chairman in the history of Strathclyde region. His prowess, ability, talent and intelligence are well known, and I am glad that the Minister paid proper tribute to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without Councillor Waugh's tenacity, it is possible that this valuable project, which is crucial to the future of the west of Scotland, would have collapsed. The constituency of the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Eastwood, and the few other Tory enclaves in the area, would have suffered as much as any other area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister read out a brief and told the Committee that a problem had been rectified. That was a confession of failure, and an admission that the Government had not realised the Bill's impact on a very valuable service. The Committee should be grateful to Strathclyde regional council and to Councillor Malcolm Waugh for bringing the Government up short and for ensuring that the new clause was tabled, thus saving everyone from the problems that would have resulted otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to second the vote of thanks to Councillor Malcolm Waugh, whom I have known for 20 years. Negotiating with him is a little like playing poker.

It was a genuine problem. The expert advice that I received was that the terms of the Bill were in order and covered that situation. Senior counsel had given Lombards legal advice of a different nature. As soon as I knew that, the other Minister and I withdrew to consider the terms of an amendment. The problem has been resolved and I believe that Councillor Malcolm Waugh is happy with the outcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 42 gives the power to secure the management of traffic control systems. Local regional councils in Scotland have plenty of experience of managing traffic control systems, the best known of which—the CITRAC system—covers traffic in Glasgow and from Hamilton to Dumbarton. There are equivalent systems around Edinburgh and the other conurbations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1290</span>
There is a wealth of experience in regional highways authorities of operating those traffic control systems. Those of us who have witnessed the spectacular improvements in the flow of traffic at the Gogar roundabout in Edinburgh and in other parts of Scotland will know what has been achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State is taking powers to take over or to establish such systems in the future. I am worried about the difficulties that could arise if the Secretary of State took upon himself powers to run traffic control systems on roads which, in many cases, will still be the responsibility of the local authorities. The amendment is designed to ensure that there is proper consultation and co-operation between the Secretary of State, who has the function of imposing traffic control systems and the local authorities whose responsibility is to plan, maintain and run the roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will no doubt say, as usual, that it will be all right on the night, but we do not have confidence in that statement and it is important that there should be safeguards. There could be circumstances in which the Government are running a traffic control system that directs increased flows of traffic on to roads that are the responsibility of local authorities and which cannot cope with the additional flow of traffic. Yet again, the Government are exercising power without responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must be consultation, co-ordination and a proper understanding between the Scottish Office and local highways authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Problems of co-ordination are likely when the system gets underway. It is another example of a two-tier system where roads are shuffled between local authorities and the Scottish Office. To be effective, network management must involve all roads in a given area and must provide for proper co-ordination across local authority boundaries. The subject is no less important within each area of one of the new councils where there are two roads authorities—the council and the Secretary of State. The code of practice for the reduction of traffic delays at roadworks, sponsored by the Scottish Office and the County Surveyors' Society highlights the need for effective liaison when crossing national, regional and divisional boundaries. It also states that account should be taken of the total programme of projects that will affect the network, including all road improvements and maintenance and, more importantly, the works of statutory undertakers and the effect of adjacent developments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How many roads does the Secretary of State intend to control directly as trunk roads? How many roads will be taken over by Central Government rather than by the new authorities? What sort of traffic control functions should be transferred to the Secretary of State by the Bill? Why does the Secretary of State need such a transfer of function? Answers to those questions would clarify the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will the Government ensure, for example, the co-ordination of sporting and other entertainment events? Those events will affect not only the local authority in whose area the venue happens to be, but the other authorities en route to such sporting or other major events. The Roads and Street Works Act 1991 places responsibility on roads authorities to co-ordinate all
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0715">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1291</span>
activities both with adjoining authorities on strategic roads and on a local basis concerning roads within a given authority's area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The activities to be co-ordinated encompass the execution of works of all kinds, including works for utilities. Such co-ordination can be best achieved by the local authority acting as agent for the Secretary of State, using a register or database for both local roads and trunk roads to record work now carried out locally over areas that correspond to those of the new councils. Has the Minister any idea of how current, unified databases can be dispersed and at what cost, because they are important in ensuring that the road networks operate efficiently?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole thrust of the Bill is to obtain better co-ordination of all works within the road network to reduce abortive work and consequent delay to road users. Trunk roads cannot be viewed in isolation due to the inevitable diversions onto the local road network at times of lane or carriageway closure for any works. That spillover from the trunk system to the local road system is crucial to the code of practice "Safety at Street Works and Road Works" and chapter 8 of "Traffic Signs Manual", which introduced new stringent safety requirements. They will inevitably mean that, in future, road closure and the problems arising from diverted traffic will be more frequent. The Minister will not be thanked if road closures and diverted traffic between an unco-ordinated trunk road and local road systems are the end product.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen to specialist regional road safety teams? Does the Minister know how many road safety teams exist in Scotland? What does he expect will happen to them after the new, smaller road authorities are formed? For example, in Tayside, there is an accident, investigation and prevention team made up of four specially trained people. How will they fare under the Minister's new system? Will joint working relationships cater for such specialist activities? Have discussions taken place on that matter or is it being left to fate and to the new councils?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to road safety and traffic management, what plans does the Minister have for the A92 Dundee to Arbroath road or the A930 Monifieth to Dundee road? A major mistake was made when the road was detrunked in the 1970s. The traffic volume was heavy then, but now it is rediculous. The A92 in particular simply cannot cope with present traffic flows. Does the Minister intend that either the A92 or the A930 should be retrunked? Is he aware of the considerable investment that will have to be made in those roads? The A92, which I use regularly, has for decades been inadequate for the the vast volume of traffic that uses it. Will the Minister specifically state whether he intends to trunk the A92?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, the hon. Gentleman asked how much of Scotland is likely to be trunked. There are some 30,000 miles of local roads for which local authorities are responsible. We are considering up to 750 miles,—it will probably be less than that. The actual amount is relatively small in the overall picture. Of course, I accept that it could be significant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1292</span>
The hon. Gentleman wants an answer about specific roads. I am not in a position to give him an answer yet, as I shall explain. Our consultation document on local government reform described the various categories of roads and the different responsibilities which fall upon local and central Government. While central Government retain responsibility for the national system of routes for through traffic in Scotland—the trunk road system—the councils will keep their responsibility for the local roads. The judgment on which roads are mainly local in character will be taken having regard to the geographical areas of responsibility of the new councils. In addition to the roads that will be trunked, certain roads may be detrunked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The changes that may take place will be intended to ensure that the boundary between national and local networks is appropriately drawn. The function and importance of certain of the present local roads suggest that they might more appropriately figure in the trunk road network and, as I have just said, some others may be detrunked. We have made substantial progress in identifying the likely changes and I intend that these will be made public and be the subject of consultation within the next six months. It is intended that this consultation will be with all interested organisations, including the regional councils, the emergency services and the organisations representing road users. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's specific questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened carefully to the arguments of the hon. Member for East Lothian regarding the amendments. Where two or more traffic authorities fail to make satisfactory joint arrangements for the provision of a traffic control system across their boundaries, the amendments would require the Secretary of State to obtain their agreement before using his powers under the clause. I believe that it would be a mistake to amend the clause in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would also delete the provisions in subsection (2), which permit the Secretary of State to transfer the functions of the authorities concerned that he considered necessary to allow him to secure the provision and management of a joint traffic control system. The amendments would also prevent him from using a local traffic authority as his agent to run a joint system of traffic control. It would be a mistake to amend the clause in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is already a statutory duty of local traffic authorities under section 122 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 to exercise their traffic functions to secure the expeditious, convenient and safe movement of vehicles and pedestrians. This duty is already considered to be sufficiently important that reserve powers of the Secretary of State are provided under the 1984 Act. Those reserve powers permit the Secretary of State to intervene when he considers a local traffic authority is failing in its duties under section 122.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The powers that are proposed in clause 42 are analogous to the reserve powers in the 1984 Act. This clause again states that the duty to secure expeditious, convenient and safe movement of vehicles and pedestrians is sufficiently important to warrant the Secretary of State being given reserve powers to ensure satisfactory performance of that duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 464 would severely constrain the Secretary of State's ability to use the powers to ensure the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0716">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1293</span>
expeditious, convenient and safe movement of vehicles and pedestrians. The main requirements of a system of traffic control include the erection and maintenance of traffic signals, matrix gantry signals, and a system of control of such signals. Some orders may also be necessary under the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 465 would remove the powers that permit the Secretary of State to operate a system of joint traffic control and instead provide him with powers to require an order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 466 would preclude the Secretary of State from using an authority as his agent to run a joint system of traffic control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The three amendments would nullify the effectiveness of the clause and make it unworkable. I emphasise that the reserve powers that the Secretary of State seeks with regard to traffic control systems are the same as the reserve powers already provided for other traffic functions by schedule 9 to the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984. It is in the interests of the safety of pedestrians and those who travel by road that the Secretary of State's reserve powers should continue to exist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the amendment would render the clause unworkable.

	<br><blockquote><p>"(4) Any expenses reasonably incurred by an authority in carrying out work under subsection (3) above may be recovered by that authority from the Secretary of State.".</p></blockquote>
Clause 42 is driven by a Scottish Office desire for a unified, centralised and privatised traffic control system for Scotland. The clause grants the Secretary of State powers to remove traffic control on the local network from the local traffic authority and impose his traffic control policies against the wishes of local authorities. Those powers are sought uniquely in Scotland. To add insult to injury, the clause allows the Secretary of State to recover the costs of his imposition from the local authorities. That adds further to the costs of local government reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The removal of local control should be considered against recent pronouncements by the Secretary of State for Scotland about traffic control and executive responsibilities for his roads powers. The Secretary of State has recently begun discussions with the relevant bodies about establishing an executive agency for roads in Scotland. As with the Property Services Agency, the Secretary of State intends to move a large part of Government activity into the private sector. That move is likely to be accelerated by the current speculation about moves towards privatisation of the country's main roads network.

I served—heaven help me—on the Committee that discussed the Property Services Agency and Crown Suppliers Bill so I know what I am talking about In February 1993, the Secretary of State issued a consultation document, entitled, "Where Now?", which dealt with a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1294</span>
national driver information and control strategy for Scotland. Paragraph 8.3 of the document clearly states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is likely that there is a role for a co-ordinating body to execute the interests of the traffic authorities, police, broadcasters, road user organisations and other commercially interested parties in a joint venture".</p></blockquote>
That suggests the concept of a "traffic controller Scotland". The Scottish Office as the national traffic authority might appoint the controller as agent for certain of its responsibilities for network management. The Scottish Office has now confirmed in letters to regional councils that that course of action is preferred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole thrust of those actions is the setting up of a remote and possibly privatised body for management of the road network and traffic control systems. It is remote from any form of accountability to local councils and remote from accountability to those individuals unfortunate enough to reside alongside the major road network or, more importantly, on the local roads and streets feeding traffic into that road network. Under clause 42, those individuals will have no democratic redress should the traffic controller impose on them his own priorities and systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
As an example of the kind of situation which may arise, we should consider the City of Glasgow and its environs. CITRAC—the centrally integrated traffic control system operated by Strathclyde regional council—controls traffic not just on the local motorway system, for which Strathclyde currently has responsibility, but on the whole wide network of surrounding streets in Glasgow and neighbouring towns. Under the Bill that system will cover seven local authority areas. Clause 42 will require those seven authorities not just to agree among themselves on a common traffic control policy, but also to agree with the Secretary of State through his so-called traffic controller.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 42(1)(b), the Secretary of State simply has to decide, without any clear criteria, that the authorities
	<br><blockquote><p>"have not made satisfactory joint arrangements"</p></blockquote>
for him to intervene and impose his policies. There is no definition of "satisfactory". Given the views of the relevant authorities, the citizens of Glasgow may not necessarily agree with the Secretary of State about what traffic control policies are "satisfactory". That imposition of central control is not readily matched by general powers available to the relevant Secretaries of State in England and Wales. Only in London have such powers been made available. There again there is the model of seeking to establish central control through taking over local authority roads and imposing central policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the clause is not only undemocratic, it is costly. It will require additional staff and further transfer of local authority staff. Despite the Minister's statements on Tuesday, page ix of the explanatory and financial memorandum of the Bill clearly sets out in the effects of the Bill on public service manpower the increase in the numbers employed by the Scottish Office and commensurate reduction in local authority manpower.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The costs are clearly set out in table 3.3 on page 9 of the Touche Ross report. From that it is clear that for a 35-authority structure, the management and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0717">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1295</span>
administration costs for roads and transport rise by £21 million—34 per cent. That is the largest percentage rise of any of the service areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In summary, the clause is clearly counter to the whole theme of local accountability and providing value for money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would ensure that local authorities are given every encouragement to ensure that appropriate traffic control systems are in place and are managed and accountable locally. It would continue the present eminently practical and satisfactory system of local agency agreements. Importantly, they also remove the ability of the Secretary of State to impose costs on local authorities in fulfilment of his own somewhat remote policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ask some questions. The Committee will be relieved to hear that there are are only six, but some of them are rather long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, will the Minister explain what powers equivalent to those proposed to be given to the Secretary of State for Scotland under clause 42 are vested in the appropriate Secretaries of State in England and Wales? Clause 42 effectively gives the Secretary of State for Scotland wide powers relating to traffic control which are not enjoyed by the appropriate Secretaries of State in England and Wales. It is unacceptable that this fundamental change is to be introduced only in Scotland through the process of local government reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The powers become available in Scotland, but not in Swindon, Stroud, or Blackpool—the hon. Member for Blackpool, North (Mr. Elletson) is, I think, a member of the 1922 committee. The powers are not to be available in Leeds, or even in bordering Hexham. That is the first question: why us, and not them?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Government admit in clause 42 that traffic authorities may not always agree over traffic control issues. The Government seek to centralise authority by taking powers to resolve such disagreement. Would not the Minister agree, in the light of his declared wish to maximise local accountability, that a transportation joint board would be a more appropriate body to resolve such conflicts?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
CITRAC plays a vital part in the traffic management of the Clydeside conurbation. It caters for over 600 traffic signal junctions and pelican crossing signals through a central computer. CITRAC was created to answer a need to integrate strategic motorway traffic control with the parallel local road traffic signal network.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Government's proposal, this integrated system will be the responsibility of seven new unitary authorities, each with competing priorities which would become evident in a joint committee. Only a strategic joint board with the ability to act on a strategic traffic management basis will be capable of making the system work effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a joint board is not established then the Bill empowers the Secretary of State to impose his own traffic control policies on local roads. That could involve the Secretary of State imposing his own traffic control policies on the city of Glasgow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At previous sittings, both Ministers have referred to the Wheatley committee report and said that Wheatley
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1296</span>
started off by thinking in terms of unitary authorities. In a sense that is true, but the Wheatley committee was driven inexorably by the logic of the situation, which is that an organisation is needed in the west of Scotland that is rather larger than the seven, separate, atomised authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, will the Minister explain what procedures are to be laid down concerning the rights of appeal by a new authority where—under subsection (2)—the Secretary of State seeks to impose a traffic control system contrary to the wishes of the relevant roads authority and confirm that Schedule 9 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 is not prejudiced?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 42 is framed in such a way that it gives the Secretary of State powers to impose a traffic control system on new authorities where
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State considers that…the authorities for those roads have not made satisfactory joint arrangements.".</p></blockquote>
It may be the case that new authorities with clear justification consider that they have satisfactory arrangements and view the Secretary of State's intervention as unreasonable. It is not unreasonable under such conditions that there should be some appeal procedure. If no appeal procedure is to be written into clause 42, then assurances that the provisions of Schedule 9 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 are not in anyway prejudiced will require to be inserted as appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fourth question is will the Minister explain why he considers that the Secretary of State's powers under schedule 9 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 are insufficient to secure the management of traffic control systems? The Secretary of State already has equivalent reserve powers to make traffic orders under schedule 9 of that Act. Apart from circumventing the requirements of the Act, there appears to be no reason for the inclusion of clause 42 in the Bill other than to facilitate the imposition of central control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Knapman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stroud)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman tell us what schedule 9 of the 1984 Act says?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have it here, but as I am short of time, the hon. Gentleman can look it up for himself. I will be frank. Others and not least myself have worked hard on this brief. We take the issue seriously and I have sought much expert advice, however, I do not want to take too much time on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fifth question is will the Minister explain the justification for considering it necessary for the Secretary of State to have powers to intervene in traffic control when no need is expressed for him to intervene in other vital areas of service provision, such as road safety and public transport co-ordination and promotion? It is accepted that traffic control is an important area of road authorities' responsibilities and that problems will arise in ensuring that consistent and satisfactory standards are maintained across council boundaries. Other issues will be generated as a result of a greater number of smaller authorities. They include road safety and public transport co-ordination and promotion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened carefully to what the Minister said about road safety. I have not the slightest doubt that he is as
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0718">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1297</span>
concerned about it as anyone else in the Room. Most, if not all, road authorities have reacted positively to the Government's road accident casualty reduction target for the year 2000. They have built up considerable expertise in tackling road safety in a highly professional and multidisciplinary manner. Smaller authorities will not generally be able to justify retaining sufficient specialist staff to enable such valuable work to continue. I am greatly worried by the bust-up of specialist staff in Lothian region, whose expertise has brought great benefit to the Minister's constituents and mine. The recent trend in fewer people being killed and injured on our roads could be reversed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Public transport co-ordination and promotion is an important issue. Authorities have built up considerable expertise in ensuring that region-wide public transport information is made readily available to all potential users. Smaller authorities may not be able to justify the costs associated with the provision of region-wide information to the long-term detriment of encouraging greater use of public transport. That issue was not answered by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will be thankful to hear that I have come to my final question. How will the Minister ensure the survival of expert accident investigation and prevention units under the new 30 authority structure? Does the Minister think that the new authorities will have sufficient resources to meet the Government's targets for the reduction in road accidents and casualties by one third by the year 2000. All Scottish road authorities have accepted the Government's targets. To achieve meaningful inroads into the problem, authorities see the need not only to expand the traditional three Es—engineering, enforcement and education on road safety—but to integrate the activities at a professional level while recognising that they are not always mutually exclusive. For example, engineering measures often require a publicity campaign.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of equal importance is the need for good quality accident statistics and the ability to quantify the benefits of remedial or educational campaigns. For example, is value for money obtained? In Strathclyde and in Lothian, road safety planning has been based on a multidisciplinary approach involving engineers, the police, educationists and health board officials, providing a wide-ranging service that targets road accident casualty reduction in an effective manner. I do not want to quarrel, but I doubt whether an authority the size of the proposed new West Lothian could do that. I do not believe that it could give the same effective expertise as we have come to expect from Lothian region.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend think that the three Ayrshire authorities—he spoke on their behalf earlier in the debate—would have the expertise to carry out those functions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what is called a yorker, if cricket is played in Ayrshire—and it is, very effectively. I must say gently to my hon. Friend, having promised that I shall never again step over the Ayrshire border, that there is a serious answer, and he and I are united in this: the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1298</span>
break-up of Strathclyde as such is a crying shame. Let us end on that unison—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The last time that I was in his constituency was at the Tarbolton Burns club.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The target set by the Government for reductions in fatal and serious casualties has now been met. Recent measures which have played their part in bringing about a reduction in the casualty total include: the introduction of traffic calming schemes in residential areas; use of the latest technology available, such as speed and red light violation cameras; publicity campaigns intended to educate the classes of road users targeted—for example, speeding drivers and elderly pedestrians; and, the implementation of schemes designed to improve road layout when there is an identifiable and treatable injury or accident problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I gave an undertaking to my Front Bench colleagues that I would take 20 minutes. I thank the Committee for having listened to those questions. I believe that they are distilled, considered and important. At some stage, they must be properly answered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not proceed with the break up of successful organisations—as I know Lothian has been and I believe Strathclyde to have been. I comment not on Tayside, which has sent a powerful brief which I have read and on which my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East will speak. The Government should think again before they commit the act of breaking up boundaries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to respond to the hon. Member for Linlithgow who raised some important points, especially on road safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may give some background to the subject. In February 1993, the consultation document "Where Now?"—a national driver information and control strategy for Scotland—was issued. In that document, it was proposed that there should be a national centre that would collate and circulate traffic information on the inter-urban network and would interface with local urban traffic control centres. It is further envisaged that a traffic controller of Scotland would be appointed as agent to the Secretary of State to manage the national centre. The traffic controller would operate only the traffic control system of matrix signs on trunk roads; the traffic would not be responsible for the operation of local authority traffic signals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman was concerned that the powers under the clause could lead to privatisation. If I may say so, he misunderstands the clause's intention. The clause would be used only when two traffic authorities had failed satisfactorily to provide the necessary system of joint traffic control. The Secretary of State would then adopt some of the powers of the local traffic authorities involved and use one of those traffic authorities as an agent to provide and manage a suitable system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A similar provision has already been made in England and Wales in schedule 5(10) of the Local Government Act 1985. Those powers applied to Greater London and the metropolitan counties, which was essential following the abolition of the Greater London council. I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman wants Scotland slavishly to follow the provisions for England but in this case it makes good sense to have comparable provisions on national lines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1299</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a question of slavishly following the provisions for England, but of wanting a rational explanation why the centralisation powers should be introduced in Scotland and not in England. If the Minister had said the same thing about the poll tax, with hindsight—and indeed at the time—eyebrows might have been raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I was answering the hon. Gentleman's question, he may have been distracted by a conversation with the Whip. These powers exist in England in schedule 5 to the Local Government Act 1985 and relate to Greater London and the metropolitan counties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Agency status is not the same as privatisation; it is not the same when a local authority is the agent; even were a task to be carried out by a private firm on behalf of the Secretary of State, he would remain responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised the issue of joint boards. It could be suggested that the operation of a joint system of traffic control under clause 42 should be run under the better provision of a joint board. The provision of a joint board would not be suitable under this clause, which would operate only when two or more local authorities had failed to agree to provide a suitable system of joint traffic control. In those circumstances, the arrangement provided in the Bill whereby the Secretary of State utilises one of the authorities to provide and manage a suitable system as his agent is more appropriate than a joint board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is for authorities to decide how best to run systems after reorganisation; joint committees are one option. If they thought it appropriate they could ask the Secretary of State to establish a joint board under clause 20. As in other matters, the difference between what the Government and the hon. Gentleman suggests is that the Government are not in the business of imposing solutions from the centre: local government is best placed to take such decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the Minister accept that if a joint board is not established, the Bill as drafted empowers the Secretary of State to impose his own traffic control policies on local roads? Is not that the case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 42(4)(b) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"where there is no agreement, as may be determined by him."</p></blockquote>
Of course, it is much better if such matters are agreed and followed up at local level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned rights of appeal. If the Secretary of State acted unreasonably, he would be open to judicial review of his actions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course it is better if matters are agreed at local level but there are many circumstances which my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. That is why we put in a reserve power for the Secretary of State. The hon. Gentleman is making my argument for me. The Secretary of State should have a reserve power to intervene when there is no agreement
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1300</span>
and jobs are not being done properly, putting road safety at risk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's reluctant agreement to allow me to intervene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Was not the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow valid? The Committee is down to dicussing the detail of traffic management schemes and the Minister is telling us that, of course, for some small authorities it will not work. We are discussing one authority becoming an agency for others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does not the Minister agree that there will be another power for the Secretary of State? Is not it nonsensical that there will be a two-tier solution to what the Government perceive as a single-tier problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I do not accept that. I am saying that the Secretary of State has a responsibility to the people of Scotland to make certain that it works. Were the Secretary of State to intervene, he could make an order transferring to him whichever traffic functions he considered necessary to a secure and effective system of traffic control. He could then request an adjoining authority to carry out the functions and recover the cost of doing so from the authorities that failed to make satisfactory provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May we clarify this point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. There can be disagreement and in such cases it is necessary in the interests of the safety of those who use the roads and of pedestrians that the Secretary of State should have the reserve power and use it should it be necessary to do so. I would not for a moment assume, however, that authorities will not act responsibly. I believe that they will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is not reasonable, but it is reasonable that authorities that are considered not to be meeting a statutory duty should pay for the joint system, rather than the Secretary of State. The amendment should be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends and I had thought of withdrawing the amendment, but having heard the Minister's answers I am much more reluctant to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If what the Minister said is correct—half the questions have not been answered—why is a power being taken for the Secretary of State if there is no intention to centralise the function? What has happened to local democracy? It has gone out of the proverbial window. Local democracy has been silenced. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> A prolonged yawn has come from the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Minister's answer, I heard nothing about an appeal procedure. If no such procedure is to be included in the clause, assurances that the provisions of schedule 9 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 are not in any way prejudiced and will be required to be inserted as appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should reflect on the appeal procedure. When the Committee reassembles at 9 pm, he may have some good answers. The matter is extremely important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"We recommend that local government should continue to be directly responsible for an appropriate part of the roads system. We believe that this is desirable for the sake of efficiency and local interest, and that it is also required because of trie intimate connection between roads and physical planning, whether on the broader or on the purely local scale."</p></blockquote>
The Government can read the Wheatley committee report, but they should take into account the considered opinion of a consensual, all-party body that took evidence and—bluntly—did a great deal more work than has been done this time around.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with great interest to the hon. Gentleman. He raised an important question about road safety, which I shall answer with particular care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to say that I do have confidence in what can be achieved by the new councils following reorganisation. The Committee will be aware of the great strides that have been made since we set a target for a one third reduction in road casualties by 2000. For the groups of most concern—the fatal and serious injuries—that target has been met with seven years still to run. The number killed
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1302</span>
in road accidents in Scotland fell in 1993 to fewer than 400. That is still far too high, and the full 1993 figures are not yet available, but the statistics show that encouraging progress is being made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful that the Minister has outlined the excellent record of the specialist local authority road safety teams throughout Scotland. How does he hope to sustain that record if he persists in his intention to break up the teams?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman anticipates what I am about to say. There is a considerable amount of expertise on road safety matters within the roads authorities. That expertise has been built up over the years and we must ensure that it continues. That knowledge must be tapped by all those who tackled road safety issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<i>rose—</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me reply to the hon. Gentleman. The size of the councils has meant that they could have in place road safety units large enough to operate in an almost self-contained manner. That can have advantages, but it does not lead to the necessary sharing of ideas, techniques, experience and results that can allow the wider road safety community to learn faster and to proceed more quickly with the changes needed to make our roads safer still.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new councils will undertake a large degree of sharing and co-operation. That will allow them to take forward the successes that have been achieved. The expertise will remain but it will be spread among more councils which must concentrate on maximising the opportunities for working together. There is already good evidence of the willingness of the road safety community to work together. The County Surveyors Society, which I suspect might be following this debate, over the years has shown its interest in this area and has worked hard to introduce changes and improvements. It has co-operated with the Scottish Office in producing codes of practice on road safety subjects, for example on safety at road works. Those links are valuable and will allow further improvements to be achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The County Surveyors Society has also been instrumental in the setting up, by COSLA, of a road safety group. That group's first report should be available soon. It could provide an opportunity, which I welcome, to discuss with COSLA its deliberations and conclusions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thoroughly agree with the Minister and congratulate the road safety teams on their excellent work. Can the Minister clarify what is in his mind? Will specialist teams, such as Strathclyde's road safety unit, be replicated in each local authority or will there be a joint arrangement to cover this function for a group of authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I spelt out clearly that the councils will want a high degree of co-operation and sharing in order to build on the successes that have already been achieved. A number of other organisations, such as the British Institute of Traffic Education Research, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents and the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0721">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1303</span>
Automobile Association, work in this area and contribute to the achievement of accident reduction. Such co-operation is exemplified in the road safety plans that have been introduced by many roads authorities. The plan for Strathclyde was introduced about two years ago. I am glad to inform the hon. Member for Hamilton that his friend, councillor Malcolm Waugh, was kind enough to provide me with a copy when we discussed the M77 Ayr road route. It is a commendable document, as are those from Lothian and Fife. They show that what the hon. Member for Linlithgow referred to as the multi-disciplinary approach has been adopted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish road safety campaign is another prime example of the road safety community working together and in so doing adding to the effectiveness of the individual organisations that contribute. The road safety campaign has been examined and the recommendation is that it should continue with a strengthened role. It will provide a further means of co-ordinating and assisting the work of individual councils on road safety through its efforts on the campaigning front.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mention those developments as they show the many ways in which councils will be able to participate in different aspects of road safety work beyond their own boundaries, so that they can bring back to their areas the lessons and knowledge contributed by others.

I answered the hon. Member for Linlithgow's question about appeals, but at that moment he was distracted. He thought that I had not answered his question so I shall go through it again. The appeal procedures in schedule 9 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 do not apply to this order. We are not, however, depriving people of remedies. The reasonableness of the Secretary of State's action under clause 42 could be challenged in court, for example by judicial review. With that explanation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not push his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That explanation does not satisfy us.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have only two points to make. The first is to expose a contradiction, which I have raised as a point of order. Part V of the Bill's explanatory and financial memorandum on page ix states:
	<br><blockquote><p>	<i>"Clause 38 and Part IV </i>will result in a further small reduction in local authority staffing levels and a commensurate small increase in the numbers employed by The Scottish Office."</p></blockquote>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow pointed out, the Touche Ross report states that a move to 30 authorities will lead to an increase in administrative costs of about one third. However, on Tuesday, the Under-Secretary of State said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I said that there would be no change as far as Scottish Office staff were concerned".—	<i>[Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 15 March 1994; 	<i>c.</i> 1215.]</p></blockquote>
We need an explanation for those major contradictions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point will attract you, Sir James, particularly as it is St. Patrick's day. I consulted my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald), who has second sight. With his help, I have looked ahead to 1996 when the Bill will be in operation. The Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Eastwood will play a part because it is just before the election when the Bill will be repealed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us picture the scene. In the summer of 1996, there is a flash storm. Mr. Brown notices a dangerous situation caused by a blocked gully on the A701 in his home town of Penicuik, which is shortly to be moved into the Borders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Brown remembers the Lothian CLARENCE number. What a good idea, he thinks. He rings the number
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0722">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

and is told that the councils cannot agree on a joint arrangement for funding to enable CLARENCE can continue. The service has been discontinued. He says, "I didn't expect that. This is not what the Under-Secretary of State or the Secretary of State for Scotland promised."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Brown then writes to the roads office, which is in Haddington. He tells it the problem. A week later, he receives a polite reply saying that it is a trunk road and, therefore, the responsibility of the Scottish Office. He phones the Scottish Office and receives the usual polite reply. However, he is told that the road has been handed over to a privatised agent which should be contacted at its Glasgow office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That comes later. Mr. Brown thinks that that is strange. Therefore, he telephones the Glasgow office and is told that co-ordination is now being undertaken for the company by a special unit in Berkshire and that his letter has been sent there for attention and action.

Two days after receiving the final letter and five weeks after his initial complaint, Mr. Brown drives down the A701 into another large puddle, aquaplanes, crashes and is killed. That is the story—a cautionary tale from 1996. It is no joke.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The year 1996 may be an election year. Is the hon. Gentleman trying to describe a scenario from a period of Labour government? If so, it is horrendous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall return to 1994.1 have been trying, by using the cautionary tale that has been helpfully provided for me, to convey a serious message. At the moment responsibility is clear. Local people in Lothian or in Strathclyde know whom to contact about problems with the roads. They know whom they must deal with. The buck is not passed and people know where it stops. Under the new arrangements they will not know whether the Scottish Office or the little councils, East Renfrewshire or East Lothian, should be dealing with it. Perhaps the function would be privatised. I used the example of Berkshire. In the case of Kyle and Carrick, the way things are going, people will have to telephone Madrid to have their problems dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only encouraging fact was mentioned by the hon. Member for Tayside, North. Before too many such stupidities are committed and too many such dangers are established, an election will take place and there will be a Labour Government. Changes will be made and we shall return to a sensible system that takes care of the interests of the people—not the contractors, privatised companies or bureaucrats, but the people whom we represent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1306</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall explain more fully the transfer of staff on the trunking of roads. To give the Committee a picture of what is involved, I should mention that the trunk road network consists of about 2,000 miles of routes of national importance, including motorways. The primary route network contains a further 750 miles of roads under local control. Additions to the trunk road network as a result of reorganisation will almost certainly be in that category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will appreciate that staffing is a complex aspect of the matter. The normal provisions of the Bill will apply to many staff who work in local authority roads departments. They will transfer to the new authorities. In some cases, particular staff—for example, a design team—may be dedicated to a particular road. If such a road were trunked, the staff whose jobs were connected to it could transfer to the new authorities, or to the employment of the Secretary of State. That might happen if the TUPE regulations applied. There is no hard and fast rule, nor would it be appropriate to make one at this stage. Arrangements must be sorted out case by case by authorities, which will have their own staffing requirements to consider, and by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give hon. Members my complete assurance that in every case the interests of individual staff members would be paramount. It may be helpful to give an example of the circumstances in which a transfer to the Scottish Office might arise. If a design team was working on a certain road improvement scheme in a council area, and if the Secretary of State were to trunk the road under the provisions of the Bill, a question would arise as to whether the team should transfer to become the responsibility of the Scottish Office. The council might not wish to lose all the expertise assembled in the team. It would not, therefore, be an open and shut case. The opportunity for transfer will exist. We shall have to examine individual cases in the light of the proposals on trunking and in discussion with councils, which will have views on the appropriate disposition of their staff.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What happens when a group of staff who work on a specific road, which is trunked, transfer to the Scottish Office? What happens when the road project is complete? Are the staff guaranteed continuing employment with the Scottish Office? Will they be dismissed when the trunking project is complete?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that the staff will remain with the Scottish Office. But we want to consult about such matters because their implications for every relevant council must be properly considered. Interests must be weighed carefully. The shape of the map is relevant in determining the outcome of those matters. I hope that I have presented a picture—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We may get a different response from the Minister on this occasion. At this late hour, one victory is probably enough. The Secretary of State is again taking meddling powers. The local government reorganisation is so confused and half-baked that the Secretary of State seems to loom large in every subsection of every clause that we have discussed. I should be grateful for the Minister's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How does the Minister justify the extension of powers to the Secretary of State to issue directions on local roads in relation to traffic powers through the instrument of local government reform? The Secretary of State already has reserve powers under schedule 9 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 to direct local authorities to make orders. That should surely be sufficient. How does the Minister justify the extension of the powers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, the hon. Gentleman is being inconsistent. He believes strongly in road safety and it is a duty of the Scottish Office to give appropriate guidance to authorities on the use of their traffic powers. The clause requires the authorities to have regard to such guidance before using the order-making powers in the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984. The clause simply permits the Secretary of State to enforce the advice in the guidance. That is a sensible procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Committee accepts the sense of having provision in the Bill that will allow the Secretary of State to issue guidance. It is intended to help the councils. The amendment does not interfere with that power, but it would remove subsections (7) and (8) and thus the scope for ensuring that the rest of the clause could operate. The subsections provide the Secretary of State with the power to direct a council on the action that it must take if it does not comply with the guidance. If it fails to act on the direction, they allow the Secretary of State to take the necessary action himself and recover the cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not expect the powers to be used. They are included to ensure that the rest of the clause is acted upon by the councils. It may be suggested that they are unnecessary, that councils will always act reasonably and responsibly and that there will be no need for the Secretary of State to intervene. I hope that that will be the case. In an ideal world, there would be no need to write sanctions into legislation if everybody acted reasonably and responsibly. Unfortuantely, it may be otherwise and we regard the powers as no more than a wise precaution to support the operation of the provisions and to secure reasonable co-operation between councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State will act on the provisions only when it has become clear that the actions or failures of an authority are likely to upset the arrangements of another authority. Long before that stage is reached, it will be evident to an authority that such a conflict arises. Before the Secretary of State issues a direction he must consult the authority. That provides a further opportunity to sort things out. Only then, if the authority continues to act in a manner that conflicts with the guidance, would he issue a direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions represent a reasonable set of reserve powers and their presence will provide an incentive to

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1310</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain why the Bill seeks to impose more red tape on successor authorities and the Secretary of State by making it mandatory for existing authorities to seek consent from successor authorities to make traffic orders and, if such consent is refused, to seek the consent of the Secretary of State? The need for existing councils to consult with successor authorities is pure bureaucratic red tape. Traffic orders are made only after following proper and often extensive consultation and the need to defer to successor authorities will hold up implementation, which may have an adverse effect on safety if there is a delay in allowing programmed engineering works to be carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Successor authorities can, it seems, fail to give consent by not responding to a request for consent. That is management by default and it is not acceptable. Where consent is not given by the successor authority, the Secretary of State must give his consent. That can only add to the work of the Scottish Office at a time when staff there will be under pressure occasioned by local government reform. It is unacceptable that undue delay be placed in the way of orders that will promote safety or allow engineering works to proceed. Will the Minister comment on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman gives me the opportunity to respond in more detail. Obviously, it is desirable that there should be maximum continuity. The intention of the clause is that new authorities, on succession, should not be unreasonably hindered by a system of traffic restrictions incompatible with their policies. The amendment will ensure that existing authorities can continue to carry out their traffic functions without being unreasonably delayed by a successor authority's inactivity for whatever reason.

After a date yet to be announced, the regional council must seek the consent of successor authorities before making any order which extends beyond 1 April 1996, including temporary traffic orders. The requirements of the health and safety legislation and chapter 8 of the "Traffic Signs" manual state that temporary traffic orders must relate to certain types of maintenance works on many roads. Those powers have been delegated to the director of roads and transport to expedite works. Certain works may be delayed by this procedure in the period immediately prior to 1 April 1996, unless the new councils are geared up to deal with them. That is an important point about Tayside and I wonder whether the Minister has any comments to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The point made by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) is well taken and, in the circumstances, I invite him to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that firm assurance from the Minister, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>AMENDMENT OF DISTRICT COURTS (SCOTLAND) ACT 1975</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 338, in page 42, line 46, after "parties", inset "solicitors,". I am sure that the Minister would accept that it is of the utmost importance that local authorities take into account the views of the principal users of the district courts when
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1312</span>
determining the location and timing of court sittings. Accordingly, this amendment is also necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 47 rightly amends section 2 of the District Courts (Scotland) Act 1975 to require a new local authority, when determining where and when a district court should sit, to take into consideration the desirability of minimising the expense and inconvenience to those directly involved in the proceedings before the court. That should ensure that their concerns are at least put before the local authority. It is for the authority to decide what is appropriate, including the interests of other groups, such as the public at large and solicitors. Parties and witnesses are those who are directly involved in court proceedings. They are required by the court to attend for a particular case. Solicitors have an important role in supporting and advising their clients but they do not have such a direct interest. Their involvement is more indirect in that they are representing their client. It is the accused who is the party and it is for the accused to decide how and by whom he should be represented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Member will accordingly agree that his amendment is inappropriate and that he will withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I never move inappropriate amendments, Sir James. There is an important point here, which the Minister may have inadvertently skated over. When the location of courts is being determined, there must be consultation with appropriate interested parties. Solicitors, as the principal court users, should be consulted. They are professional people who are used to working in the courts—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Declare your interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish that I had an interest to declare. I gave up my interest in my local provincial solicitors' practice some time ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister knows Berwickshire quite well, he may know that there have been rumours—I hope that they are only rumours—that the district court at Duns is under threat. Can the Minister assure me that when courts such as Duns are being considered for potential closure, there will be full consultation, and that he has no immediate plans to do anything as rash as closing an important and busy court like Duns? If he can give me that assurance, I might consider withdrawing the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The closure of any district court would be for the new authority to decide. Obviously, the closure of courts is a controverial matter. At present, responsibility for district courts and their sites lies with the local authorities, which have the discretion to determine the location of the court. Some, including Banff and Buchan and Ross and Cromarty, have taken up that discretion. Others have considered a single location within the current district and islands area to be sufficient for local circumstances. The decision is for the local authorities to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am less than satisfied with the Minister's response, but in order to make progress, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>JUSTICES OF THE PEACE</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed:</i> No. 447, in page 43, line 16, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(4) All justices of the peace appointed on or after 1st April 1996 shall be appointed for a period of five years, and on expiry of that period shall be eligible for reappointment, subject to a maximum period of service of fifteen years.".—	<i>[Mr. McLeish.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's concern about the efficiency of lay justice, which has prompted him to table the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that what it is?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of clause 48 is to provide for transitional arrangements for serving justices of the peace to continue to serve in the new commission areas created by the Bill. Any change in the arrangements for the appointment of justices should, in the view of the Scottish Office, be considered carefully, with due consultation, in the context of an overall review. The proposals in the amendment should be scrutinised in that context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Meanwhile, the Government have proposed that the district court system should continue with the minimum essential changes arising from the Bill's general provisions. On that basis, I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am being tempted to withdraw early, Sir James. I am not sure if the Minister has given us a reassurance or an explanation, but in view of his obvious concern, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1314</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire has already referred to the Duns district court I hope that he will not mind me speaking on behalf of one of his constituents, whom I know very well, who is a justice at that court. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The clause refers to a person holding office as justice of the peace for the commission area
	<br><blockquote><p>"in which he resides on that date."</p></blockquote>
