<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>Local Government etc. (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is an extended list of amendments on the Table. There is also some literature that was addressed to the Clerk, but it is intended for hon. Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. On the provisional selection of amendments, it would be helpful if amendments Nos. 90 and 91 on clause 8 were separated so that we could debate them separately. They involve different issues about the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall return to that point later.</span></p>

<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
ELECTIONS AND TERM OF OFFICE OF COUNCILLORS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment proposed [this day]:</i> No. 132, in page 3, line 41, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>"(7) Subject to the provisions of sections 1 to 3 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989, a person shall not be disqualified from being nominated as a candidate for election as, or from being elected or from being a member of local authority by virtue of his holding a paid office or employment in the gift and disposal of the authority or of any joint committee or joint board.".—<i>[Mr. McLeish.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendment: No. 133, in page 3, line 41, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>"(7) A person shall not be disqualified from nomination as a candidate for election as, or for being elected, or for being a member of a local authority by reason of the provisions of section 3 1(1)(a) of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 unless he holds such paid office or employment or other place of profit as the Secretary of State may specify by order.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(8) An order under this section shall be made by statutory instrument subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary-Under Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When we adjourned for lunch, I was about to give the Committee information about the responses to the consultation process on the eligibility of employees to stand for election to the new authorities.<br><br>
Highland regional council commented:
<br><blockquote><p>"In terms of eligibility of employees to stand for election the Council, while regretting that the end of the two-tier system will
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 430</span>
mean that Council employees will now have greater difficulty in seeking election to local authorities (it will be particularly so in the Highland area)"—</p></blockquote>
clearly, it is easier in the central belt—
<br><blockquote><p>"feel that the principle of an official not being able to serve on his employing authority must be adhered to. There does not appear to be scope for workable exceptions to this rule."</p></blockquote>
Those views are shared by many local authorities from different parts of the country.<br><br>
It is worth focusing on the views of councils that are already unitary authorities. Shetland islands council came out with a clear and unequivocal statement. It said:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is the view of the Council that the present arrangements in relation to the eligibility of council employees to stand for election should remain."</p></blockquote>
In the relevant section of their consultation response, Orkney Islands Council concluded that:
<br><blockquote><p>"The basic conflict of interest and possible public perception of that conflict of interst are such that the rights of individual members of staff to stand as elected members cannot be justified against the reputation of local government as a whole and that therefore all members of staff should be prohibited from standing for election to the authority which employs them."</p></blockquote>
Those views are particularly significant because they were offered in the light of practical working experience of the existing rules in unitary authorities.<br><br>
I acknowledge that the other side of the argument was also presented to us by some councils, most of whom argued for a change in the existing rules. They did not argue for the proposals in the amendment, but for a change in the existing rules through some form of restrictions. There was, however, no consensus over what the extent or nature of any such restrictions should be. Some councils argued for "guidelines" being established to prevent a conflict of interest. Others suggested identifying a range of "restricted" posts or "politically sensitive" posts.<br><br>
On the eligibility issue, Strathclyde regional council suggested that in a single-tier structure—I hasten to add that Strathclyde is not in favour of such a structure—appropriate steps should be taken to void such a large number of people being deprived of the possibility of serving their communities as councillors. It took the position suggested by the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish).<br><br>
On the matter of numbers, the hon. Gentleman referred to a figure of up to 300,000. That is an estimate of the number of employees of local authorities in Scotland. The number of people who would be affected by the eligibility rules is only a tiny proportion of that figure. No one suggests that all 300,000 would wish to stand as elected members of the authorities. The numbers of those affected would be a tiny proportion of that figure, given that people, especially in the central belt, could work for one authority but live in another.<br><br>
When considering the specific matter of how arrangements would be made, Strathclyde suggested that provision should be made in respect of employees up to a certain management level which would enable them to stand for election
<br><blockquote><p>"provided they were prepared to take unpaid leave of absence during the period when they became councillors".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Fife, Central said that the Government seemed to be taking an absolute position on the matter and asked whether there was a possibility of amending it. The absolute position is far and away the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0245">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 431</span>
easiest to maintain. I accept that there is an argument for unpaid leave of absence but it is not without difficulty in respect of pension rights and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am listening carefully to the Minister. The majority of Committee members were probably councillors before they were elected to Parliament. We are now Members of Parliament and as such we decide the law of the land, our salaries, our conditions of service and everything that relates to the Palace of Westminster which affects our lives. Why can we do that, and no one question it or thinks that that poses any conflict of interest? When we were councillors, however we were unable to make such judgments if we worked for a unitary authority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The analogy with Members of Parliament is wholly in line with my argument, not the reverse.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will wait a moment. The easiest and by far the most apt parallel with the position of local authority employees who want to be councillors is the position of civil servants who want to be Members of this House. It is clear that civil servants cannot stand for Parliament, whether or not they accept payment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is because we do a full-time job. I was talking about a conflict of interest. We decide our operational arrangements, from the place where we live to the laws to which we are subject. We are able to make such judgments. Surely, the same would apply to elected councillors. The hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) declared his interest as a paid consultant of Scottish Power and we take account of that when we discuss these issues. Could not there be a declaration of interest or, as the Minister suggested earlier, a guideline relating to employees who are elected? A blanket ban is not needed because there are parallels between councillors and Members of Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's point that a person cannot be a civil servant and a Member of Parliament because being a Member of Parliament is a full-time job is invalid. That was a rule long before Members of Parliament worked full time. In the 19th century being a Member of Parliament was not usually regarded as being a full-time job. People today can take a different view about the role of a Member of Parliament.<br><br>
The key point is that civil servants, because of a potential conflict of interest, cannot remain civil servants if they are elected Members of Parliament. That is the parallel, and it is exact. There is a potential conflict of interest, but that is not a criticism of civil servants who, in general, are the most admirable body of people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh <span class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not the analogy with the civil service appropriate to the restricted posts in local government? If I am correct, the term "civil servant" can also apply to a worker in Rosyth and covers a range of trades and businesses, not just civil servants such as those in the Committee Room. Is not the parallel
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 432</span>
with the restricted posts in local government? Would the Minister's ban therefore apply to council cleaning ladies and road workers? If so, the ban is ludicrous.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman implies that somehow the Government are introducing a new ban. We do not propose to introduce a new ban of any sort. There has never been a situation in Scottish local government or in local government in any other part of the United Kingdom in which council employees can be elected members of that council. There is nothing new in the proposal before the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McAllion <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not the Minister being slightly disingenuous? There is something new because we are going back to single-tier local government. In the past, people who worked for a regional council could stand for a district council. People who worked for a district council could stand for a regional council. That is now denied to people. Hundreds of thousands of people are being locked out from the opportunity of taking a part in their local councils.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The principle is clear and consistent. A council employee cannot be a councillor for the authority that employs him or her. He or she can, at present, stand for election and serve on a council other than the one that employs him or her. That will continue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In any other council area?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. That happens at present. There are councillors in Scotland who serve as employees of local authorities. They are able to do that because they live in a council area different from that of the council that employs them. That will continue to be the case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point about a local council is that it is local. People want to serve in their area and in their community. With the larger units and, as the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) said, a new situation, they would have to travel a considerable distance. Their service would not be as local as it would be if they served on their local council. The ban is being applied to a new situation created by the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The geographic situation is different, but the principle remains the same.<br><br>
I shall use an example from the constituency of the hon. Member for Dundee, East. If a person living in Monifieth is employed by Dundee council, which is not unlikely, that person will be able to stand for election to the new Angus authority, as at present. There is nothing new about that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister knows, Broughty Ferry is immediately adjacent to Monifieth. If somebody lives in Broughty Ferry and works for Dundee district council, he cannot stand for election to a local council. Why is the Minister discriminating against residents of Broughty Ferry, but not against residents of Monifieth?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is renowned for his sophistry in some of these matters. He knows perfectly well that, at the moment, somebody living in Broughty
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0246">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 433</span>
Ferry and working for Dundee district council cannot stand for election to Dundee district council.</span></p>
<p>4.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely someone living in Broughty Ferry and working for Angus district council can stand as a councillor in Dundee, as long as he is working in Angus? That is a natural link and the very point that the Minister is making.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Opposition Members are discussing not the amendment but the possibility of any sort of compromise. Is there a reasonable way out, as some authorities have suggested? No consensus on a way out is emerging. There is a conceivable route, through leave of absence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that there is a compromise, and I wonder why the Minister has not come to it. May I ask him a question which might help? If schools opt out, the staff of those schools can, presumably, stand for the local authority. If services are flogged off to, for example, a Spanish company such as FOCSA, presumably the employees working for that company carrying out the contracted-out service can stand for the council.<br><br>
The Minister is making the case that it is more likely for opting out and flogging off to occur, so that people would then be eligible to stand for the council. That seems to be the motivation behind what he is up to.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have heard some conspiracy theories in my time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is worth exploring. Let us take an example. Let us suppose that the new South Ayrshire authority—God forbid it should go ahead—is Tory-controlled, although I hope the electorate would not allow that. That council then contracts out its cleaning services. Why does the scaflie working for the Spanish company have any different sort of interest than he did the week before when he worked for the local authority? What has changed from one week to the next?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly the present position. The logic of the hon. Gentleman's argument is interesting: any private sector company that supplies services to a council—it may derive 5 per cent. of its output from supplying that council—should have all its employees banned from standing for the council. The logic of his argument is wholly absurd.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon McMaster <span class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: By extending that logic a little further, will the Minister explain why somebody who works for a direct labour organisation in a local authority, which is at arm's length and working as a contractor for the council, should be excluded?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because he is ultimately an employee of the council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the Opposition fail to appreciate that if the DLO gives contracts on a competitive basis, the employees, including the director, are still employed by the council?<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 434</span>
It would be a problem if the DLO director was accountable to one of his employees.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. That problem has been identified by several councils to which I have referred. The Opposition believe that that view is solely held by the Government, but that is not the case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The matter is more complex than the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) pretends. A director or manager in a local authority is unlikely to be accountable to one councillor. Any councillor in a position of authority is backed by a committee and is therefore not a free agent. He or she is not in a position to direct the line manager to undertake activities that would benefit an individual.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No one denies that the issue is potentially complex. However, a DLO employee could be chairman of that committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree that the position is more complex than it seems. If four or five DLO employees decide to stand as councillors and are elected, they could form a majority on a committee. Their boss could thus be accountable to them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is quite correct. My hon. Friend's point highlights the practical difficulties of not accepting the straightforward view of many councils in Scotland. Those councils are made up of practical men with no political axe to grind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will have an opportunity to make a contribution to the debate. I wish to conclude, so that other hon. Members may speak, but I shall give way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I take the Minister back to his mythical councillor in Monifieth who works for Dundee district council? If Dundee council and Angus and Mearns council formed joint boards—as they will have to do under the Bill—would the Monifieth councillor be barred from participation in joint boards or committees, or from voting on any joint agreements?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If it is a voluntary arrangement, the councils must decide. That is clear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I have given way three times. Hon. Members can make their contributions later.<br><br>
I shall quote the words of the Montgomery committee on the point that we are discussing. That committee examined the issue in the context of islands councils. Opposition Members have identified a problem, which is likely to be worse in the islands. The chances of an islands council employee living anywhere apart from the islands are extremely limited. It would not be a Dundee-Monifieth predicament. The Montgomery committee concluded:
<br><blockquote><p>"We recognise that this disqualification is a cause of real disappointment to many council employees in these single tier
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0247">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 435</span>
authorities. We have given serious consideration to how this might be overcome, if not for all employees, then at least for certain designated groups. However, we find it impossible to draw any satisfactory distinction between those who should remain disqualified and those who should not."</p></blockquote>
The committee makes the point referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North, that
<br><blockquote><p>"the council could easily contain a majority of council employees (or even a majority of a single category of employee). We think that such a situation is totally undesirable, and we see no way to overcome that problem."</p></blockquote>
On the general point of political activity, the committee concluded:
<br><blockquote><p>"the present restriction on council employees is not that they should avoid all political activity: there is considerable scope for political activity short of standing for election."</p></blockquote>
That point remains.<br><br>
I do not dispute that it is possible to take a different view on this problem and genuinely to seek a way through it. But the hard fact is that the parallel is with the position of civil servants standing for Parliament. The principle is unchanged and has been clear down the ages in local government. Endless efforts to find a reasonable alternative that would be satisfactory have failed—the hon. Member for Fife, Central is tempting me: he says that he has faith in me and I am not sure whether I take that comment seriously—but I do not rule that out entirely, because that would not be sensible.<br><br>
After a great deal of consultation and thought, we have come to the conclusion that the potential conflict of interest problem is very real and the present rules should continue to apply in Scottish local government as they have done in the past and as they do to civil servants.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson <span class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister has acknowledged that there is a problem and I hope that he will be prepared to apply his mind to this serious situation. We are dealing with a matter that could, potentially, strike at the heart of the principle of Scottish local democracy by denying a significant group of people, who, by definition, have expertise in the services provided by local authorities, the right to stand for those local authorities.<br><br>
As ever, I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) for bringing us back to basics on two specific and important points. One is the comparison between the way in which we conduct our affairs in this House and the standards that we seek to impose on another group of equally accountable elected people in Scotland. We are covered by the most woolly network of declarations of interest: hon. Members are supposed to be above that sort of thing, and no doubt they are. If that framework is good enough in the sovereign Parliament, which is supreme over all the affairs of the state, why on earth can we not give equal credit to people who are legitimately elected by the people of Scotland at local level?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I was in full-time service in the Royal Air Force I knew that there was no way I could be a candidate for this Parliament. That was quite clear and everyone knew that. That is exactly the situation in which council employees will find themselves. They will not be available to stand. I had an ambition and a desire to be a Member of Parliament but there was no way I could do that while I was still taking the Queen's shilling.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not broaden the debate to deal with the military and the police who are clearly in a different category. For goodness sake, let us consider in a little more detail the categories of people that we are talking about. The Minister is seeking to defend the proposition that every scaffie, every bin man in Scotland, will be debarred from standing for election to his or her local authority.<br><br>
5 pm<br><br>
On the one hand, the Minister is debarring the bin men from standing for elected authorities, and on the other, as my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley has helpfully explained, directors of companies who tender for lucrative contracts for those local authorities, are eligible to stand for them. I do not object to that. I am prepared to rely on the people. The ballot box is the appropriate sanction. By all means let the directors of companies that are tendering for local authority services stand for election to the same authorities. Why not have things both ways? Why not allow people who are employed by local authorities to stand?<br><br>
We are considering an important matter—the disqualification of about 300,000 people from standing for election to Scotland's local authorities. That is 7 per cent. of the population, equivalent to six parliamentary constituencies. A population of 300,000 would amount to one of the biggest of the new local authorities, or half the population of Glasgow.<br><br>
The problem has been pretty effectively concealed on mainland Scotland since the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, because regional employees have been able to stand for election to district councils and district employees have been able to stand for regional councils. I can think of many such people who have given extremely valuable service to their communities in recent years. I am genuinely worried by the fact that some serving councillors will be prevented, by the abolition of two-tier local authorities in favour of single-tier authorities on mainland Scotland, from continuing to serve their communities. That will be Scotland's loss.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Kynoch <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman accept that the crux of the problem is accountability and that councils exist to set policy, monitor performance and check accountability? How can employees of a council be asked to check their own accountability? The council exists to function on behalf of the taxpayer. The hon. Gentleman referred to the civil service and also, I think, to scaffies. Does not he accept that even in the civil service there are people who brew tea, and yet who are not allowed to stand for Parliament?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am prepared to accept that point. I consider it absurd that certain grades of civil servant are not allowed to stand for Parliament. The hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside mentioned accountability. I repeat that the ultimate accountability lies with the people of the community. People in Scotland are not daft. They will not vote for someone who is evidently involved in graft. Anyone who tries to get away with it will be flung out. Accountability will be there, but unfair discrimination will not arise.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 437</span>
A problem has arisen in the islands. I understand the Minister's point about representations from Shetland islands and Orkney islands councils, but, to judge from my contacts with the Western Isles, it has been identified as a problem that such a high proportion of the population has not been able to stand for the local authority. I suspect that that is one reason that such a high proportion of islands council seats have not been contested in recent years. It would be deplorable to reach that stage on the mainland as well.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For the hon. Gentleman's information, I quoted information from Orkney and Shetland, whose stance is unequivocal. The Western Isles council made no representations either way on the point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the clarification, but I can say from my conversations with elected members and officials of the Western Isles island council that such a problem has been identified.<br><br>
It is undeniable that a high proportion of council seats in the Western Isles and, I think, also in the Orkney and Shetland islands, have not been contested. I recognise and we all recognise that people in certain senior posts should not be directly involved in politics at any level. Many other local authority staff could properly stand for election, however, and bring valuable expertise to those authorities. When appropriate, it is open to elected members who fall into that category of council employees to declare an interest or to be debarred from voting on matters related to staffing, for example. There are ways round the problem, as the Minister acknowledged. Perhaps he could further consider the matter.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central said earlier, there are double standards. There are extremely restrictive provisions that debar teachers, librarians, manual workers and so on who work for a local authority from standing for election to it. Compare that with the position of those working for local enterprise companies and the executive directors of health boards.<br><br>
In response to my question a few weeks ago, the Minister listed 53 paid executive directors of health boards in Scotland, including five executive directors of Lothian health board, two of whom are doctors. They are fine people, there is nothing wrong with their being members of a health board. However, if it is acceptable that paid managers of health boards should be voting members of those boards, why cannot the staff of local authorities stand for election to those authorities? I do not understand why these restrictions are being maintained because they will create a serious problem.<br><br>
I want to take up a point made by the hon. Member for Kincardineshire and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch) about the councillor and the quangocrat, for want of a better word. One is directly accountable to the electorate and the other is accountable only to the Secretary of State, perhaps, and then only if he is discovered doing something wrong. That is an unfair restriction; it is a sledgehammer to crack a nut. It would be perfectly possible to impose requirements on the constitution of local authorities to overcome the problem.<br><br>
It is difficult to get people with commitment and ability to devote the time and energy required to be a local authority councillor. They need very broad shoulders to put up with the treatment and abuse that they receive
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 438</span>
from the Government and from their electorate. We are all aware of that at the moment.<br><br>
Councillors and their families make major sacrifices to make the local democratic system in Scotland function. We shall come to the case for salaries and proper remuneration for councillors later in the Bill. The restrictions, combined with the lack of fair remuneration, could take us back to the bad old days when a high percentage of councillors was returned unopposed and an equally high percentage was made up of retired people and those with what are euphemistically described as independent means.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What exactly is the hon. Gentleman suggesting? Is he suggesting, for example, that a police constable could be elected and become chairman of the police committee? That appears to be his logic. If he is not suggesting that, what is he suggesting? Many people have considered the problem without coming up with a practical answer to it, although they start from a position broadly in sympathy with the sentiments advanced by the hon. Member.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would not be appropriate for a police constable to come through this system and end up as chairman of the police committee. That is an extreme example of a case in which it would be possible to write standing orders—if necessary statutory requirements—to solve the problem. Why is there a blanket ban on every bin man and every council gardener to stop them standing for local authorities? That brings me back to the bad old days to which I referred earlier, when a high proportion of local authority seats were not contested, so there was no accountability in that respect and those who were returned, often unopposed, were, as I said, retired people or people with what are described as independent means.<br><br>
When I was elected to Berwickshire district council in 1974—as an Independent, I admit—I was the one-man opposition on the council. The average age of councillors must have been at least 60 and all, including me, were retired or, as in my case, had independent means, or were self-employed. That is not representative democracy. We have seen it in Scottish local authorities in the past, and in the islands council all the way through. We found a way round it by having regional and district councils—two-tier local authorities. Now we are going back to the problem of single-tier authorities. It is incumbent on the Government and the Committee to accept that they are disqualifying many people as well as imposing an unreasonable restriction on the local democractic process. It will not do for the Minister to shake his head. The Committee should demand that he tackles the problem seriously.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the Minister was most helpful at the end of his speech, by admitting that there would be a problem. That acceptance and his invitation to suggest a solution were also helpful.<br><br>
I talked to the Minister outwith the Committee. Perhaps I can illustrate one of the strange anomalies, or ironies, of what will happen. Heaven forbid we go ahead with three Ayrshire authorities. In Kyle and Carrick, the leader of the Tory group, Councillor Murray Tosh, a teacher at Belmont academy, will no longer be eligible to stand for the new south Ayrshire authority, but Councillor Ian Welsh, the leader of the Labour group, who is also a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0249">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 439</span>
teacher—but at Auchinleck academy in what would be east Ayrshire—would be eligible. From a political viewpoint, that has attractions for me. [An HON. MEMBER: "Yes, we know that."]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely that is an awfully good argument against an all-Ayrshire authority, because, if that were created, neither would be able to stand.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is perceptive. I anticipated his saying that. That is the only argument against an all-Ayrshire authority.<br><br>
I know Murray Tosh and Ian Welsh. As the Minister expects, I agree strongly with one, and disagree strongly with the other, but respect both. As we move towards the direct management of schools, with teachers' salaries and conditions of service determined nationally, I do not see why either should be disbarred irrespective of where they work, or live. Ian Welsh is an assistant head teacher; Murray Tosh is a principal teacher. Neither has less responsibility than we as Members do for judging these things. Some guidelines may be needed, and I shall put a couple of suggestions to the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the hon. Gentleman's comments, with which I identify, why does he think that Councillor Tosh is so strongly in favour of south Ayrshire when he is so committed to his council work that it is a case of someone putting the interests of the people around him before his own. Is not that commendable?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting point with which I shall not agree or disagree because it would take me away from the main point. I want to be constructive.<br><br>
I suggested that the Minister might have a secret agenda. He described me as expounding a conspiracy theory. It was simply that as he spoke, it occurred to me that Kyle and Carrick had suggested, in the blueprint of its proposed scheme, opting out of schools and flogging off services, and I wondered whether that might be part of the Minister's thinking. The reason I accepted that there was no secret agenda or conspiracy was that the Minister was taken aback by the questions. He had not thought about them. I do not know which official he was talking to, but he consulted repeatedly. It has been shown that there are many problems—not just the obvious ones—which the Minister has not thought through.<br><br>
5.15 pm<br><br>
I hope that, by the end of the debate, there will be agreement in principle that we do not want to disfranchise 300,000 people. If an acceptable way forward can be found, it should be taken.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) and I have said, Members of Parliament have great say in our affairs and activities. There is not an exact parallel with the point about civil servants, but there is an element of the same argument—we must trust councillors within certain guidelines. Indeed, Members of Parliament have certain guidelines.<br><br>
The Minister should consider a two-pronged approach. First, he should examine a range of posts, the holders
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 440</span>
of which could sensibly be excluded from standing, for example, director, deputy director or assistant director. The holders of those jobs are involved in policy recommendations. That has been done before in local government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could not the grades of local authority employees who are debarred from active participation in politics be barred? Such people are already designated in statute.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is what my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) suggested.<br><br>
Secondly, there should be clear guidelines for employees who are elected to councils. There should be reserved areas, such as staffing. If, for example, an employee who worked for the cleansing department was elected, he would not be able to sit on a committee dealing with his department. That would be a restriction, but it is better than his not being allowed to stand, and he would not be able to be involved in telling his director what to do.<br><br>
Perhaps that would be too restrictive and areas within committees might have to be examined, but it is not beyond the wit of woman or man to produce a set of guidelines which would deal with conflicts that might arise, such as the awkward situation of an employee having a major say to his director. What is needed is a combination of the restriction—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman, who has substantial experience of local government, knows that it is not unusual to restructure departments only for it to be found that individuals are no longer accountable to the chap to whom they were previously accountable. Might structural changes carried out by a council mean that a person who was elected on the understanding that he would not be involved in certain activities could later work in a department of which he is the convener?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, such a situation might arise, but only seldom. Arrangements could be made for it. The Minister should consider setting up a small working group involving local authorities. They should not be asked to think of the problems, but they should be given a specific remit. After hearing the Minister's remarks, I am sure that neither side of the Committee wants to disfranchise 300,000 people. A small working group—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are not disfranchising anyone; no one will be prevented from voting. The hon. Gentleman might also wish to consult his friends on Cumnock and Doon Valley district council. They are in favour of the status quo.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, the status quo is Strathclyde, and Cumnock and Doon Valley.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Cumnock and Doon Valley district council is in favour of continuing with the position whereby council employees cannot stand for membership of the council under the new system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister knows, I have great respect for the 10 Labour councillors, the chief executive and all the staff of Cumnock and Doon Valley district
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0250">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 441</span>
council. However, that does not imply that I agree with them on everything.<br><br>
I accept the Minister's point that "disfranchise" was probably not the right word to use, but we are taking from 300,000 people a basic right to stand for the local council and serve their community. If that is the Committee's intention, we should tell a small working party to look at the restricted posts, try drawing up guidelines and show the Minister the results. We may find that that cannot be done, but it is worth a try. I hope that the Minister finds those suggestions constructive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall make a brief contribution. I have listened with interest to Opposition Members talking about secret agendas, and I am beginning to wonder what their secret agenda is. Equally, I wonder how big this problem is.<br><br>
Opposition Members have said that some seats will not be contested if we do not permit local government employees to stand for election to the councils. I have looked at the results of a survey carried out in 1985 regarding the number of councillors working for local government. Of the roughly 60 per cent. of councillors who were in employment, only about 10 per cent. worked in local government. Therefore, out of the 1,681 councillors in Scotland, only 168 or so worked in local government. Under the new single-tier structure, there will be fewer councillors in Scotland. Therefore, more people who are currently councillors will want to stand for election to councils. If we take the 168 out, I do not think that there will be any problem.<br><br>
I come back to accountability. Council employees carry out functions designated by the council, which is made up of representatives elected by the taxpayer. I do not see why Opposition Members are arguing so strongly for something that it seems the majority of district and regional councils accept is not in anyone's best interests. They are quite happy for the status quo to remain—clearly, there will be no conflict of interest or problems with accountability.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The problem is not that few council employees take up their right to be councillors but that their right to stand for election in the first place is being taken away.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If one accepts the Minister's point, they will not be disfranchised—they will still be able to vote. But, as they are employed by the councils, they have an interest in virtually everything that is discussed in council meetings. I strongly believe that there should be some independence and that local government employees should not be permitted to stand for election to the council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has suggested that not many people will be affected, but let us be specific. Councillor Pat Fawcett represents the Lammermuir ward of East Lothian district council, a large rural area. She is very widely respected by the people in the small villages. She has served the community for years. She is employed as a part-time social worker by Lothian regional council. Why should she not be allowed to stand for the new local authority, even though she is willing to do so and the local people support her?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 442</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, there will be individual cases in which interests must be declared at certain times. The new councils will have to consider their entire operation and decide whether to carry on as they are or to reduce their numbers to achieve greater efficiency. Council employees, with due respect, will have vested interests. Therefore, they are not the best people to sit in judgment on themselves. Reference has been made to local enterprise companies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The logic of the argument of the hon. Member for East Lothian is that the new council in the area could have a majority of social workers. To criticise that is not to criticise social workers, but that would clearly be absurd.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I could not agree more. The analogy with LECs is that, as far as I am aware, LEC employees, the executives of LECs, are not permitted to sit on the boards of LECs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman sure?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am virtually certain, but perhaps my hon. Friend the Minister could confirm that when he winds up. I am sure that they do not sit on the boards. They may sit at the boards and advise members, but I am fairly certain that they do not sit on the boards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are 53 executive directors of health boards in Scotland who are paid as managers by the boards on which they sit as voting members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friend the Minister was trying to intervene on the intervention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is important to understand what has been said. The hon. Member for East Lothian referred to 53 executive directors. That is exactly what they are—executive directors. There is a distinction in law for executive directors who work as executives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand what my hon. Friend says. The majority of those on a health board could not work for that board. Imagine trying to organise the system so that a certain number of councillors could be employees of a council. It would not be workable. It would have to be specified that one ward could have as councillor an employee of the council, but that another one could not. How could a democratic voting system enable that to operate?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian said that 53 employees—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Executive directors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Employees of health boards sit on the boards. What is the difference between employees of health boards sitting on boards and employees of councils sitting on councils?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the hon. Gentleman listened to my response to the intervention. The majority on a health board are clearly not allowed to come from among the employees of that board.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0251">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 443</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not it astonishing that Labour members criticise employees of health boards being executive directors of them when that was exactly the position under the previous Labour Government? There is no change in the rules for health boards or for local authorities from the rules that applied under the previous Labour Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The majority of responses to the consultation document clearly favoured the status quo. If there is doubt, it is safer to avoid a conflict of interest that is apparent to the majority of electors in Scotland. If one excluded the views of the 300,000 employees, the majority of the remainder of Scottish people would see that the status quo is there as a protection for them as the ratepayers. Every time I heard the Opposition mention the 300,000 local government employees, I squirmed and realised that the sooner we get on with this local government reform and introduce some rationalisation, the better.</span></p>
<p>5.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I note that those dangers should be avoided in elected local councils, but we have not discussed unelected quangos, which is interesting.<br><br>
I am not sure whether I have to declare an interest, but my wife is a serving councillor. If the council changes to the Angus region and, if Angus was the education authority, as a teacher she would not be eligible to serve. I find it ludicrous that such a serving councillor, with 16 years of service in local government and of contributing to local affairs, would find that she was no longer able to speak on any district service. She would also be banned from speaking in relation to roads, planning and other services outside the area of education. It is not beyond the wit of human beings to find some way in which interest can be openly declared and the problem met.<br><br>
I commend the practical points made by the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley. The problem should not be left; it should be studied again because of its size. We are debating a fundamental, democratic right of a citizen in his or her own area to stand and be of service to that community. That right has been taken away from many people. There should be transparency and openness of declaration of interest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I follow the hon. Gentleman's point. He is suggesting presumably that all teachers should be able to stand as councillors for the new authorities. That could result in a situation in which every councillor was a teacher. Does he think that that is sensible?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that is a sensible proposition. It is up to the electorate: all candidates must stand and be approved by the electors. I do not think that that situation would arise. I believe that it is not beyond the bounds of human ingenuity to produce a set of rules to ensure that such extreme situations do not affect the running of local authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that one could have 100 per cent. of the council composed of council employees?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an extreme possibility, but then the moon might move out of orbit. The electors must take
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 444</span>
that consideration into account. If only teachers stood, I am sure that the electorate would have the right to reject or accept them.<br><br>
An analogy was made earlier. What is a whole bunch of social workers was elected to council? If they are duly elected by the people, why should not social workers speak about roads, housing and other services? A set of sensible rules could meet such problems—they exist in unelected quangos and the hon. Gentleman is perfectly happy to accept that. He is not accepting that we could get sensible rules for duly elected councillors whom the general public have accepted. It is a fundamental democratic problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is much more than that—it is a structural problem. The hon. Gentleman should be prepared to introduce proposals to say who would be excluded. If he thinks that it is possible to have a situation in which the majority of employees did not run the council, rules would be required to prevent that occurring. That would mean that some people could stand and some could not. It is far better to have a system in which everybody is in the same situation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And take the democratic deficit consequences thereof. It is for the electorate to decide. I make the following point again. There is a general discretion dispensation given by the Secretary of State for present district councillors who are council house tenants to take decisions that affect council housing and rents. As far as I know, there has never been a problem. People openly declare their interest and they take decisions according to the needs of the council.<br><br>
If there is an implication that those who stand cannot be trusted, I find that totally unacceptable. People stand for election and it is up to the electorate to decide whom they wish democratically to have as their representatives. What bothers me is that we are now dealing with the fundamental right of all citizens to participate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am genuinely trying to follow the hon. Gentleman's argument. If he argues that there is a fundamental right, he must also be saying that every local authority employee has the right to stand for a council. Is he putting that proposition to the Committee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have already said that there are already certain prohibited posts and such employees should not be allowed to stand. I am looking for sensible rules. Directors of services should clearly not be able to stand for council, but that is exactly the point made by the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley. Instead of giving up on the problem as the Minister clearly has he should be investigating it urgently and in depth. This fundamental right will not go away without democracy itself suffering.<br><br>
According to the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, the measure would disqualify 300,000 council employees which is approximately 7 per cent. of the adult population. That vast swathe of adults are allowed to vote, but not to stand or serve within their local community. That is not what local democracy should be all about. We are banning these people from democratic participation in local councils as elected councillors. It is the size of the problem that creates the difficulty.<br><br>
The Government are creating larger authorities and fewer councillors. They are imposing more
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0252">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 445</span>
responsibilities yet they are immediately barring large sections of the population. Larger local goverment units will mean that physical distance will prevent service in neighbouring councils. As an inevitable result, those 300,000 citizens will be debarred from what is a fundamental democratic right.<br><br>
In certain areas, local authorities will be the major employers thus debarring a large number of people from standing for election and contributing to their local authority. Teachers are an obvious group that will be excluded. What about home helps and nursery nurses? Will the measure extend to the most marginal part-time person employed by the council? Will they be debarred from the participating? The rule becomes quite ludicrous.<br><br>
It is fundamental to democracy that councils should truly reflect the nature of their local community. By debarring this large number of people the Government are preventing that. A council might become lopsided with only an elite or limited group having the time or resources to become councillors. To the time and resources handicap the Government are adding this bar to a large number of people throughout the country. All political parties know that it is difficult enough now to get people to come forward to serve on local government. This is adding to that difficulty. Democracy will suffer.<br><br>
Transparency and declaration are at the heart of this. If people know who is standing for council, and if councillors declare who they are and their interest openly, the rest of us can judge them by their actions. The present system allows council tenants to take decisions on rents and rates. I have heard no criticism of how that has worked.<br><br>
The proposed blanket ban is too restrictive and with fewer councils it will cause a further increase in the democratic deficit. Although there are difficulties, it would be better to make the effort right now and energetically devise a system of declaration and open transparency of interests. Citizens should be allowed to participate in local government decision making if that is the wish of the local electorate.<br><br>
It is both unjust and undemocratic to place an automatic bar on council employees from standing for election in their own council while allowing councillors with business connections with the council to be elected merely to declare an interest. The democratic interest would be best served by lifting the bar on all local government employees while establishing a detailed code of declaration of interests which would be so all-encompassing that it would prevent employees in the most senior posts from standing for election to council because they would be unable to represent their constituents effectively.<br><br>
Democracy is the ultimate loser under this Government proposal and I plead with the Minister to reconsider the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has not dealt with—it is easily dealt with—the point raised by Conservative Members about the spectre of all the councillors being social workers. I suppose that it could happen. I suppose that, in theory, they could all be one-legged, black—I will not go on, strike that from the record! The selection of candidates is a matter over which the parties have some power and surely they will exercise
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 446</span>
responsibility and judgment when choosing candidates. They will take account of such factors.<br><br>
I recall the days of the all-progressives on Edinburgh corporation. We were near the stage where all the progressive councillors elected were people who had contracts with the council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman once again displays his vast depth of practical experience in local authorities. I take the point that he makes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, according to the Minister's logic, it would be impossible for someone who works for a DLO or a DLO at arm's length from the council—acting as a contractor for the council—to be a councillor simply because he is an employee, however indirectly, of that council?<br><br>
Is it not so, however, that if the current Kyle and Carrick fiasco were taken to its logical conclusion, someone could perhaps set himself up to be a legal consultant? The director of administration could be a legal consultant and be paid thousands of pounds by the council to give it legal advice, but he would still be eligible to be a councillor.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, that reveals the democratic deficit. We want people who are democratically elected and democratically accountable on the councils, if the electorate so wish. I hope that the Minister will respond to those and the other points made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to finish. Perhaps the hon. Member for Ayr can make his own speech. I do not wish to speak for too long. I have only a few more words to say.<br><br>
I take the point made by the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley. We need a thriving democracy. That is partly up to the political parties; they have to recruit people into the democratic process. The Government, however, are trying to restrict eligible people from entering that democratic process. We should all be the losers by that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise to speak because this is probably one of the more fundamental issues that we shall discuss. We are discussing how councils in Scotland in future will be managed and run and how they will be held to be open and accountable.<br><br>
Let us examine the Opposition's proposal. They say that we are excluding people from the democratic process. That is true in that they will be unable to stand for the councils for which they work. There is nothing new in that. As was explained, civil servants, the armed forces and the police are restricted in many different ways. It is a fact that, in certain occupations, people are not allowed to do certain things. They know what the rules are and what the score is.<br><br>
The concern expressed is perhaps about the few people—the hon. Member for Angus, East drew attention to this—who may work in a regional department and be councillors in a current district council and who, if the rules are changed, will be unable to work as a councillor for the new authority, or vice-versa. We are speaking of a limited number of people. The question arises: should
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0253">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 447</span>
structures be established that will continue for many years—for ever, we hope—on the basis that a few people may be affected now? The Committee must quite properly tackle that issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A limited number of people may have taken the opportunity to become councillors. However, a massive number of people—300,000—will lose the right to stand for election as councillors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That right will apply only to those who are currently councillors in one authority, who are not employed by another authority. If one works for a district or region, one is able to stand for election for another council.<br><br>
5.45 pm<br><br>
As the rules stand, one is not able to stand for one's own council. The changes will affect only a handful of people. We should ask whether we are establishing viable structures that will work properly. That is more important than worrying about a few individuals who will, sadly, be adversely affected. All legislation affects some people. Some people gain by it; others lose by it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty <span class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman listens to others as I listen to him. The hon. Gentleman examines the problem from the wrong perspective. A person who is willing to move boundaries—and perhaps move family and home into another area—to get involved in politics might be the sort of zealot that we do not want in local government. Those who stand for democratic election should represent a broad spectrum of people. The people who are prepared to move may be the sort of people who should not be involved in politics. The 300,000 people that we are discussing are mainly ordinary people with ordinary interests and anxieties, who have no political ambitions or ideologies. The Government would exclude those people from local government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was a helpful intervention. I assure the Committee that I did not pay the hon. Gentleman for it. Many Members of Parliament move house deliberately to get elected to this place. Does he suggest that that is wrong? That is an astonishing judgment from anyone who stands for election. If an individual who lives in Monifieth cares deeply enough to want to stand for Angus district council and decides to move to Broughty Ferry to do so, is that person an unsatisfactory candidate? Such a proposition is appalling. I am astonished by it. I declare an interest, because I moved from the north of England to get elected. I fall into the category that the hon. Gentleman describes. I suppose that no Opposition Member has moved house to get elected; that no Opposition Member from England represents a Scottish constituency and that no Opposition Member from Scotland represents an English constituency. What nonsense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span> <i>rose</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Here is somebody who has moved about a bit.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 448</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. I wish I could find a way of selling a house in Kirkcudbright. If any journalists are present, I would appreciate a plug.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) was a councillor in Stirling, where he lived. He has been elected to represent Falkirk, East. I compliment him for moving to live near his constituents, but he has acted in the way that he criticised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is not about Members of Parliament who do flittings; it is about eligibility for local government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not intend to digress. I merely said that it was possible to move in order to stand for election as a councillor. I said nothing reprehensible. I responded to the hon. Member for Falkirk, East, who said that we did not want the sort of people who move to get elected to be involved in politics. Councillors may or may not be party political, but they are in politics.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span> <i>rose</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will certainly give way. I stress that I have not paid the hon. Gentleman yet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point must be underscored for the hon. Gentleman because he wanted to take it from the wrong perspective. Once again, he failed to address the point made by the hon. Member for Angus, East: that 300,000 ordinary citizens will be debarred. He talked only of those few transitory persons who move into areas to be elected and who may be working for local authorities for which they debarred.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman again failed to address the question of the 300,000 people who will lose the basic democratic right to stand for the council in the area where they live. To have that right, they would have to take menial roles with the council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman failed to hear what I said about the figure that he gave. People are already debarred. His figure is inaccurate. If I worked for a district or regional council, I could not stand for election now. People are effectively debarred from standing for the council for which they work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Gentleman if I am taxing his patience. I hope that I am also taxing his mental energies. If a person lives in a town that is part of a district and a region, that person cannot work for both the district and the region. That person could stand for one council or the other. All the 300,000 people will be debarred in a new way. I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts the logic of that because it is the truth; it cannot be changed by his view or opinion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was merely stating the fact that if one works for a district council, one cannot stand for election to it, so one is debarred. That is a fact of life.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One can stand for the region.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be that one's interests are in leisure, recreation and other areas. One might not want to stand
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0254">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 449</span>
for the regional council. I have never heard such absolute nonsense.<br><br>
If we are to establish structures, we must be confident that they will work effectively and that the people working for them are seen to be accountable. More importantly, the public must have confidence in the integrity of the structures.<br><br>
I did not refer to the Co-operative Society by accident. I did so deliberately. It is a splendid example because the managers and directors are directly accountable to the employees. For example, if someone works in a butcher's shop and he is appointed to the board of a co-operative, his boss is accountable to him. That is one of the structural reasons why the Co-operative Society has never been the dynamic force in the high street that it should and could have been. It has a flawed structure.<br><br>
We must not create flawed structures, especially as vast sums of public money are involved. We must recognise that people should not stand to be elected as councillors for the council with which they are employees.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made serious allegations about the co-operative movement. I declare an interest as a sponsored co-operative Member, for which I am grateful to my fellow co-operators, and I am a director of the Co-operative Press. It is one of the most successful small printing operations; the Co-operative bank is a successful, caring bank; and the CIS is a successful insurance organisation. They are all based on the co-operative principle. I am not sure why the hon. Gentleman thinks that the co-operative principle is flawed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps we can discuss the principles of the co-operative movement later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was giving the best example that I could, by describing an organisation in which employees could be elected to senior positions. If the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley wants to discuss the facts, I can tell him the Co-operative Society's percentage of sales in 1902, and in 1947. I can give its percentage of high street sales today. Whatever the hon. Gentleman thinks about my saying that it is not a dynamic force in the high street, the figures show just what has happened.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley and other hon. Members have mentioned health board directors who happen to be employees. They may be surprised to learn that they have alerted me to something that may need examining. Perhaps those directors should be treated like directors of councils—as non-voting members. The directors of council departments are not voting members, as everyone knows. Decisions are taken by those who are elected. The present health board arrangement may contain a structural flaw. Given my recent problems in Tayside caused by the Tayside health board I must declare an interest. I am not its greatest ally at the moment. I might be persuaded—I probably could be persuaded—that directors ought not to be voting members of health boards. That is because I consider structural fundamentals important.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I take the hon. Gentleman back to his analogy with co-ops? Is that just his view, or does it represent his party's view too? I am surprised, because
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 450</span>
one of the best examples in my area of a recent co-op is Barrhead Sanitaryware, which the Minister was instrumental in setting up and which is chaired by Sir Albert McQuarrie. If that is not a good analogy with what we are discussing, what is?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman has picked on that example, Mr. Martin, because I happen to be a shareholder there as well and I am utterly depressed at the ghastly loss that has been made. I am delighted about the take-over proposal—but I shall discuss that no further.<br><br>
We must build a sound structure and ensure that those who run an organisation, the directors, do not find themselves accountable to people who work for it, at whatever level. I do not suggest that the fact of happening to be a bus driver—a job about which I know something—should debar someone from becoming either a councillor or a Member of Parliament. Everyone should be eligible, but not those who are employees of the organisation in question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the point. The hon. Gentleman is shifting his view on Tayside health board and other quangos. The relevant people in those organisations are not just any employees—they have top posts with full executive and decision-making powers. The Government are unlikely to introduce legislation changing that state of affairs. They condone it, but act in the opposite way over local government, to which members would be elected. The self-same conditions outlawed on the one hand are permitted in the unelected, unaccountable quangos. That is democratically unacceptable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I happen to think that it is because councils are elected public bodies that the structures that we put in place must be able to stand both close examination and the passage of time; and that councillors should not be seen or imagined to have interests contrary to the well-being of the council. That is why it is vital that whoever is elected to the council shall not be an employee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the debate has progressed, little has become clearer, but one thing that is absolutely clear is that the Government have ignored all the Opposition arguments about the Bill's impact on democracy.<br><br>
6 pm<br><br>
The Government have simply shrugged off the fact that 7 per cent. of the adult population will be debarred from standing in council elections; 300,000 people will be deprived of a right that they currently enjoy. I do not accept the argument that because only a fraction of that number exercise that right, it somehow makes it less important. Just because people do not exercise their rights does not mean that they do not value them.<br><br>
For example, we all have the right to walk across Westminster bridge. I seldom exercise that right, mainly because I live in the opposite direction and I have no reason to cross Westminster bridge. But if the Government were to ban people from walking across that bridge, millions would come to London to try to save their right of way because they would not want the Government to take away their rights.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman gets too carried away, he may be interested to know that Dundee district council supports the Government's position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has not heard the whole argument yet—I shall come to it later. It is not surprising that the Government do not listen to democratic arguments; they have ignored the democratic voice in Scotland for years and denied us the Parliament that we continue to vote for. They refuse to hold the referendum that eight out of 10 Scots want, to settle the future government of Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman telling us that the argument advanced by Dundee district council is somehow a disgrace to democracy?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not refer to Dundee district council, unlike the Minister. I referred to the arguments to which I have listened in Committee for the past hour and half, which are a disgrace to democracy, but there is nothing surprising about that. What does surprise me is that the Government have not thought the measure through. That was especially clear from the Minister's response to my intervention.<br><br>
I take the hon. Member back to the character that he invented who lives in Monifieth but works for Dundee district council and can therefore stand for election to the Angus and Mearns district council. When I raised with the Minister the possibility of a councillor who works for Dundee district council participating in joint boards that affect Dundee, he said that it was a matter not for him but for the councils involved, because we were talking about voluntary joint boards.<br><br>
Clause 20 gives the Secretary of State for Scotland the power to establish by order a joint board. There is nothing voluntary about the joint board for police and fire, which will have to be put in place when the Bill is enacted. Dundee and Angus will not decide to form a joint board—they will be told by statute that they must do so.<br><br>
Let us suppose that the character in Monifieth is a civilian worker for the Dundee division of Tayside police and he is elected to Angus council. Could that civilian worker for Tayside police participate in joint board decisions, which could be about his wages and conditions of work as an employee? That is for the Minister, not the councils, to think about.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I intervened before in the hon. Gentleman's speech, it was because I thought that he was referring to voluntary arrangements between councils. He has made it clear that that is not what he is referring to. The position is absolutely clear, although he may not like it: employees of joint boards are disqualified from being members of the joint board.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In effect, the Minister is saying that the people who live in one council area but are employed by a council in an adjoining area can be elected to the council where they live, but not exercise their powers as councillors. They will thus be second-rate councillors: they cannot participate in certain council activities because they are debarred by virtue of being employed by an adjacent council.<br><br>
The Minister is creating two different tiers of councillor in Scotland because he has not properly thought out the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 452</span>
implications of the measure. The reality is that those councillors would not have the same rights as every other councillor in Angus because they would be debarred from taking part in joint boards with Dundee district council.<br><br>
The measure will have a serious impact not just on Dundee and Angus but on councils in the whole of Scotland. The Minister says that I may not like it; councillors will not like it either if they are elected but cannot exercise their powers like every other elected councillor. The Minister has not said much about that distinction in this debate.<br><br>
What about the voluntary agreements? The McKinnon centre in Broughty Ferry in Dundee is a regional centre for Tayside for people with disabilities. A person living in Monifieth could work at that centre. So if Dundee and Angus have a voluntary joint agreement about the running of the McKinnon centre, could that person sit on the joint board, because it is a voluntary agreement between Dundee and Angus which allows the person sitting on the joint board to oversee the work of the McKinnon centre and take decisions about its staff?<br><br>
That is another inconsistency that the Minister has not thought about. If councils an agree to allow the person in question to sit on a joint board dealing with social work facilities, why should not a person who works for the police be permitted to sit on a joint board because it is a mandatory joint board? The measure is riddled with inconsistencies and the only solution is that suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley—that we should decide which categories of council employees would be inappropriate to stand as councillors, and allow everyone outside those categories to stand for whatever council they wanted. That is the way forward.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister, intervening from a sedentary position, asked, "which one?" Does my hon. Friend know whether the Minister has read the Widdicombe report which set out the categories for local councils in Scotland which have been in operation for several years?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. To judge by the clause, the Minister does not seem to be aware of the existence of that report and its recommendations.<br><br>
It seems that the measure's implications have not occurred to the Government. They are sitting in dumb ignorance, not expecting any of the problems to arise. When we point out the problems, the Minister says, "Oh well", because he has not thought out the answer.<br><br>
Why are there so many inconsistencies, such as councillors elected to the same council having different powers and individuals working for the police having rights different from those employed by the social work department? The Minister must explain why that is so.<br><br>
Will the Minister confirm that someone working for the McKinnon centre but elected to Angus council can sit on the joint board agreed between Angus and Dundee for the running of that centre?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall explain the position to the hon. Gentleman clearly and simply. The Government have a consistent position, although the hon. Gentleman may
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0256">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 453</span>
not agree with it. It is perfectly straightforward: employees of joint boards are disqualified from being members of the joint board, but an employee of one of the constituent authorities of the joint board can be a member of the joint board. The key question is whether someone is an employee of the authority to which he or she wants to be elected. That is the simple, clear, consistent principle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Say it slowly, Allan.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should indeed say it slowly: he appears to be saying that an employee of one of the constituent councils can be a member of the joint board. The person who lives in Monifieth and works for the McKinnon centre can sit on the joint board that runs the McKinnon centre. That is what the Minister is saying. Or perhaps that is not what the Minister is saying—a civil servant appears to be putting him right. Is the Minister saying that the person who lives in Monifieth and is elected to Angus council but works for the Dundee division of Tayside police cannot sit on the joint board? It is a statutory joint board which involves those two councils and Perth and Kinross.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend come to the conclusion that I have reached in the past hour or two, that now we are in a terrible fankle about boundaries and about this issue? We are therefore probably better off keeping the present system until we have a Scottish Parliament that will set up an independent committee to consider the problem in more detail, to establish a proper system. These problems could then be solved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman has gone wide of the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought for one moment that my hon. Friend was going to say that a Scottish Parliament could set up an independent Scotland, but I felt sure that he did not mean that.<br><br>
The Minister seems to have gone back on what he said earlier. At one point he said that people would not be debarred from serving on a joint police and fire board, but could not participate in a joint board pursuing social work issues. He seems to be saying two things at the same time. If I am wrong, perhaps the Minister will put me right. Can the person who works in the Dundee area but was elected to the Monifieth council take part in joint boards where there are voluntary agreements between the two councils, but not take part in joint boards where there is a statutory requirement placed on the two councils?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At the risk of repeating myself, I shall take the advice of my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson). I thought that the hon. Gentleman was referring originally to voluntary joint arrangements. The position of employees on joint boards is quite clear. They are disqualified from being members of the joint board, but an employee of one of the board's constituent authorities can be a member. It could not be any clearer than that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is very clear. The character who fives in Monifieth and was elected to the council, but works in the Tayside police division, can take part in the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 454</span>
joint board's decision on terms and conditions. He has a special privilege that other people working in the Dundee division of Tayside do not have. They cannot take part in any decisions about their jobs and conditions, but he can do so because he was elected to an adjacent council, the Angus council, which is across the Dundee boundary.<br><br>
Two types of employee will be working for local authorities in Dundee: those who live in Dundee and are disadvantaged because they are debarred from holding office on joint boards, and those who live in council areas around Dundee and can take part in joint boards that take decisions about the conditions and wages of employees in Dundee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It seems that the Minister earlier today and everyone in the Committee admitted that there is a system of politics based on political parties in local authorities. We have the situation in which someone who could not be on a joint board might be sitting in a party group or any party—an independent group, or Conservative or Labour—discussing the business of a joint board because he thinks that it is relevant to his constituents, but in reality he would never be able to go on that board. Will the Minister table an amendment so that a person cannot sit and discuss the business with his colleague on a board? It makes nonsense of what the Government are doing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Interventions should be brief. Mr. McAllion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Martin, if I could just finish my point—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. Mr. McAllion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend made a fair point. He was beginning to develop it and I am sure that the Minister listened carefully.<br><br>
There is another inconsistency. Not all council employees will be treated in the same way: it will depend on where they happen to live. Employees who live outwith the council's area will have more rights than those who live in the area.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As at present.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At present people who work and live in Dundee have two tiers of local government and they can choose to serve in one or the other, whichever does not employ them. The Government have now taken that choice away from them by abolishing the two-tier structure and introducing a unitary structure. These people will be denied a right that they currently have. That is the central issue.<br><br>
The Minister may shrug and smile and Conservative Members may make funny remarks across the Committee, but people will be denied a right that they now have. The Government are forcing through a measure that they have not thought out properly and which will lead to inconsistencies. There will be different categories of employee; one with no rights and another with some rights depending on residence. Any measure that is riddled with inconsistencies to the point that it becomes laughable should be thrown in the dustbin, which is what the Scottish people will eventually do to the Government.</span></p>

People should be excluded if there is a genuine case for excluding them, but not if it is simply for administrative convenience. I used to be the chair of the Scottish Joint Negotiating Committee—[HON. MEMBERS: "Chairman, please."] I was the chair of the SJNC, which negotiated teachers' terms and conditions. It would have been inappropriate for a teacher to have been on the management's side as an elected member helping to determine his or her terms and conditions and salary. Nothing in the proposed rules will prevent that. A teacher on one authority could be an elected member of another, and could sit on the SJNC and determine his own terms and conditions. That shows that the regulations proposed by the Minister are flawed.<br><br>
I accept that there is a problem with people being able to determine their own terms and conditions and to intervene directly in their own structures. The Minister's deliberate decision goes too wide. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Would it help, Mr. Martin, if I stopped talking until the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South has finished his conversation, or should I continue?<br><br>
There is nothing wrong with a housing officer being on the social work committee, or a social worker being on the education committee, or someone who works in the roads department being able to contribute to education. I accept that none of those people should be on the committee that determines their own service. How do we prevent people intervening inappropriately? There should be two standards. Some people will be involved in giving policy advice, as at present, but if people are elected to a local authority they should not be eligible to serve on a committee that determines their own rewards structure. That would allow teachers to stand for any authority but not to be on the education committee, social workers to stand for any authority but not to be on the social work committee or on the personnel committee that determines their own structure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can see the hon. Gentleman's logic, but we have no idea what will happen at an election—we have only to ask the Canadians about that. We must not put in place structures that could not deal with the situation in which one segment of the population only was elected. If that happened there could be a council largely made up of teachers or social workers. That is the root of the problem and the hon. Gentleman must deal with it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that point, but if we are dealing with hypotheticals, I shall come on to that in a moment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Members cannot have it both ways. They proclaimed that few employees are elected to councils. Now they are offering us the spectre of a council that will be full of nothing but employees. That is a ludicrous proposition. Ultimately, it is up to the electorate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Let me deal with the proposition that the council would be full of social workers. It is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 456</span>
possible, even under the Government's proposed rules, for an entire council, such as East Renfrew or Glasgow, to be composed entirely of teachers, social workers or road workers from other authorities. I do not believe that there would not be an impact on their authority if a selfish interest was pursued. If they voted in their interest to divert money and resources to their service at the expense of others, the climate of opinion within local authorities would change. That would have a knock-on effect. More money and attention might be put into, for example, the COSLA bodies that deal with their service.<br><br>
Even if there was a problem such as that suggested by the hon. Member for Tayside, North, the existing rules would not necessarily stop it. Circumstances in which any rule could be abused or misused can always be identified, but that is not necessarily the way in which we should determine how the system is established.<br><br>
My understanding of the Government's view about joint boards is that, for example, a fireman could not be on one because it is a statutory joint board. It would, however, be possible for an education adviser, for example, to be on a voluntarily established joint board that was responsible for the education advisory service for Renfrewshire. An education adviser employed by West Renfrew, East Renfrew or Greenock councils could be on the board because it was a voluntary organisation. That is an anomaly and the Government rules do not preclude it, though they should.<br><br>
A sensible system of not allowing someone to be involved in a board if he or she has a direct financial or career interest would be much more sensible than having a blanket rule.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may clarify the point for the hon. Gentleman. A joint board must be a statutory body by definition. There can be joint arrangements and joint committees for education or other matters, but a joint board has to be statutory.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, my terminology was incorrect. A committee that was established by a joint arrangement and ran for example, the Renfrewshire or the Ayrshire education advisory service could easily have an education adviser as its chair under the Government's proposed rules, even though he was employed by an authority. It is anomalous and morally incorrect that the Government rules would not stop that.<br><br>
I recognise what you are trying to do and in many ways agree with the prohibition that you are suggesting. You have gone about it in the wrong way. The net is cast too—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have asked the hon. Gentleman before to be careful about the terms that he uses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Martin. I was using normal speech as distinct from the stilted speech that we are required to use here.<br><br>
The system that is being established misses some of the targets that it should be hitting and hits some of the targets that it should be missing. The Minister suggested that he was prepared to examine elements of that again, which would be helpful.<br><br>
The Minister discussed Strathclyde and the question of leave of absence without pay. I understood him to refer
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0258">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 457</span>
to a councillor who was working for and serving on an authority who, if he did not take leave of absence without pay, would be paid twice by the same authority. The Minister seemed to imply that he would have to take leave of absence without pay for his period of service as an elected member. Perhaps he could examine that. If a person is on an authority and working for it, he should not be paid twice by the same authority during one period of time.<br><br>
I want to discuss the question of vested interests. Conservative Members have genuine anxieties about them, and the Minister has to acknowledge that Labour Members have justifiable anxieties too. The Government's proposals do not deal with them.<br><br>
It is possible under the Government's rules for every member of an authority to have a vested interest in council services being privatised or put out to competitive tender because he or she might work for or own companies that intend to bid for contracts. That person might work for a voluntary organisation which has bid or intends to bid for local authority contracts. That is not caught by the Bill; it should be if the Government want to avoid vested interests. The Government are not treating like with like: those in the private sector are not being treated equally with those in the public sector.<br><br>
How would the Government deal with people on an authority being able to vote for a road proposal that will benefit them directly because of property value increases? That is an element of personal betterment which is not caught by the Government's rules. Such things are generally caught informally in local authorities by system of checks and balances—people's interest are known, so they tend to stand back. It is impossible to devise a system of declaration of interests that will catch every eventuality. What system would catch the problem of a road proposal and increased property prices?<br><br>
The Government should not be drawing up a debarment scheme that is so wide as to rule out the possibility that everybody standing for a local authority is a social worker. The net is being drawn far too widely just to catch such an anxiety.<br><br>
The point about local enterprise councils that has been made by my hon. Friends raises questions that have not been adequately dealt with by the Government, but the Minister stresses that he wants them caught. LEC members can vote to set up systems of training grants for which, they might believe, their company could bid and from which they might profit. There is nothing in the existing system that would stop that. It is the equivalent of teachers voting for their own salary.<br><br>
People on an LEC could vote for a system or a land purchase from which they or their company might benefit, especially if the land was for development. Furthermore, the company might be in a better position to benefit from industrial development and the LEC's priorities.<br><br>
There is a danger that you are guilty of a system of double standards. I understand why you are saying what you are saying about the LECs—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is the rule of the Committee that hon. Members should not use the term "you". When the hon. Gentleman uses the term "you", he is addressing me and blaming me for double standards and such things. All I can say to the hon. Gentleman is that although the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 458</span>
rule may not be to his liking, it is the rule of the Committee. If he does not like it, he will have to try to change the Standing Orders. I cannot allow this to continue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. You are right, Mr. Martin, I do not like the rule, but I am not breaking it deliberately. As I am speaking the word naturally slips out. I apologise if you feel that I am doing it deliberately because—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. If it keeps slipping out, I shall have to tell the hon. Gentleman to be seated. It is as simple as that. I ask the hon. Gentleman to continue. He knows the rules.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government are in grave danger of being guilty of double standards because the rules that are being drawn for local authorities are far tighter than the rules that the Government are prepared to accept about LECs. The Government should be fairer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In each of the examples that the hon. Gentleman offered about LECs, any director who noticed that there might be a potential conflict of interest would have to declare it and would not be permitted to vote. That point was fully covered in the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs on Monday.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is certainly not my understanding, relative to the way in which money can be allocated under subject headings or grant systems. A member of a LEC board in direct receipt of money should, properly, declare that. When establishing systems from which he might draw money in the future, that could be easily be done.</span></p>
<p>6.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I understand the trend of the hon. Gentleman's case, it is that he understands why the Government are introducing what he sees as fairly tight rules. Is his complaint that that does not apply to other areas? It may surprise him to learn that some of us agree that things need tightening, and support him. That is no case, however, for not having what we want in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for making the point. I did not mention LECs simply to argue that local authorities should be treated the same. The LECs are too slack, but the Government's proposals for local authorities are far to tight. We ought to move towards the median of the two extremes.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will reconsider the matter. He has conceded that there are genuine difficulties and we accept that. But his brushstrokes are too wide and exclude too many people. I come back to my original point: in principle we ought try to include people in the democratic process and not just as a—bureaucratic nicety. We do not agree with sweeping rules that exclude more than is neccessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood <span class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Minister for missing the first 10 minutes of his speech. I was unavoidably delayed.<br><br>
I wonder whether members of the Committee are not making too much of a meal of this issue. The subject is important and should be discussed. If I understood that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0259">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 459</span>
part of the Minister's speech that I did hear, he said that if a system can be found and reduced to writing, he is prepared to take it away and consider it. If that is so, he puts the onus back on us to devise a workable system that would pass his tests of practicablility.<br><br>
To make that possible, the Minister must give us a bit of a steer. He has gone some way to ruling out unacceptable systems, but he owes it to the Committee to give us an idea of what he seeks in an acceptable system. If he does that, I undertake to read the record of this important debate and table a concrete amendment later in the Bill's proceedings here, or for its consideration in the other place, to meet his needs. It would help the Committee if he spent a moment or so fleshing out what is needed, so that we can consider whether that can be met by a tangible amendment later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are pleased that the Government are enthusiastic about continuing the debate on this important item. Hon Gentlemen on both sides the Committee have made excellent contributions. We are happy to stick to the issues and and make sure the members of the Committee have every opportunity to deal with whatever they wish.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside made some interesting interventions. On the conflict of interests question, he said that it was fundamental that employees of local government cannot be elected to a council because they are invoved in policy decisions and could influence their own careers and well-being.<br><br>
In relation to quangos such as health boards, the hon. Gentleman did not accept the point that my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian made about 53 executive directors being involved in health boards. An executive director who is a general manager, director of public health, has a fundamental interest in his own affairs in terms of his activities in the health board structure.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman for Kincardine and Deeside said he was worried about a workers' coup in Glasgow, where all employees were elected to the council. I want to tackle him about that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is that an Ayrshire coup?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It could be, if we were talking about Ayrshire. In this case it is a Glasgow coup.<br><br>
Lothian health board has five non-executive directors, and five executive directors. That is a near-majority on a health board, which consists of the general manager, the director of public health, the director of finance, the director of operations and the director of planning and development. The inconsistency of the argument has been exposed because it is a health board on which officers—paid employees—have a near majority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. What has membership of Glasgow health boards and the LEGS to do with the amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Fife, Central is making comparisons and I have allowed him some leeway. These matters may, of course, be mentioned in passing, but the hon. Gentleman must keep within the terms of the amendment.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 460</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I give way to the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman made an interesting point about the Glasgow health board. As my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North said, we are discussing what we do for local government. There may be areas which we should like tightened, and we might like there to be boards that could not have a majority vested interest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am intrigued to see Conservative party policy unfolding before our eyes. If the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside wishes further to discuss the democratising of the health board structure, to end the practice of paid officials, in Lothian, for example, being able to influence their own pay, we shall be willing to discuss it with him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made my case. If a structure is in place, we in Parliament have put it there. If it is shown to be flawed, as the hon. Gentleman judges—and I have sympathy with what he says—we bear responsibility because we put it in place. We must not repeat those mistakes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that intervention. At least two Conservative Members are willing to debate the matter as it relates to health boards. I mention that only in passing, Mr. Martin, as you suggested.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend be willing to allow the Minister to intervene? After all, he is the health spokesman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can do nothing to encourage interventions by the Minister, but, if he wishes, he must feel free to speak after his two hon. Friends, and make it clear that there should be a review of health boards on which employees have a near-majority. I am happy to continue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The issue arises from a point that I made. On February 3, the Minister, replying to a question from me, listed the 53 paid members of health boards in Scotland. Interestingly, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Executive members of health boards are those who are employees of the board. They are all voting members. The present executive members are listed. Salaries are determined by the boards and details are not held centrally.—[<i>Official Report;</i> 3 February 1994; Vol. 236, c.910.]</p></blockquote>
Where is the accountability there?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. We can tidy up the conflict of interest issue by suggesting that we have exposed many different anomalies in various quangos. If members of the Committee want to attack the possibility of having conflicts of interest in local government, they should be aware of the fact that fundamental conflicts of interest, occur every day of the week, every week of the year, in quangos throughout the length and breadth of Scotland.<br><br>
We should dismiss the attack on the possibility of conflicts of interest. Of course there will be conflicts of interest in local government, but we must put the problem
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0260">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 461</span>
into perspective and ensure that an argument over quangos is not traded against elected involvement by employees in local government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that my hon. Friend would make the following point. He might want to differentiate between people who are listed as non-executive directors of the health board and who are senior policy makers and people who would be banned under this regulation who earn their day-to-day crust by doing a menial task for the local authority. That difference should be underlined in any system. It is not underlined by the Government's proposed system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. I was attacking the issue from the point of view of a potential conflict of interest over pay levels. We now have a situation in which the five members of Lothian health board could influence policy either to their own advantage or to the advantage of any vested interest group in the community. That cannot be right and I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East for bringing that point to my attention.<br><br>
A whole range of other issues have emerged about this matter—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Vital.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton said, those issue are vital to the futue of the 300,000 local government employees in Scotland. If there is one single issue that the Government have missed it is the scale of the exclusion in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A week last Monday I Was in Stornoway, and much has been made about the experiences of the Western Isles and the unitary authority there. There is considerable displeasure at the fact that many people there are excluded from the democratic process. They include many women who are home helps who may be working only a handful of hours a week, but who find that their chance of representing their local communities in the council disappears. People made that point to me repeatedly when I went to Stornoway to launch the panel of candidates standing historically for the first time in that part of the world. They are fine people and they find it absurd—as we do here—that huge swathes of people will be excluded from representing their communities on the local councils.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an excellent point which does not require comment. We have argued consistently that we accept that restrictions may have to occur if there is the possibility of employees being elected to the council for which they work.<br><br>
My hon. Friend made the point about home helps. Is anybody in his right mind willing to exclude a home help, who is probably a pillar of the community and who wishes to serve the public? She may work for two hours for a local authority—let us say the Western Isles—yet she cannot stand for the council. What element of natural justice is involved there?<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East brought to my attention another issue that Ministers have ignored. In rural areas, such as the Western Isles and Highland
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 462</span>
region, why are so many seats uncontested? Is not it logical to assume that, because of the scale, isolation and geography, many people in such areas work for the local authority and cannot participate? Is it healthy that, in 1982 in the highland region, 50 per cent. of the seats were uncontested?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I speak with experience of a rural authority and of uncontested wards, in which the sitting member has been returned. Without exception, the individuals were outstanding members—regardless of their political persuasion. They were elected because of their popularity. In rural areas that is important. It is often more important than political colour.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I could not take issue with hon. Member. Again, it is not a reflection on the quality of members we return from rural areas, whether SNP, Liberal, Labour, Conservative or independent. The hon. Member made a valuable point. Why should we diminish the pool of talent in a single-tier authority? We want the very best in our councils to reflect the public interest.<br><br>
6.45 pm<br><br>
The debate has also shown that the Opposition have a presumption that we should always strengthen democratic principles and never undermine them. We also have the presumption that we should always look at a problem and, even if it is difficult, try to find a way forward.<br><br>
The Minister made great play of the Montgomery inquiry; he has made great play of the fact that in England and Wales council employees cannot stand for election to the council that employs them. However, if we have no pride in our craft in Scotland, are we as politicians to give up on the issue?<br><br>
We have accepted that there is a problem. There could be conflicts of interest. But are Ministers really not willing to fine up with people who want to find solutions to problems? That is what we want to do. If the Minister will give us a commitment to reconsider we hope that local authorities, hon. Members on both sides and the Scottish Office will look at the matter. I regard this as a challenge, not as a closed door on an issue that will affect 300,000 people. This is a vital part of the debate.<br><br>
It has been argued that it is a fundamental point of principle that employees who work for a council cannot be involved in policy development. We have debunked that myth today by talking about the health boards and the near majorities in our health authorities. If we are worried about policy, why do we not again accept the wisdom and advice of my hon. Friends to consider groups of employees who, because of their involvement and seniority, possibly may not participate?</span></p>
<p>[SIR JAMES KILFEDDER <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
<p>Although a blanket coverage of 300,000 employees all participating and standing for councils might not be possible, we are offering an olive branch by conceding there are difficulties. With all the charity that has been offered by the Opposition, the Government would be severly embarrassed if they walked away from this issue and left 300,000 employees with no right to involve themselves. As reasonable people, the Minister and his
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0261">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 463</span>
hon. Friends should surely be willing to embrace our overtures here.</p>
<p>As the hon. Member for Tayside, North pointed out, we value our local goverment staff. They produce excellent work. We are proud that our public servants in local government make such a valuable contribution. I think the hon. Member would agree that we should think long and carefully before excluding them from extending that involvement as employees into further involvement as representatives of the community. We do not apologise for the time we have taken on this. All hon. Members agree that it has been an important debate.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have just read the article by the Prime Minister in the <i>Daily Express</i> headed,
<br><blockquote><p>"What I mean by Back to Basics".</p></blockquote>
He does not mention this at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am astonished by that revelation, but I have no doubt that it is true. It is clearly an omission because back to basics in relation to local government and employee involvement is crucial. We do not hear so much about back to basics from the Government now, but surely the basics of this debate are the 300,000 employees in Scotland who perform such a valuable service. As basic—<i>[Interruption.]</i><br><br>
I was hoping for an intervention from the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South.<br><br>
As a generous person, I have said that the Government seem keen to continue to debate the issue. We do not want to let them down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Prime Minister is travelling to Scotland tonight. It is alleged that he will have breakfast tomorrow in Glasgow, or perhaps in Edinburgh, with a group of people who just happen to be those who fund the Tory party in Scotland. They probably also serve on many quangos. Is it not possible that among that group at breakfast will be Councillor Murray Toshe, who, as my hon. Friend pointed out, will be debarred from serving on his local authority? Is it not conceivable that Councillor Murray Toshe might draw these vital points to the Prime Minister's attention tomorrow morning?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I do not know whether Councillor Murray Toshe will be present. I want to concentrate on the employee aspects of the debate and not go down a road that will incur your wrath, Sir James. However, I have heard that there is a bed-and-breakfast place in Ben Wyvis drive, which could accommodate all those attending the breakfast tomorrow.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What did the hon. Gentleman mean when he said that the Government were trying to prolong the debate? None of my hon. Friends has spoken in the debate. If and when I have an opportunity to respond to Opposition Members' speeches, I shall not take excessive time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Nothing that I have said should be taken as an attack on Conservative Members. We are delighted for all members of the Committee to participate. I take the Minister's remarks at face value. Nothing that I have said can be construed as suggesting that the Government
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 464</span>
are keen to continue the debate throughout the night and into the morning. However, I hope that Conservative Members will participate in the debate.<br><br>
I have been waylaid by that intervention, so I shall not respond further to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was reading a report by Scottish Action on Dementia.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I was more interested in what was said about breakfast.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But, Sir James—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it a point of order or an intervention?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend allowed me to intervene.<br><br>
I recall that, when I worked for it, Age Concern Scotland received a substantial grant from Lothian regional council, of which I was a member. It is arguable that, because I was a director of Age Concern Scotland, I should not have been allowed to stand for Lothian regional council. The body that I worked for was grant-aided by the council. Surely that is relevant to the debate. If it were not, Sir James, you would not have let me say it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. Perhaps, as a director of Age Concern Scotland, he had a conflict of interest. He possibly obtained cash from an organisation in which he influenced policy. From the Government's perspective, that is fundamentally wrong. My hon. Friend thrived on that, but he has since gone down in the world and ended up in this illustrious Committee.<br><br>
As you have said, Sir James, I should not be diverted from the key issue, which is the basic issue of democratic rights. "Back to basics" means nothing if democratic principles, civil liberties and individual rights are not protected by Governments of whatever colour. One of the reasons why we do not have consensus on the issue is the Government's fundamental fear of expanding the frontiers of elected Government in Scotland, as opposed to what they are doing—closing frontiers and creating statutory committees, quangos and cosy cliques for some of their supporters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Sir Hector Monro)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a disgraceful speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Under-Secretary of State will make a contribution very soon. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I have just heard something very unparliamentary but, being a gentleman, I will not say what it was.<br><br>
I spoke earlier today about the scale of the exclusion, and that issue has been debated further. But the Government will not accept that it materially alters the position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On exclusion, the hon. Gentleman has said that home helps could be banned from standing for election to local authorities. Will he comment on Conservative Members' fear that an army of elected home helps could take over the City of Glasgow district council? Will he point out how ludicrous that proposition is?</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a valuable point. I think that the Minister is worried about an army of home helps taking over East Renfrewshire.<br><br>
Being a reasonable person, I think that it is vital that we hear the Minister's response to an excellent, far-reaching debate. I am happy to give him that opportunity, as he is obviously anxious to speak.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity, after a considerable time, to respond to the debate. You would not expect me, Sir James—[HON. MEMBERS: "Preliminary comments."] I hear Opposition members saying that these are preliminary comments. You would not expect me, Sir James, to respond to all the points made by the hon. Member for Fife, Central in his lengthy speech. As he rightly said, this has been a far-reaching debate.<br><br>
I should like to deal with the specific points that have been raised. There has been considerable discussion about conflicts of interest. I make the general point that conflicts of interest can arise for directors of LECs or councillors. They can arise also for Members of Parliament who declare their interests. We need rules about conflicts of interests in all relevant organisations.<br><br>
I hope that I have made the position on joint boards and joint arrangements clear to the hon. Member for Dundee, East.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span> <i>rose</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I see that the hon. Gentleman wishes to repeat what I have already said twice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to clarify that people who work for the police or fire department in any council area are regarded as employees of a joint board, not employees of the council that funds the board.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I repeat what I have already said twice. Employees of a joint board are disqualified from being members of a joint board. That is the position at present. However, an employee of one of the constituent authorities of the joint board can be a member. I imagine that the Mackinnon centre, to which the hon. Gentleman referred, is run by a joint committee of local authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is run by Tayside regional council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I do not understand the hon. Gentleman's problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can explain. Tayside regional council will be abolished, but the Mackinnon centre functions as a regional facility for Dundee, Angus, and Perth and Kinross. We therefore have an interest in it, but, as it will now be located only in Dundee, there will have to be a form of joint arrangement with the other councils regarding continuation of the centre and its funding. Obviously, it will be not a statutory joint board arrangement but a joint committee arrangement. In those circumstances, will people who work for the Mackinnon centre be barred from standing for election to the council?</span></p>

<p>[SIR JAMES KILFEDDER <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
<p>9 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we suspended for dinner, I was responding—satisfactorily, I hope—to the hon. Member for Dundee, East for the third time. Does he want me to repeat it for the fourth time?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was speaking when we suspended so the Minister did not have the opportunity to respond to my point. The interpretation of the clause is that workers in a facility that is run by a joint committee, or is a joint venture between councils, will be allowed to become councillors and to serve on that joint committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall repeat that if a joint committee involving more than one authority runs a centre—the hon. Gentleman may have been referring to three authorities in the case that he mentioned—that committee cannot employ people. One of the authorities, presumably Dundee in the case that he gave, would be the employer and working there would be employees of one or other of the constituent councils. If the centre were run by a joint board, the alternative rules, which I have read out many times, would apply. As I confirmed when I intervened in the well-considered speech of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Davidson), joint boards are only statutory bodies, unlike committees, which are established on a voluntary basis.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is helpful for the Minister to clarify the position in that way. He is saying that it is possible for an employee in such a centre, which is governed not by a formal joint board, but by a joint structure, to be a councillor of the joint organisation that runs the centre. Therefore, as several Conservative Members have said, that person could intervene directly with the immediate superior fine manager. It was stressed that that anomaly should be avoided.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Let us suppose that the employer is Dundee council. An employee at the centre could not at the same time act as an employer. However, there would be no bar for employees of Angus District Council.<br><br>
We have had a wide-ranging debate. The hon. Member for Paisley, South (Mr. McMaster) invited me to make a speech in my capacity as spokesman on health. You will be relieved to know, Sir James, that that would be completely out of order and I do not propose to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does we Minister intend to respond positively to my earlier suggestion?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am about to respond to the hon. Gentleman's suggestion. It is for him to decide whether that is positive. First let me say that the criticism of the hon. Member for Fife, Central that the Government have not taken the issue seriously is completely unfounded and I repudiate it. The hon. Gentleman obviously did not listen to the beginning to my speech. He was probably arranging his tie at the right angle for the television cameras.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tarn Dalyell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was asking about what can be succinctly described as the Pat Fawcett problem, which my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian raised. It is the serious problem of a part-time worker who is an excellent councillor.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a serious point and asks a straightforward question. The identity of the employer is the key consideration. That is not altered by the full-time or part-time status of the employee. The hon. Member for East Lothian referred to a social worker. If she works in a part of Lothian region that will not be in East Lothian, she could be a councillor. However, if that is not the case, she will be ineligible to stand for election to the new unitary authority.<br><br>
I am the first to concede that the tie of the hon. Member for Fife, Central is better suited to television than mine. He alleged that the Government did not take the matter that we are discussing seriously. The Government set up a joint working group of elected councillors and officials, and the Scottish Office, to examine the problem. We then issued the internal management consultation paper, on which we received many responses. I could read out the total number of responses, but I shall not do that because I am sure that Opposition Members, who have such an interest in the problem, have the figures. The issue is not party political. It is clear that a great majority of authorities were in favour of the status quo. Other authorities took a different view. However, there was no concensus for a compromise.<br><br>
I acknowledge that the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley was trying to be positive and helpful. But the problem is not that people have not considered the issue; many people have examined it. No one has presented a satisfactory answer other than the Government's. If the Opposition present a new proposal between now and Report, the Government will consider it. The hon. Gentleman's ingenuity is widely respected in the House. However, the matter has been considered time and again.<br><br>
The Montgomery committee stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"It has always been a feature of the law on elections in local government that no employee is permitted to stand for election to his employing authority."</p></blockquote>
That is a fundamental principle. The Montgomery committee also examined the possibility of retaining disqualification only for some categories of employees. The hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) made that point. The committee said:
<br><blockquote><p>"These arguments all attempt to chip away at what remains an intracticable problem—conflict of interest. It is essential for acceptance of local democracy not only to avoid conflicts of interest but for it to be publicly evident that the potential for such conflicts is not allowed to exist. We agree with the conclusions consistently arrived at by previous enquiries, which have gone into the arguments with great thoroughness,"</p></blockquote>
including Wheatley, of course,
<br><blockquote><p>"and decided against allowing council employees to stand for election."</p></blockquote>
Without denying the right of Opposition Members to put forward a new scheme if one occurs to them, that seems to be the fundamental principle. It is commonsense, reasonable advice, so I cannot accept the Opposition amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We accept that there is a problem to be solved. We take up the Minister's challenge. If we can,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 468</span>
with the elected authorities and the relevant trade unions, come up with ideas that would take the matter forward, I think that the Minister is willing at least to consider them before Report. I should hope for a meeting with the Minister for that purpose.</span></p>
<p>I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 134, in page 3, fine 46, leave out from "may" to end of fine 4 on page 4.<br><br>
The amendment is an important one, affecting an important feature of the Bill, which, it appears, would give the Secretary of State rather sinister powers in relation to the postponement of elections. Those powers could be exercised without a proper debate in Parliament. Had they been available already, there is little doubt that they would have been used to abolish the regional elections this year. That was not possible and, rightly and properly, the elections will go ahead—and will be a referendum on the Government's conduct of local government in Scotland. The result will, I believe be a body-blow to the Government's morale and an electoral wipe-out.<br><br>
I ask the Minister to bear it in mind that the Secretary of State appears to be taking on a power that did not previously exist—and should not now exist—in law. At the least, if it is not to be withdrawn, Parliament should have the right to debate such a draconian power for the Secretary of State before any election is simply lifted out of the electoral calendar. I hope that the Minister will give us assurances about the Government's motives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Labour candidates in the regional elections will be interested to know that their personal record of service to their electors will not be an issue in the elections, which will be entirely a referendum on wholly unrelated matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I say frankly that the Secretary of State need have no fears. The Labour party in Scotland will sweep the board on both counts—service and general quality.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My ears may have deceived me, but I thought that the hon. Gentleman referred to me as the Secretary of State—<i>[Interruption.]</i><br><br>
The hon. Member for Hamilton made a serious point. I reassure him that there is nothing sinister in this provision. He referred to the possibility, which does not exist under the present legislation, of deferring the regional elections. It was a suggestion in the public prints, issued by the hon. Member for Fife, Central for discussion. He was then jumped on from the most enormous height by councillor Charles Gray, the president of COSLA—<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman remembers it well, but I do not know whether the greetings were necessarily fraternal on that occasion.<br><br>

9.15 pm<br><br>
The power is already available in England and Wales. Perhaps I may describe the kind of circumstance in which it was necessary and has been used in England and Wales. That was in 1986, when the date for ordinary local elections would otherwise have fallen during the Jewish Passover—the date of the local elections was moved.<br><br>
A decision to change the date must be made at least 15 months before the normal date of election. That means that no Government could decide on a whim to alter an election date. Moreover, the new date of election could not be postponed indefinitely; it must be in the same year.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hamilton also said that, technically, the Bill's provisions are not subject to any parliamentary procedure. That is a perfectly reasonable point to make. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we shall revise the Bill to make it clear that, if the Secretary of State were to exercise this power, it would be subject to a parliamentary procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a helpful suggestion. However, will the Minister accept that the affirmative procedure would be better than the negative procedure? It would be helpful if any order produced under the Bill, when enacted, required scrutiny by the House of Commons. The negative procedure would involve prayers, and so on; there is some difficulty about guaranteeing them. There is temporarily a difficulty about having some orders debated, except on the Floor of the House. I agree with the Minister that there should be scrutiny. However, if there is a choice, he should adopt the affirmative, not the negative procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I am sure the hon. Gentleman will accept, I cannot give that precise assurance tonight. There are some difficulties in getting affirmative orders through at the moment, too.<br><br>
If an order is subject to the negative resolution procedure, without question if the official Opposition or a large number of hon. Members wish to have a debate, a debate is granted. I shall consider that point. However, the concession that I make is not as detailed as that; the concession is that any such order would be subject to a parliamentary procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the light of this remarkable conversion by the Minister, and also bearing in mind the remarks of the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, with which I entirely agree, I am willing at this stage not to press the matter.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 470</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As there are no amendments to the clause and it would perhaps not otherwise be debated, perhaps I may confirm that it is largely a technical clause. It gives effect to schedule 2, which makes provision for the establishment of the new authorities, including detailed electoral arrangements and arrangements for the first meetings of the new councils. Its provisions do not apply to the councils for the three islands areas, in recognition of the continuation in office of the councils for these areas from the elections in 1994 until the second ordinary elections in 1999.<br><br>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW LOCAL AUTHORITIES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 119, in page 118, line 7, leave out from "Act" to end of line 8 and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"consultations with local authorities and electors of that area; and the Secretary of State shall lay before Parliament a report of such consultations.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment refers to the first elections for councillors, so it is important. The wording of the Bill bothers me. Paragraph 1(1) of the schedule states that the Secretary of State makes directions.
<br><blockquote><p>"after carrying out…such consultations as he considers appropriate."</p></blockquote>
Those words worry me because the Bill hands many powers to the Secretary of State to make powers and orders without normal parliamentary scrutiny. Too much power is given to the Executive at the expense of Parliament and too much secondary legislation of all types is sluicing through the House. The schedule merely adds to the Secretary of State's regulation and order-making powers.<br><br>
The amendment is designed to discover the Government's intentions. It would force consultations and would clarify who should be consulted. The Secretary of State should consult local authorities, electors and even Parliament so that whatever he decides receives some scrutiny. The amendment would make the Secretary of State more answerable for his decisions instead of allowing him yet more powers to take those decisions by himself of with whomever he chooses.<br><br>
The schedule covers the shape of the new system—in each ward and in each council. They are the building blocks of the electoral system. The Secretary of State should be publicly answerable for his decisions and any consultations should be open to scrutiny.<br><br>
Will the Minister tell us: whom is the Secretary of State consulting, how is he consulting them and when? The Minister must know the answers. If he does not, he must at least have a clear idea of what will happen. I seek answers so that we know how the Minister intends to proceed. The Secretary of State should not have the power to hold consultations "as he considers appropriate". The Committee has a right to know what will happen.<br><br>
The Bill gives many powers directly to the Executive. Will the Minister tell us with whom, when and how he

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 471</span>
intends to consult on the very building blocks of the new electoral system?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened with considerable sympathy to the hon. Gentleman. He is right to move what I hope I am right in describing as a probing amendment. The hon. Gentleman wants proper consultation on the issues he has mentioned.<br><br>
The Secretary of State's power under the schedule is limited in scope. The areas that he will determine are essentially for the purposes of the first shadow elections. As is clearly provided for in the schedule, the intention is that the initial boundaries should be thoroughly reviewed by the Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland before subsequent elections take place. The boundaries that the Secretary of State will determine are, therefore, essentially a stopgap. He is given the power initially to determine these areas simply because time would not allow an exercise of the scale normally conducted by the boundary commission. Whether the Bill receives Royal Assent in July or later—I do not want to stir up Opposition Members by making a forecast—the time available for making the necessary preparations for the shadow elections is very limited and demands a streamlined arrangement for determining the new boundaries.<br><br>
Turning to consultation, paragraph 1 of schedule 2 already requires the Secretary of State to carry out consultation and I can assure the Committee that such consultation will undoubtedly include all local authorities and also COSLA which, incidentally, would be excluded under the terms of the amendment.<br><br>
I do not believe that a statutory consultation with local electors as proposed in the amendment is feasible or practicable. In most cases the new electoral areas will emerge from the existing review of district wards. In cases where it is proposed to depart from the district ward approach, the Government have already given an undertaking, in paragraph 2.4 of their White Paper, that:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State will consult first with the existing local authorities for the area concerned and publish his proposals for public comment before using his proposed powers to define a new electoral area".</p></blockquote>
Finally, as I have said, the initial electoral areas will be subject to a full review by the Local Government Boundary Commission as soon as possible after 1 April 1996—a process which will, of course, as always, go through the entire process of consultation, publication of draft proposals and so on. That process will be familiar to the hon. Member for Angus, East. I hope that that explanation of the consultative process helps him and other members of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Minister's courtesy in his answer. He has been quite forthcoming but alarm bells still ring in the back of my head. I still believe that the Government are taking more executive powers. They can carry out any such consultation as they consider appropriate. I was worried by the Minister's remark that
<br><blockquote><p>"time would not allow an exercise of the scale normally conducted by the Boundary Commission."</p></blockquote>
But it should be an exercise of that scale and it should be undertaken in much more detail and with much more consultation. The fact that time does not allow for it is simply another example of the rushed nature of the Bill.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 472</span>
If we are running out of time, it is because the Government are hammering the Bill through as fast as they can to meet their timescale for the elections, instead of having the commission as requested and instead of having thought through boundaries and proper public consultation. The time constraint shows the rushed nature of the Bill. It is a fundamental flaw in everything that has happened regarding the Bill.<br><br>
There has been no mention of Parliament—I want the maximum consultation on these matters. The Government say they are happy to hear public comment but we have had that already. They rushed to ask the public what they thought and then most of their views were ignored, such as on water boards, for example. I am not terribly satisfied by the Minister's response. It only illustrates once again the rushed nature of this ill-thought-out reform. I would much rather the Government waited to get these and other matters correct so that once the reorganisation was introduced and implemented it would work and last.<br><br>
Although the Minister has been very courteous in his answer, I still have grave misgivings about the rushed nature of the Bill. I remain dissatisfied with the answer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman started off by saying that the answer was pretty good. He became more negative as he continued.<br><br>
It is not appropriate for me to respond the hon. Gentleman's more general points. I reiterate our commitment: the Secretary of State will consult the existing local authorities and then publish his proposals for public comment before he uses the proposed powers. The whole panoply of the Local Government Boundary Commission will then be effected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister not grasp that there will be a rush job to create new local authority wards or electoral divisions, and that people will be elected to shadow councils in 14 months? Those wards may subsequently disappear in the review that the Minister has just described. How much more confusion does the Minister want to create for the electorate and the long-suffering councillors? That is not a serious or sensible way in which to legislate for local government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I answer the hon. Gentleman with a simple point: the timetable is exactly the same as it was in 1973, when local government was previously reformed. The Opposition have constantly commended that timetable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In 1973, there was a consensus, which followed 12 years of discussion. I appreciate that local authorities will be consulted and that public comment will be permitted, but Parliament and the electorate will not be involved. The electorate is in the front line and will have to live with the consequences. I am dissatisfied with the way in which powers are being swept through and given to the Executive.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is very difficult to collect the votes if hon. Members talk during a Division. I would appreciate it if hon. Members remained silent for that brief period.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 135, in page 118, line 8, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) For the purposes of the direction required by paragraph 1(1) above the number of councillors should be no less than 1680.".</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the numbers of representatives elected the new councils—<i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, I forgot to say "Unlock". I thought that we all wanted to remain here until tomorrow morning!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is fairly normal for the doors to be locked when I am speaking.<br><br>
The amendment does not propsose that the numbers of the new councils should simply be the sum of the existing regional and district councillors in each council area. We recognise that seats must be redistributed to ensure equitable and fair representation on councils throughout Scotland. The Local Government Boundary Commission must recommend the number of councillors in each new council.<br><br>
The amendment deals with the anxiety about the potential reduction in the overall number of councillors in Scotland. At present there are 1,601 councillors—445 regional councillors and 1,156 district councillors. The Government intend the new council areas to be based on district council wards. I hope that the Minister makes clear the Government's intentions for the new electoral units. Will they be based on existing district council wards? If so, that would, at a stroke, cut by more than a quarter the number of councillors in Scotland.<br><br>
Conservative Members may say, "So what?" but that would mean that Scotland, which has already a lower ratio of elected councillors per head of population than any other country in the United Kingdom or, indeed, in western Europe, would be pushed even further down the European league for councillors per head of population. COSLA has distributed the brief on the amendment to all members of the Committee. Its figures show that at present, on average, one councillor represents 2,220 people in England and one councillor represents 1,350
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 474</span>
people in Wales. In Scotland, however, one councillor represents 3,080 people, which is significantly more than in England, Wales and the other countries of western Europe. That position will become worse under the proposals.<br><br>
From earlier debates it is clear that the Government are prepared to debar about 7 per cent. of the adult population of Scotland from serving on councils. From the fact that we are discussing the matter at all, we know that they are prepared to write off the views of the majority of people in Scotland who believe that the Bill is not just unnecessary and wasteful of public money, but unwanted by almost every section of Scottish public opinion. The Government now seem happy to wipe out at a stroke more than 400 councillors. That shows a disgraceful attitude to democracy in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roger Knapman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stroud)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman repeat the figures that he gave? Do they come from district councils, or are they adjusted for the present two-tier system? How are they arrived at?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The figures are arrived at by taking an average across metropolitan districts, London boroughs, shire counties and shire districts and, taking the number of councillors elected and the population in those areas, the average is one councillor per 2,220 people in England. Doing the same exercise for Scotland, the average is one councillor per 3,080 people. That is higher than the figure for England and considerably higher than the equivalent figure for Wales. Scotland has far fewer councillors than in other any part of the United Kingdom. That is a fact. It is a fact also that the Government intend to make that worse by taking away more than a quarter of existing councillors as a result of their local government reforms.<br><br>
It was not so long ago that the Conservative party in Scotland could command the support of more than 50 per cent. of Scottish people who voted in general elections. It was not so long ago that the Conservative party could win councils throughout Scotland, securing big Conservative majorities. When I first entered local government there was a considerable Conservative majority on Tayside region: it was the jewel in the Tory crown. They have lost that, however.<br><br>
Conservative Members should reflect on what is happening to them in Scotland because of their attitude to democracy in Scotland. They are reduced to a poor third and often a poor fourth in opinion polls in Scotland. Even worse, they are reduced to vying with a party of Trotskyist revolution to form the official opposition on Glasgow district council. Councillor John Young, the leader of the four-strong Conservative group there is in danger of being replaced as leader of the opposition by Councillor Tommy Sheridan, a Marxist. At a local government conference held recently in Scotland for Tory party members, which I know the Minister attended, Councillor Young pointed out that as a result of the Bill, there are likely to be 7,400 members of unelected quangos in Scotland, yet the number of elected councillors in Scotland will be reduced to just 1,200. He called that a disgrace, and it is a disgrace—Conservative Members had better realise that. They can do something about it by giving the amendment serious consideration. I have not heard the Minister speak yet, but so far he has given no indication that he is prepared to accept that this is an unjust situation which desperately needs improvement.<br><br>

We know that the number of councillors on each council is ultimately based on recommendations made by the Local Government Boundary Commissions for England, Scotland and Wales. The commission for England has established bands for council size to which, by and large, councils tend to adhere. Metropolitan districts have between 50 and 80 councillors, London boroughs have between 50 and 70, shire counties have between 60 and 100, and shire districts have between 30 and 60. I am not suggesting that we in Scotland should ape what they do in England—in fact, I would probably be the last person in this Committee to say that—but councils tend to be larger in England because of the English commission's recommendations. There are more councillors per head of population. Scotland has smaller councils, with fewer councillors per head of population. That is not satisfactory for Scottish democracy. If we are serious about improving local government democracy, we will have to do something about a state of affairs that leaves Scotland with fewer elected councillors than any other part of the United Kingdom.<br><br>
The COSLA document is very long, so I shall not go through it in detail as we want to make progress. I shall just refer to some of the points in it. The Redcliffe Maud commission and the Wheatley report drew attention to the management problems of over-large councils with too many councillors. They recommend a maximum of 75 members on each council. Under the Government's proposal, Highland council would have about 90 members while, at the other extreme, Stirling would have only 20 members. Having huge councils with many councillors, and small councils with only a few is not a balanced approach considering that the Government are aiming to have unitary, all-purpose authorities, which are meant to be of a similar size, throughout Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take it from the hon. Gentleman's remarks that he will be supporting the proposals of the Association of Highland District Councils for two authorities in the Highlands.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will have to wait until we reach that amendment before he finds out what I will be supporting.<br><br>
I understand the argument that smaller councils lead to increased efficiency. That argument is included in the COSLA submission on the amendment. The Audit Commission for England and Wales made a fairly radical proposal. It said that from a management point of view, it would like councils to have a membership of no more than 18 or 20 councillors, because that would lead to greatly increased efficiency in the council's delivery of sevices and general functioning.<br><br>
If we wanted to be super efficient, we would do away with elected councillors and take the Mussolini road. We would make the trains run on time by just telling people. Hitler built the Autobahns, after all, and put Germany back to work. But there is a price to be paid for that kind of efficiency—the crushing of democracy. I hope that Conservative Members realise we cannot crush democracy and that they should not even think of trying to crush democracy in the name of efficiency or anything else. If the Bill completes its passage unamended, and we do not tackle the problem of the number of elected
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 476</span>
councillors in Scotland, the big loser will be democracy in Scotland.<br><br>
It was argued in a previous debate that these proposals will mean that the opportunity for people to participate in local council elections and to stand for election will be greatly reduced. That will be a particular disadvantage to groups that are already unrepresented on councils and in Parliament, such as women and people from ethnic minorities. Such groups find it difficult to break through into Parliament Anybody who refutes that should look around the Room—not a single woman or representative of an ethnic minority is a member of this Committee. They are grossly under-represented both here and in councils. If we reduce the number of councillors, we are reducing the opportunity for such people to break through.<br><br>
9.45 pm<br><br>
There is an urgent need to review the problem of under-representation of councillors in Scotland. Until we get that review, no action should be taken that pre-empts the outcome of the review by reducing the number of councillors. That would happen if the Bill was passed, unamended. We must ensure that there is a review and that the number of councillors in Scotland is not reduced before that review takes place. The only practical way of ensuring that is to support the amendment. I hope that Conservative Members who are genuinely concerned about local democracy in Scotland will listen to the arguments and vote accordingly, even if the Minister is not prepared to accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to refer briefly to a couple of points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion). A balance must be struck between ensuring that councils are not too big and that the wards are not too big. The role of a councillor is partly involved with the supervising of the management of services and ensuring that things are working properly in the council as a whole.<br><br>
Also, a councillor has an immensely important role as an ombudsman, taking up individual cases and looking after the complaints of individual constituents. If that service is to be a decent one, there must be limit on the size of wards. I was a councillor in Strathclyde, with an electorate of about 17,000. I had two district councillors working with me, each taking half of my ward. Those wards were composed of about 8,500 people. That is too large for a single district council to cope with. If we reduce the number of councillors in the Strathclyde area, that will lead to disillusionment about local government. Individual councillors will not be able to cope with the scale of problems that they face, given the size of the electorate.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will be prepared to recognise that we require an adequate number of councillors, not only to advise the central services, but to provide the person-to-person contact, which is such an important part of local government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan made a sensible speech, to which I shall respond in a moment. I did not think that the reference of the hon. Member for Dundee, East to the fact that there are no
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0268">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 477</span>
female members of the Committee was the strongest point of the evening. It is fairly well known that, under the original proposals for a larger Committee, the hon. Member for Paisley, North (Mrs. Adams) was to be part of the Labour team. She was the one who got knocked off as a result of the process of consultation—to put it at its best.<br><br>
We are debating a serious subject. The hon. Member for Dundee, East referred to the position in England. He is not on terribly strong ground there, either. The first proposals for a single-tier authority in England were, as hon. Members know, for the Isle of Wight. The Local Government Commission for England proposed 48 councillors for the Isle of Wight. That contrasts with the current figure of about 100.<br><br>
We have considered the matter carefully. It was considered in the context of the review of the internal management of local authorities in Scotland. Hon. Members will not be surprised to know that we received a range of views from local authorities and others about councillor numbers. There was no clear message on the question of actual numbers. The emphasis understandably tended to be slanted towards the need for the number of councillors in a particular area to reflect population, geography and other local factors. I believe that that is right; I do not believe in a slide rule approach to the number of councillors in an authority. Council size at present varies from 10 in Nairn to 66 in the City of Glasgow.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dundee, East was right to refer to Wheatley. What Wheatley said remains valid. The Wheatley Commission said:
<br><blockquote><p>"it is often argued"—</p></blockquote>
on the grounds of efficiency—
<br><blockquote><p>"that the membership of governing bodies should be kept to a minimum. Large councils … are said to result in inefficiency. We think that this depends to some extent on the way in which an authority organises itself internally and handles its business. But in any case that is not the whole picture.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>The representative side of a councillor's work presents another aspect. The smaller the constituency, the easier it is for the councillor to keep in touch with his constituents, and vice versa."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Govan also made the point about the variety of a council's role.<br><br>
The difficulty, said Wheatley, lies in deciding what is necessary because so much depends on the circumstances of each authority. That is a sensible approach. We are proposing that the normal rule for drawing up the new electable areas should be based on the district wards that are currently being reviewed by the commission. We have made it clear that we would depart from that general principle only when necessary to remove anomalies or to reflect local circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister focus his mind on the Borders council area? Does he mean that every district will get the number of councillors anticipated in the management consultative report? That would lead to a large number of Borders councillors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we should consider splitting the Borders to deal with the problem raised by the hon. Gentleman. My point is that the general principle of one councillor per existing district ward may, because of local circumstances, result in a council that was, by general
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 478</span>
agreement, too large. The Secretary of State could depart from that general principle after consultation and assurances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has suggested that councils could, by general consent, be too large. What size of council would be too large? He said that the Government did not have a slide rule approach, so presumably he has no upper limit in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is correct. The amendment is wrong to give a minimum limit for the number of councillors, nor would it be correct to give a maximum number. The number of councillors must reflect local circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Knapman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister is right that there should not be a maximum or a minimum. Could he speculate where, in those areas of England that will have a unitary authority, councillors will be representing a similar number of constituents as councillors in areas of Scotland that will have a unitary authority?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To enter into such speculation might be dangerous. My hon. Friend raises an interesting point, but I shall confine myself to the Scottish situation.<br><br>
On the point raised by the hon Member for Govan, it is worth bearing it in mind that Wheatley recommended a limit of 75, even for the largest authority. We are not committed to that limit; I am merely pointing it out to the hon. Gentleman. There is no absolute rule on the matter.<br><br>
I do not dispute that this is an important topic. Everyone who has considered this matter objectively believes that a range of factors must be taken into account. They were straightforwardly spelt out by the hon. Menbers for Dundee, East and for Govan. We must have the right number of councillors to enable elected members properly to perform their role on committees, and to perform their back-bench and constituency roles without making councils unwieldy. It is not sensible to set a figure in statute.<br><br>
I hope that I have clearly set out the Government's proposals, and that Opposition Members, on reflection, will not feel it necessary to press the amendment to a Division. I accept that they have made a number of reasonable points in the debate, which the Committee necessarily had to have. However, if the amendment is pushed to a Division, I advise my hon. Friends to vote against it.</span></p>
