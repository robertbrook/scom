	<p>".—(1) It shall be the duty of a local authority in administering property held by it as part of the common good to ensure that where a community council or councils exist for the whole or for a major part of the area in which such assets or property are held—

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may benefit the Committee to spend a few moments on the important question of common good funds and how the Bill provides for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a good innings on most of the essential questions arising from the Bill. Although there may be opportunities to do so on Report and in the House of Lords, we have not spent much time examining how community councils relate to the new reorganised structure. Evidence from my constituency and elsewhere, and especially from rural Scotland, suggests that the community councils feel that they have been somewhat bypassed. I understand that the 1973 provisions are not weakened or diminished. However, there is a view, with which I have some sympathy, that the Committee has missed an opportunity to consider what further powers and extensions of responsibility—even extending powers to spend penny rates, or alignment with whatever the current provisions are for parish councils in England—could be given to community councils in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2026</span>
Scotland. In the consultations before the Bill was presented it would have been appropriate to consider the advisory role that community councils have played and will play. But I suspect that to do so at this stage would, technically, be out of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to focus on community councils as vehicles to reassure local communities, especially in rural Scotland. The provisions to husband resources, heritable property and the assets of the common good funds. Those have existed in Scotland for many years, and should properly be devoted to the purposes for which they were originally bequeathed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As members of the Committee know, common good funds have existed for years—in some cases for hundreds of years. They have been well looked after and well used by local communities, especially in rural Scotland, for the benefit of the people. In 1973, concern was expressed and there were debates in the House about the potential loss of control over those assets as the 1973 reorganisation created bigger units. For example, the funds that were bequeathed for the Hawick common good—formerly in the control of the Royal Borough of Hawick—moved to the control of the district authority. In Roxburgh, the district council had its headquarters in Hawick. Therefore, control did not move geographically, but it changed in that it went into the hands of the district council that covered the whole of Roxburgh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other examples, of which St. Andrews is one. My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Campbell) has corresponded with the Minister, expressing concern. In 1973, the control of the common good funds moved from St. Andrews to Cupar. That caused some anxiety at the time and there were discussions about it during the 1973 proceedings. After the present reorganisation, in north-east Fife—if the proposed boundaries for Fife remain extant—control of the St. Andrews common good fund will go not just from St. Andrews to Cupar, but from Cupar to Glenrothes, Falkirk or goodness knows where.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I impute no conspiratorial motives to the Government; I am perfectly satisfied that Ministers are doing their best. However, in those circumstances, people who are responsible for common good funds in their localities are worried that there are no guarantees that those funds will be ring-fenced for the communities for which they were designed in the first place. That merits attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is my best stab at providing the necessary reassurance and protection. I appreciate that it is not watertight and that it may be technically deficient. The Minister may say that it is impossible to provide the legislative framework to get the guarantees for which I am asking because that would be fiendishly difficult. The nature of community councils, the way in which they are constituted and the limits and constraints on their powers and responsibilities make it difficult to hand common good assets to them. They are more transient than are some statutory local authorities and they do not have the legal capacity to hold heritable property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is anxiety in south-east Scotland, in St. Andrews and in the Highlands and Islands where the new regime of unitary local authorities that the Bill creates will be much further removed from the localities that the common good funds were originally designed to serve. I am sure that the Minister will concede that those funds are a crucial part of local communities. The Hawick common
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1119">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2027</span>
good fund, for example, contributes substantially to supporting the Hawick common riding, which is an important local festival. The funds are a valuable resource which have been under the control of local people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fears have been expressed to me, with which I sympathise, that if the Government are not careful and not alive to the danger that control may leak away to locations far removed from the areas that the common good funds were designed to serve, there will be much anxiety and anger in the communities covered by common good funds in future. If the Minister can provide some reassurance for the people who control and are worried about common good funds in Scotland, the new clause will have served a purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the arguments of the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) and particularly to his point about Cupar and St. Andrews because I was born in St. Andrews and brought up in Cupar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman suggested, there are some technical problems with the new clause. I do not criticise him for that, but it would restrict the flexibility of the new authorities and there could be problems when community councils do not exist. However, I accept the spirit of the hon. Gentleman's proposal. I cannot accept the new clause, but I can assure the hon. Gentleman that in our guidance to the new authorities on their relations with community councils, we shall include the need for them to take full account of his points about the administration of common good funds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is all that I could have expected this morning. It is a useful reassurance. In addition, I hope that the Minister will make sure that officials scrutinise and monitor the future use of the new councils' assets to ensure that there is no geographical leakage outwith the areas for which the funds were designed. However, the Minister has given a useful reassurance, and on that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion, and clause, by leave withdrawn.</i></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>New clause 40</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>AGREEMENTS IN RESPECT OF TRUNK ROADS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<br><blockquote><p>".—The Secretary of State shall in carrying out functions as trunk road authority, enter into agreements with local authorities to act as his agents to carry out those functions relating to maintenance, repair and improvement together with any other dealing relating to a trunk road.".—	<i>[Mr. McLeish.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As part of local government reorganisation in Scotland, the Government intend to transfer certain principal roads to the trunk road network.

authorities be precluded from carrying out winter maintenance work on the new trunk and motorway network? Secondly, does the agreement intend 100 per cent, competition for highway work, including winter maintenance, after local government reorganisation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If 100 per cent, competition for highway work, including winter maintenance, is introduced and local authorities are precluded from tendering for work on the trunk road and motorway network, that will drastically reduce the size of Scotland's roads direct labour organisations and threaten the jobs of 5,000 staff who are directly employed and others who are indirectly employed. I would appreciate answers to my questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Local authorities will not be precluded from tendering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the new clause, the future management and operation of the road network will be the key to ensuring that we get the best possible service out of our infrastructure in future. Our approach will be deliberately and carefully designed to ensure that we are able to make the most effective use of valuable resources—including skilled personnel—and harness the full range of skills in the public and private sectors. I am glad to note that such a partnership approach is also the policy of the Labour party, as can be read in its recent document "Financing Infrastructure Investment". I commend that document to the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions in the Bill are a fully satisfactory basis for doing that. They provide a basis to ensure best value for money and also cover the concerns in relation to staff and the staff commission, to which we shall come on new clause 41. I, therefore, resist the new clause and ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still not clear on the matter of 100 per cent, competition for highway work, including winter maintenance. Is that to be the policy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that local authorities are not precluded from bidding in that process, nor should they be. We want the best value for money. If a direct labour organisation or a local authority wins, that will be fine provided that value for money is obtained for those who live in the area. We want the best possible arrangements to be put in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that hundreds of jobs were at risk, but I do not accept that. Those who work in local authorities which are agents for trunk roads in Scotland are highly skilled and the arrangements work well. There will be considerable continuity. However, if a large proportion of the roads become trunk roads—up to 650 miles of roads could be trunked and some roads may be detrunked—there will be a shift. The best value-for-money arrangements will be put in place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still not clear. Does the agreement intend to introduce 100 per cent, competition?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have said, competition will certainly be designed to ensure best value for money and my understanding is that local authorities will not be precluded. That answer stands. If that is inadequate in any respect, I shall write to the hon. Gentleman and to the members of the Committee.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new unitary authorities will experience many problems. The new clause would ensure that an environmental, economic and social assessment—a position statement—could be made to ascertain how the new councils discharge their functions and tackle problems. The new clause emphasises that we still believe that the Bill and the reorganisation are crazy and unnecessary. If the councils are established, the tremendous social and economic problems of Scotland in the last decade of the 20th century will constitute a real test for them. We have no faith in the councils' ability to deliver a system of local government that will deal with problems in Scotland. The new clause puts up a marker for the need for a review after the new system has been established. However, we remain optimistic that elections will not take place next year because the Bill and the timetable are a mess. We shall campaign for a review when our proceedings end.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make two comments, Mr. Martin, before you rule me out of order. First, I have not exactly been known to favour a nationalist point of view, but I understand the exasperation of a large number of people in Scotland who foresee the wanton destruction of local government. It angers even me, and I am pretty equable on these matters, to learn what has happened over the last stages of this Bill. I do not say that people should behave in the way that some do, because I believe in parliamentary manners and parliamentary rules. The staff of the House who showed them to the door behaved with maximum courtesy and gentleness. The way that they coped was to their credit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second comment is that I am not a great one for attacking the press but I get depressed and sad—Mr. Linklater and Mr. Kemp please note—that as soon as anything like this happens, the press, having come here in numbers we have not seen for many moons in this Committee, immediately leave rather than concentrating on reporting to Scotland any of the content of our

proceedings. Put-up jobs are all very well, but I am depressed by that.

I should like to ask two questions about new clause 46 which I frankly admit comes from the Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland. It asks how it will be possible to finance services presently carried out regionally by regional archaeologists, conservation officers and countryside rangers. Secondly, will the strategic issues, such as the need to ensure that the putting in place of requirements for water and sewage treatment, waste disposal and mineral extraction, be handled effectively without the strategic overview? I should like to home in on the question of the archaeologists with whom I have had a great deal to do in the last year, particularly in relation to Cairnpapple hill, which Historic Scotland rightly says is the most important bronze age site on the Scottish mainland although not as important as those on Orkney and Shetland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I refer the Committee to the letters sent by Dr Bill Hanson to the Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro), on 17 March. The Council for Scottish Archaeology, along with other bodies, has stressed that responsibility for the protection of archaeological sites should have a local as well as a national dimension. Over the years, those persuasive arguments have borne fruit, and the great majority of regional councils in Scotland have appointed one or more archaeologists to their staff. I have upheld the virtues of Lothian region on many occasions in this Committee. I may well be told by the Minister that Lothian region does not have an archaeologist, to which my reply would have to be, "Touche".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities are fearful that unless the bodies that replace them are obliged to take on archaeological responsibilities, an important provision for the protection of our national heritage will be lost at local level. The smaller local government units may not consider themselves large enough to support archaeological services unless they are obliged to do so.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2032</span>
At the annual general meeting of the Council for Scottish Archaeology, reassurance was sought from the Secretary of State that adequate archaeological provision would be made at local authority level in the proposed reform of local government, and by statutory obligation. It was further argued that it is in the interests of the Scottish Office to ensure that local authorities undertake the task of ensuring the mitigation of threats against archaeological sites and developments. If they fail to do so, the burden of responsibility will fall instead on Historic Scotland, whose staff are already hard pressed. I know that Dr. David Breeze and his colleagues are indeed hard pressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because I am under curfew, I should like a reply from the Minister on these matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) said, this is a probing new clause. I am sure that in practice the Opposition would not want to place a statutory obligation of this nature on the new authorities. Nevertheless, it has enabled us to have an important and useful debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any good council will, of course, take into account the effect of its policies on the social, economic and environmental well-being of its electorate. I support the idea that such considerations should be fully and adequately transmitted to the electorate in its area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) raised an important point. The Under-Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries and I have listened carefully to the representations to which the hon. Gentleman referred. It is up to the individual authorities how they manage their responsibilities in relation to archaeological sites. At present, some authorities appoint archaeologists, while others do not. Under the new structure, authorities will have a range of options. They can provide archaeologists themselves, enter into agreements with other authorities or obtain expertise from other sources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, I can assure the hon. Gentleman that my hon. Friend and I will read his detailed points with great care and will, if appropriate, be in touch with him and with those who have made representations to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I hope that the Government have some sympathy for the point made in the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new clause refers to an issue that the Committee considered earlier. It would vest a statutory responsibility for electoral registration in the assessors of the new authorities. In practice the assessors are now the electoral registration officers, for traditional and extremely good reasons. I think that hon. Members would agree that that function, which is important to them, is extremely well carried out, but present statutory provisions allow authorities flexibility as to who should carry out the electoral registration function. I do not think that we should want to prescribe the local authorities' power of decision in this way. We anticipate that the assessors would continue, in practice, as electoral registration officers, but we should not wish to impose a new restriction on local authorities in that regard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that anything is to be gained by discussing the matter further.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware of the precise answer to the question. I will make inquiries.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like some clarification, Mr. Martin. I do not think that a debate on the matter is needed, but the new clause is an important one. Is it in order to make some comments, or should the matter be dealt with formally by a vote?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may speak now and put his case, after which we may proceed formally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to rehearse the debate that we conducted about town planning and structure plans, but the new clause is important. My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow and I referred to the issue when we discussed amendments. The relevant legislation has been very successful and considerable concern is still felt in Scotland about any change to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 51 is moved with the best of intentions, and it should not divide the Committee on political lines. We are concerned about the tremendous potential for chaos in the establishment of the new system, should certain authorities wish to be difficult, especially in relation to the possible conflict between local planning and the structure planning systems that have served Scotland well in the past few years. I ask the Minister to recall earlier debates on this subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1123">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2035</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned about the position of the Scottish House-Builders Association, which is anxious about strategic planning. The association represents interests on land and planning matters. The Scottish Building Employers Federation is the employers' federation for the building industry in Scotland. It is recognised both by trade unions and by Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to the previous consultation paper, "The Structure of Local Government in Scotland—Shaping the New Councils", which was published in 1991, it was recognised that most consumers of local authority services considered that the existing two-tier structure had not yielded the levels of efficiency that had been anticipated by the Wheatley commission. Many of the comments from the housebuilders repeat previously expressed views which the passage of time has not changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The housebuilders consider that the primary role of local government should be the efficient delivery of services in the most cost-beneficial manner, with clear accountability. They call for a system of planning, and state that there is real anxiety about the loss of valuable strategic planning in a unitary structure. For example, there could be a danger that unitary authorities could be responsible for assessing both the demand and land supply for housebuilding. Similar difficulties could arise from the zoning of land for commercial and industrial purposes. It would be a retrograde step to lose the benefits that have been derived from regional structure plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ideally, unitary authorities should be large enough to sustain effective structure planning and also be co-ordinated with plans for infrastructure services. Roads and transportations, together with water and sewerage are certainly prime candidates for the integration process. As the question of water and sewerage is the subject of separate negotiations, it should be treated separately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The building employees federation and the housebuilders' association both doubt that few, if any, unitary authorities could meet such criteria. They strongly recommend joint boards or committees to provide the strategic planning which is considered absolutely essential. It is also recommended that industry should have substantial representation with voting rights on such joint boards or committees. That would have the effect of achieving a greater degree of partnership between the public and private sectors and allow the views of industry and commerce to be taken on board at the outset. As the housebuilders' associations recognised by the Scottish Office for consultative purposes on structure and local plans, significant representation on such joint boards or committees would be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Have the Government considered that point, which raises certain matters of principle? Whether it is right or wrong, the point of view is serious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that the Scottish Office would consider issuing planning guidance prior to the preparation of structure plans. Such guidance could set minimum housing land requirements to be met in each unitary authority and the housebuilders would wish to be involved in the formative stages of preparing such guidance. When the guidance is finalised the figures should be subject to testing and there should be recourse to some ultimate control should a unitary authority attempt to ignore strategic planning guidance given. The testing process is essential to ensure that current land supply and any proposed land releases
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2036</span>
were effective in terms of availability, viability, marketability and free of physical restraints.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The housebuilders already have considerable experience of working with existing local authorities in most of their existing functions. The building employers have similar extensive experience in dealing with various other agencies. Therefore, in making this submission, they feel qualified to offer comment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You have been very patient, Mr. Martin, so I shall leave it at that, except to say that such a serious commentary on matters of strategic planning deserves attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Minister that, in a debate earlier in our proceedings, he assured me that the structure planning process would be one of the most important factors—if not the most important factor—to be taken into account in any planning appeals which may be referred to the Secretary of State. I was pleased to receive that assurance in view of the environmental impact of certain planning applications before the local planning authority in the Grangemouth area open to the chemical industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister tell us why, if he is to rebut the new clause, it is not necessary to have something better than voluntary local structure planning? That is all that is in the Bill as drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can reassure the hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Structure plans, as I emphasised earlier, will continue. Final responsibility is with the Secretary of State at present. That will continue because he must approve all structure plans. The present statutory requirements to prepare a structure plan will remain in place. There will be a duty upon those authorities whose areas are included in the designated structure plan areas to prepare structure plans either singly or jointly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is sensible to be flexible in giving local authorities the right to consider the circumstances in different parts of Scotland against the background that the Government will take a strategic view when prescribing structure plan areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Linlithgow expressed the views of housebuilders. His hon. Friends would not necessarily agree with the concept that the members of the new joint boards should include industrialists as of right. I appreciate, however, that he was making representations on behalf of an important and involved group of people. I may reassure him by saying that we shall formally consult the existing authorities as well as the new authorities before the Secretary of State takes decisions on the new structure plans. The housebuilders' important point of view will be considered, although their representations are often not in line with those from other interested parties. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we shall consult the housebuilders in the process of consultations with the local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the Minister's view on the joint boards in this context? What is his response to the Scottish Society of Directors of Planning? I shall not go into the entire argument advanced by its secretary, Alan Whyte,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1124">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2037</span>
as time is short, but the matter is not merely one of briefing documents. I have had discussions with all sorts of people who think that the housebuilders' views are important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What discussions have taken place, and are likely in future, with the Scottish Society of Directors of Planning? Alan Whyte puts its point of view thus:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Let us suppose the problem facing a joint Board is where to locate a major new national portrait gallery for Scotland. Do you think that a joint Board of Councillors elected primarily to represent the interests of the citizens of Glasgow or Edinburgh could settle the matter efficiently?</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>That is a hypothetical case but I will quote you another nearer home. The City of Aberdeen, although relatively small, is experiencing the sort of traffic strangulation which seems to afflict all great Cities these days. Investment in new road works is urgently required and the appropriate level for establishing the nature of this investment would be at Structure Plan level. Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire will have to co-operate in the formulation of such a Structure Plan. The representatives of the citizens of Aberdeen will want to see expenditure directed at the problems of their electors such as works to improve the ebb and flow of traffic into and out of the City, traffic calming, investment in parking and a host of other measures within the City boundary. The people of the rural area however will give their elected representatives for Aberdeenshire quite different problems, especially those who dwell in the North."</p></blockquote>
All that I ask at this stage—without vexing my colleagues on the Committee—is that, before the Bill goes to the House of Lords, the Government will have yet another discussion with the Scottish Society of Directors of Planning. A solution must be hammered out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that regular discussions with the Scottish Society of Directors of Planning will continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So we can safely say that, in the light of our debate and before the Bill goes to the House of Lords, the Government will have another serious meeting?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall simply repeat what I have already said. I would not want to make a commitment on details of the date of any specific meeting, but we have regular discussions with the Scottish Society of Directors of Planning.

We have received from the Scottish arts lobby a submission on this matter in which it says clearly that a clause is essential if the good practice of the best of the present district regional councils is to be inherited and developed by the new councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important for the Government to realise that there is something special in Scotland about the way in which the arts have developed in partnership with local authorities—not local authorities necessarily trying to take over, because many of them realise that it is not always appropriate for local government officers to carry out arts functions. Local authorities have stuck to developing the important library function, which has become a fundamental part of the education as well as the leisure system in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Steeple in King street in Stirling is one of the first subscription libraries in Scotland for which people have to pay a small fee. We have moved on from that and local authorities have developed libraries that have not only books but many other types of material. Even the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Knapman) and hon. Members from other parts of England who are present know about the Edinburgh festival. How many of them know about Mayfest, which is at least as important in the cultural calendar of Scotland, and is run by the Mayfest committee in the west of Scotland? The Jazzfest is assisted by local authorities, especially Glasgow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have received from the Citizens theatre—one of the longest running theatres in Scotland, again in Glasgow—a list of the contributions by many local authorities, from
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2040</span>
Strathclyde, which contributed £199,500 in 1992–93, to Cunninghame, East Kilbride, Kyle and Carrick and Motherwell. In central Scotland, the McRobert Trust funded a theatre in the new university of Stirling, which I attended in 1967. I had the honour of being the president of the students and the honorary president of the university—the equivalent of the rector—and I serve at the moment on the council of the university. That university has been helped by funding from local authorities in central Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again and again in Scotland, we find this relationship between local authorities and the arts. As a fan of a great hero of the blues, James Brown, I was amazed when he, who had never appeared in Britain, was at the Aberdeen R and B festival—that is rhythm and blues festival for hon. Members who do not follow that type of music. The festival showed initiative and wrote to many R and B agents in America and was told that Mr. James Brown was available on that Saturday if he could fly an entourage of 24 with him across to Aberdeen. He did so and people travelled from all over Britain to go to that show. That shows the initiative and imagination that come from having people in the arts looking after the arts and local authorities providing funding so that those people develop their own ideas about what the public might want to see.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the hon. Gentleman's support for the blues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing inappropriate in that; Falkirk also play in blue. Not all teams that play in blue play in Glasgow. There are many aspects including free art galleries. I do not mind paying a fiver for special exhibitions such as Picasso at the Tate as I did last week for that wonderful exhibition of his work, or an extra pound at the Burrell in Glasgow to see the Degas sculptures. Many people have spent a pleasant day there. The great thing about the Burrell is that it is free, not just because of the Burrell bequest but because of the local authorities' contribution to the Burrell art gallery in Pollokpark in Glasgow. We do not wish to damage the creative and imaginative quality of life that comes from that relationship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also Scottish Opera. I was once at the Council of European Municipalities and Regions conference in Glasgow and many Italians from their local authorities were present. They were invited to various events and chose to go to Scottish Opera. I also went, and the Italians were amazed at the quality of Scottish Opera's performances; they had not imagined that the northern part of Europe had such a high quality company. They gave it a 10-minute standing ovation. That has come about because, again, Strathclyde and Glasgow combined with arts providers, the Scottish National Orchestra, and others. Those are the open, creative quality additional corollaries of the special relationship that new clause 55 attempts to preserve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Libraries in Scotland have a built-in relationship with the people in towns. The mobile library service provides access to books and other media for people in rural areas. It operates in the north of Stirling, which I know well, and, no doubt, in all parts of Scotland. People assume
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1126">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2041</span>
that there will always be a freely available library service because local authorities provide it on the principle that the service is paid for through local and general taxation, so it is provided free with no barriers, simply because many people do not have the money to pay for using it. The Library Association has lobbied hard, and should be complimented. I hope that the Minister and his colleagues will take on board the principle of new clause 55 and promise that the arts and libraries provision and the Scottish art galleries will not be damaged by the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse all that my hon. Friend says and, as might be expected, wish to put a little Ayrshire spin on it. The James Brown whom I know is not the rhythm and blues man. Incidentally, the blues on the Conservative side have very little rhythm about them. The James Brown whom I know is a predecessor of mine—a former Member of Parliament for South Ayrshire, who became the Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. He came from Annbank, a small mining village near Auchincruive, where my hon. Friends the Members for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) and for Paisley, South (Mr. McMaster) studied, and is commemorated by James Brown avenue in the town.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As well as the Edinburgh festival and the Mayfest, there are the Ayrshire arts festivals. Similar festivals are held throughout Scotland. In addition to the main musical activities that my hon. Friend mentioned, the Girvan jazz festival is well known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend mentioned the Citizens theatre. A great friend, Marianne Bell, has for some time been a member of the board of that theatre, for which I have great respect. Ayr has the Borderline theatre, which does a tremendous amount of work for theatre in Ayrshire. I am genuinely worried about them. My only disagreement with the tenor of the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East is that he was a little too kind and generous to the Government. That is most unusual for him. It must be demob fever!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps there was a lift in my tone of voice because we are coming to the end of the Committee. I was encouraging the Government to accept my argument rather than supporting them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we are all in benevolent mood—rather like prisoners coming to the end of their sentence and looking forward to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know who will reply to the debate; I assume that it will be the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Dumfries. We have a genuine worry. Let us consider, for example, Borderline, which receives a generous grant from Strathclyde, as does the Citizens Theatre. Strathclyde, which has a huge budget, can make grants to those organisations. Each district council, if it considers that a theatre is doing a good job for it, may give additional grants. So Borderline and the Citizens theatre receive regional grants as well as supplementary grants from each district. My fear is that when unitary authorities come into being, each authority will give a sum similar to what the districts gave before them, so that the income of many such organisations will decrease substantially. I hope that the Minister will think seriously about that and about our amendment, although I doubt whether the Bill will go
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2042</span>
through because I think that the other place will do the right thing for us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The demonstration that took place earlier was pathetic, very theatrical. Perhaps the young people who came into the Committee should learn something. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Davidson) and I know what happened. We beat a chap called Sillars. He, too, was a great actor, most of the time a great presentational performer on the platform. He has ended up as assistant to the secretary general of the Arab-British chamber of commerce. How the mighty have fallen! Let that be a lesson to those youngsters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon McMaster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend spoke of the young people who came into the Room. If he was referring to the demonstrators I feel gratified, because not only did I serve on the council with Councillor Bruce McFee I was also at school with him. I recall that when he played hide and seek no one would look for him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I doubt whether I can top that. I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I notice that even the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) enjoyed that wee joke. It ought to get on record: I hope that it gets back to Renfrew and that he sees it. As both the hon. Gentleman and I have celebrated our 50th birthday, they were youngsters by comparison, as is my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South—a young, active and positive member of the Committee, as well as being Labour Whip, of course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not deviate further otherwise my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow will give me another row. There is great concern that while under the present two-tier system, there are two pots to which these vital arts organisation can go for money, in future, with one tier, they will have only one pot. I hope that the Minister will give the Committee a positive note of encouragement when he replies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My remarks relate to the future of these organisations after reorganisation. Like my hon. Friends, I am especially concerned about funding for the organisations and facilities that are based in cities which now receive financial contributions from surrounding suburbs by way of grants from regional councils. It is unfair and unreasonable to expect the cities to carry the burden of institutions such as the Burrell gallery and events such as Mayfest, which contribute to the arts in areas much wider than simply their own boundaries. That is yet another example of how the suburbs will be freeloading on the backs of the council tax payers in cities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, the cities will have an obligation to keep going galleries such as the Burrell and events such as Mayfest. However, is not it unfair that the suburban areas should make no contribution? At least under the regional councils there was a uniform levy and so there was a contribution from the regions to cover such matters. I am worried that Cumbernauld theatre, for example, which has substantial grants from Strathclyde, may not be viable if it is supported only by the district council. That theatre draws on a much wider area than just the town of Cumbernauld. If it has to rely on contributions from the district, it may collapse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1127">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2043</span>
I shall be interested to hear how the Government intend to deal with that. Some form of two-tier system may yet again be required to ensure adequate financial support for our arts organisations and facilities, such as Cumbernauld theatre, the Burrell, Mayfest and the whole range of facilities of which we are so proud in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear that I am not benevolent and cannot raise a spark of humour about this dreadful Bill. However, I want to ask questions on matters that concern the Scottish arts lobby, SALVO.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, will the new councils, amalgamating both good and bad arts practice from former components, sustain their staff, policies and funding of the arts?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, how will the crucial regional council funding for the Citizen's theatre, for example—my hon. Friends have raised this matter—be replaced? Will the smaller councils that follow accept the same funding responsibility as has Strathclyde? The same question could be asked with regard to Lothian.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, how will national and regional opera and ballet companies and galleries be assured of contributions from the new councils? Eric Robinson and his colleagues deserve answers to those questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second set of concerns that I wish to raise are those of Scottish Natural Heritage. It suggests that local authorities should be given a duty to report on the effectiveness of the discharge of their natural heritage functions, both before and after reorganisation. The new authorities should also be given a statutory responsibility to promote sustainable development in the conduct of their own activities and in exercising their powers of regulation and control as well as a duty to produce annual reports of their performance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be an onus on the relevant existing and future local authorities to discuss and agree proposals for securing the future of the many recreational resources, including long distance routes and regional and country parks, which local authorities manage at present, often with support from SNH. The new authorities should be given a statutory responsibility to provide facilities for countryside recreation. They should be given a duty to make adequate provision for a network of paths for informal countryside recreation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish local authorities' responsibilities for maintaining rights of way should be put on the same footing as those in the rest of the United Kingdom. There should be a statutory requirement to consult SNH when there is an intention or proposal to sell water authority land or to export water out of Scotland. There should be a duty on the new water authorities to promote access to and recreational use of the land under their custodianship and to make the continued provision of such access a condition of the sale of any of their land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities are partners with SNH in the provision and management of some of the most important recreational resources in Scotland. It is especially important that they should be able to resource and manage the facilities that will span the boundary of more than one local authority. The continued ability to designate regional parks when regions no longer exist as an administrative structure is another important consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2044</span>
The Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Dumfries, will recollect that, some months ago, I wrote to him about the Pentland park. He replied that all would be taken care of in the course of the Bill. Well, like many other things, all has not been taken care of during the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local government reorganisation offers some opportunity to put the provision of recreational and leisure facilities on a stronger and more consistent basis throughout Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

I spoke to Magnus Magnusson who is extremely worried, as are his colleagues, about what might happen. Even at this late stage, I wonder whether I may ask for a Government comment, if it is forthcoming.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Sir Hector Monro)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an important little debate and I am glad that the hon. Member for Falkirk, East introduced it. I shall try to reply to the matters that were raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Libraries are a district council function, except in Dumfries and Galloway, the Borders and the Highlands, where they are a regional function, strongly attached to the education authority. It is, incidentally, interesting for me that the Public Libraries Consolidation (Scotland) Act 1887, on which the United Kingdom free library system is based, was taken through the House by my great uncle, William Ewart, who was the then Member for Parliament for Dumfries Burghs. That is why we have the library in Dumfries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He was a liberal, was he?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, a good liberal—before the family saw the light.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sport, recreation, museums and the arts are district council responsibilities; as I have said, the regional councils are frequently involved because of the relationship between those services and education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subject to parliamentary procedures, in the future all those responsibilities will belong to the single-tier authorities. That is highlighted in paragraphs 3.28 and 3.29 of the White paper
	<br><blockquote><p>"Shaping the future—The New Councils"</p></blockquote>
which prefaced the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The firm promise by the Government was fulfilled by amendments Nos. 777 and 842, which are now included in the Bill. Those provisions formally transfer the existing powers of the old authorities to the new authorities. Also—this is important—amendment No. 777 provides a new power so that the new authorities can support and help to finance cultural and other activities outside their own geographical boundaries. Therefore, authorities anywhere in Scotland could give financial support, if they wish to do so, to Scottish Opera or the Edinburgh festival for example. That is an important addition to the new authorities' powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The phrase "if they wish to do so" is precisely the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me cite an example off the top of my head. The city of Edinburgh holds a large number of cultural events
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1128">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2045</span>
that are supported by Lothian region. As long as Lothian region exists, my constituents have no hesitation in supporting those arts activities. But what will happen when the local authority is divided up and there is a West Lothian unitary district council? I can understand that, at the very first drop of the proverbial hat, people in Whitburn, Armadale or Linlithgow may wonder what on earth they are doing paying money out to Edinburgh. I beg the Minister to believe that it is not as simple as he may think. As long as Strathclyde and Lothian existed, people outside the city—I am a transalpine Gaul—were willing to pay. Once the authorities are divided up, it will be a different matter in terms of public acquiescence to payment for the arts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is aware that the revenue support grant distribution takes account of arts and tourism relative to the cities for the very reason that he mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have spent a great deal of time during many sittings—this is particularly true of Opposition Members—highlighting the responsibilities of the local councils and of the local councillors. I have a great deal more faith than Opposition Members perhaps have that the councillors in Scotland representing the new authorities will ensure that there is a great benefit to the nation gained by supporting the international aspect of art such as festivals and theatres, which were mentioned by Opposition Members, that are outwith the territorial region of a particular council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have the highest regard for the Scottish arts lobby, SALVO, and am pleased that it raised those important issues. I suggested at a conference that I attended that amendments would be brought in to ensure that local authorities have the power to support the arts, recreation and sport in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 842, which deals with the other new clause, was a technical amendment to the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. We had discussions with the Scottish Library Association and Mr. Robert Craig. He is happy that the issue has been dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that the 1887 Act has so much foresight that it covers the provision of information even under modern technology that was not thought of at that time. It covers absolutely the information issue that is raised by the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments that the Government said that they would table to respond to the information given in the White Paper relative to the arts, sports, recreation and museums have been introduced. I have every confidence that the new authorities will fulfil their duties adequately and progressively. All those amenities, which mean so much to improving the quality of life in Scotland, are important. There is no reason why they should not be enhanced in the years ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have brought in amendments to fulfil the wishes of the Opposition, as expressed in the new clause. The amendments have been discussed and accepted, so the Opposition might consider withdrawing the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

the Minister a bottle of the best whisky that there will be all sorts of complaints that local authorities have not paid for anything over their boundaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As soon as there is a financial difficulty, it is in the nature of councillors to concentrate on that which concerns them directly inside their borders.

When my hon. Friends the Members for Fife, Central, for Paisley, South and I were councillors, we did not hear warm words from the Government, but heard that we were all profligate. The very creativity that has developed the arts in Scotland often came from the initiatives that were then used by the Conservatives at local level and often by the Government to cite overspending and throwing money away. Thank goodness the Labour authorities stuck to their guns and their principles, and developed the kind of services that we currently have.

It is very difficult now to persuade district authorities to join in when something takes place in another district area. It is usually the initiative of the regions—I cited the example of the Citizens theatre—that draws in the districts. With individual authorities, it will be much more difficult. Although the Minister says that that problem is already dealt with in the Bill, it is a pity that he did not take a little more notice of the message that we have been putting over, and realised that there are serious reservations that he should share if he really cares for the arts and the libraries. We will not, however, press the matter to a Division, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I make the plea, perhaps for the last time, that if this crazy reorganisation goes ahead, the Government must acknowledge that there will be major difficulties with regard to the voluntary sector, because of the fragmentation of the strategic coverage of the regions.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to debate the important issues of family services and children this morning, because the Committee has already debated the importance of social work and the reporter service. I hope that we shall return to those issues on Report. I also suspect that they will receive detailed consideration in another place. I merely want a response from the Minister on the new clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can reply briefly. New clause 65 would place on local authorities a duty to provide adequate resources for particular services. Local authorities are already under a clear duty to provide for social welfare under the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 and they have powers to provide a range of services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are problems of definition with new clause 65, but we have much sympathy for the need to develop and improve children's services. That is why an extra £10 million in grant-aided expenditure has been made available this year. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will recognise that the new clause is not appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a good deal of sympathy for new clause 72. The intention to introduce strategic planning was set out in the White Paper "Scotland's Children", but we think it important to devise the new system carefully, taking account of plannning work done by local authorities. We prefer to work out the detailed scheme with local authorities and other interested parties and, then, introduce a formal requirement in subsequent children's legislation, in which the necessary provision would appropriately lie. Given the reassurance that we will develop a system of child care planning in collaboration with local authorities, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the new clause 72.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have great admiration for the work done by the adult basic education team, which often links up with deprived children. The work is carried out by people such as Mary Ballantyne in West Lothian and Sarah Kilbey in Edinburgh. They have developed advanced techniques of teaching lip reading. How will such specialist teams be protected by smaller authorities? I do not pretend that many teams are involved, but a small number of my most disadvantaged constituents would be greatly deprived if such specialist teams were to break up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At an official level, I hope that representatives of the Scottish Office will have discussions with Mrs. Kilbey
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2050</span>
and others about the work that they do and how it can be protected in the new set-up. I am not getting at the Scottish Office because it has been extremely supportive in the past and people in St. Andrew's house care much about those matters. Discussions should be held on how specialist lip reading services, for example, can be protected. My hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian understands my point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow makes an excellent point about disadvantaged children. I shall withdraw the new clauses, but we hope to see a children Bill introduced in the House at the earliest possible opportunity. That should involve all the parties so that we ensure that provision for children into the next century is the very best that Europe can provide. I hope that the substance and spirit of the new clauses and my hon. Friend's comments will be taken on board and that our request for a children Bill will be taken seriously by the Minister. The issue is vital. It was picked up in our debates on the reporter service, on social work and on other issues involving the single-tier authorities.

	<p>(2) The membership of any joint committee established under subsection (1) shall be composed of at least one member for each of the authorities belonging to it.</p>
	<p>(3) Each new authority shall not later than 1 November 1995 publish a statement indicating, as the case may be, that it is proposed that a single joint committee should be established or that the council proposes to belong to a specified joint committee.</p>
	<p>(4) The Secretary of State shall before 1 February 1996 consider whether the proposals published under subsection (3) are satisfactory, having regard in particular to the desirability of ensuring as far as practicable that the trading standards functions will be discharged in Scotland in an effective manner which, in particular
	<ol>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be brief because the issues are clear-cut. The new clause would prevent the problems that the fragmentation

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2051</span>
of the trading standards service will cause in the move from 12 to the more than 30 regional authorities that the Government propose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is widespread fear that the trading standards services, which are important for policing and maintaining industrial standards, will be threatened by fragmentation. The Confederation of British Industry, the British Retail Consortium, the National Federation of Consumer Groups and the police north and south of the border, have expressed worries about the fragmentation of a valuable service, which creates the level playing field on which consumers and producers depend to conduct their business and to trade and buy fairly. I hope that fears about fragmentation will be allayed by the Government's response to the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new clause refers to joint committees, which are voluntary bodies. The Bill contains nothing to prevent local authorities from establishing such joint arrangements. However, the hon. Member for Hamilton raises an important point. I have met Sir Gordon Borrie and representatives of the Institute of Trading Standards Administration to discuss those matters. The hon. Gentleman referred to other representations that we have received. We concluded that local authorities should retain the right to decide how to deliver their own trading standards services. Current experience suggests that a wide range of councils deliver those services satisfactorily. That includes sharing specialist advice when necessary. The voluntary joint committees to which the clause refers can be set up under the Bill. However, I accept that the hon. Gentleman made an important point. I am prepared to meet Sir Gordon and his colleagues later if that is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Costs</i></p>
	<p>21.The Agency may recover such costs as they determine are necessary from local authorities within Scotland and such other bodies as make use of the service to defray the cost of providing the service.".</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill contains no proposals for the important services that regional councils in Scotland currently provide in appointing public analysts and financing their laboratory services. What proposals are the Government considering for providing that service after reorganisation? The service is currently provided by four regional councils: Strathclyde, Lothian, Tayside and Grampian. The other regional councils and the Island councils have made arrangements to use the services on a fee-paying basis. The public analyst services are mainly used by the district and Island councils, especially in enforcing the Food Safety Act 1990.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The public analyst laboratories also provide agricultural analyst services, analytical and scientific advisory services to regional councils' trading standards departments in enforcing Trade Descriptions Acts and Consumer Protection Acts, drinking water and water pollution analysis, air and land pollution analysis and scientific advisory work for the district council, and an emergency call-out service to the police and fire brigade, especially during chemical emergencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am particularly anxious about the representations from Strathclyde's regional chemist's department. It is located on two sites, one in Glasgow and one in Cumnock in Ayrshire, as my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2054</span>
Cumnock and Doon Valley knows. The large Glasgow laboratory is a refurbished school building, which was completed in March 1992 at a cost of more than £4 million; it stands in its own grounds. The smaller Cumnock laboratory has been located for many years within the grounds of a sewage purification works. There are approximately 120 staff with 110 in Glasgow. The total annual cost is approximately £4,300,000. The Cumnock laboratory provides an analytical service—mainly water analysis and air pollution work—for the Strathclyde region department of sewerage and the district councils in the south of Strathclyde.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Glasgow laboratory provides a wide-ranging service: an analytical service for Strathclyde region department of sewerage; the public analyst service for all the district councils in Strathclyde central region, Dumfries and Galloway and the Western Isles; the agricultural analyst service for Strathclyde region and Western Isles council; environmental analysis, air, water and ground contamination for district councils and a radioactivity monitoring service for the regions of Strathclyde, Dumfries and Galloway and Tayside, and the constituent districts in addition to Western Isles council. It also carries out analysis of consumer goods for consumer and trading standards departments of the regional councils and a scientific advice service. Both are related to the interpretation of data provided by the laboratory, the interpretation of data provided by others and commentary on public information. It also provides a microbiological service—mainly food and water examination—for all regional and district council departments which require the service. Specially trained technical staff and fire brigade personnel form the technical support unit which provides specialist advice during chemical incidents at fires and elsewhere and the servicing and calibration of gas monitors for use in sewers in confined spaces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Together, the two laboratories povide all the analytical services for the department of sewerage in addition to their other functions. The department is designed and run as an integrated whole, with a central administrative section, and that is the point: it is a highly integrated operation in every area. The department has recently undergone the National Measurement Accreditation Service quality assessment and it anticipates a formal award of NAMAS accreditation for much of the work. The quality system is designed for the department as a whole—splitting the functions would necessitate putting a new quality system in place. That would take a minimum of a year to accomplish and would entail considerable additional expense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is proposed is the splitting of a service that works extremely well and that is a serious matter. In Strathclyde region, all analytical services for the department of sewerage are provided by the independent regional chemist's department. That department, as an integrated facility, also provides the public analyst and agricultural analyst service to almost half the existing Scottish local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have four questions. First, what provision will there be to ensure that essential analytical facilities are available to the west of Scotland water authority? What provisions will be made to ensure unrestricted access to scientific services by the new Scottish local authorities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On my famous sojourn at the East Calder sewage works, the same questions were asked. The provision of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1133">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2055</span>
analytical services by an independent laboratory ensures that scientific staffare not prejudiced in their advice based on analytical data.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, how will the continued independence of the analysis of trade effluence—the results of which will be the basis of charges to traders—of sewage works effluents—the results of which will prove the satisfactory operation of treatment works—and of sludge to be disposed to land and soil after treatment—by which the environmental impact of sludge disposal is minimised—be ensured by the west of Scotland water authority and the successor water authorities in Lothian?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third question relates to the Colston laboratory of the Strathclyde regional chemist's department, which is a new, integrated facility. It is designed to allow economies of scale and to support a wide range of technical expertise. About half the work is undertaken for the department of sewerage. The remainder is undertaken for a total of 34 existing local authorities. The facility cannot, realistically, be divided. Neither Strathclyde water department nor the Strathclyde department of sewerage have any property rights in the Colston laboratory. The building, equipment and staff are retained as a corporate facility by Strathclyde region. Does the Secretary of State intend that staff or property will be transferred to the west of Scotland water authority?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Colston laboratory was financed by borrowing. It attracts loan charges of about £820,000 per annum—about 20 per cent, of the total costs. What provisions will the Secretary of State make for the transfer of the loan charges to new authorities? What proportion, if any, will be charged to the west of Scotland water authority?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, what provisions will be made to meet essential operating costs of the public analyst covering Strathclyde, Lothian, Grampian and Tayside, and of the regional chemists laboratories? The amount involved is estimated at £6 million. At present, there is no mention in the Bill of the provision of public analyst or other scientific services. The four existing laboratories are all owned and staffed by the regional councils. The Bill does not give those services a home. The statutory duties of the laboratories are those of the public analyst under the Food Safety Act 1990, to which the Bill proposes no changes, even though the Act refers to regional and district councils. Clause 168 means that changes to that Act are not strictly necessary, but it would be preferable to alter the Act's references to local authorities. If no changes are made to the Bill the provision of scientific services will be difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a recent parliamentary answer, the new authorities' requirement for a public analyst was recognised, but the Bill contains no appropriate mechanism. It will be left to the new authorities to make such arrangements, after May 1995 but before April 1996, without guidance. That is not a satisfactory way to preserve an important service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two options have been suggested. First, it has been suggested that a Scottish scientific services agency might be formed to run the laboratories. That would preserve the services within the local authorities, protect facilities and staff and ensure that all new authorities could call on the necessary scientific support. Secondly, it has been suggested that statutory joint boards be formed to run the existing service. Such boards could be the proposed fire
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2056</span>
and police boards, or dedicated scientific services boards. All Scottish public analyst laboratories consider that either of the above options could work, but they prefer the first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Food and Drugs (Scotland) Act 1956 has been replaced by the Food Safety Act 1990, but the position of public analysts remains unchanged. Since 1981, there has been further rationalisation. The Strathclyde service has combined a number of smaller laboratories into a large central unit. The four laboratories now provide a service to all local authorities of both tiers in Scotland. In addition, the range of service has widened to include radioactivity monitoring and increasing amounts of microbiological work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 14 February my hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, South (Mr. Donohoe) asked the Secretary of State to set out his intentions for the future of the public analyst, agricultural analyst and regional chemist services under the proposed local government reorganisation. As I am under curfew, I refer hon. Members to the Minister's reply in 	<i>Hansard.</i> I should like a considered comment from the Government on the case that I have made only fleetingly. I am obedient as always to my hon. Friends on the Front Bench who have commanded me to sit down at 12.20 pm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has raised an important issue. Perhaps I can give him the assurance that the Government will continue to promote uniform standards of enforcement throughout the country. The amendment and the new clause propose a unified national service, which would achieve that uniformity in principle, but it would involve imposing an arrangement on local authorities that is not in line with what the Government believe in general terms nor with the general thrust of the opinion put forward by Opposition Members during our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no reason in principle why the four laboratories which serve 65 councils in Scotland should not continue to serve the much smaller number of councils that will be established under the Bill. Can I reassure the hon. Member on his point about transfer: clause 2 provides for the transfer of existing functions to the new councils. That will include the public analysts. The hon.

	<br><blockquote><p>"to empower the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Authority to guarantee certain obligations;".—	<i>[Mr. Stewart.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. The Committee has sat for nearly 177 hours. At one point I thought that we would be interrupted by someone in a waistcoat even brighter than that worn by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) carrying a microphone and shouting in a cockney voice, "180".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been extremely well looked after during those 177 hours. I should like to thank, first the policemen who have guarded us and have, doubtless, learnt a great deal more about Scottish local government than they wanted to; the Clerk and his assistants, who have guided all members of the Committee and who have been responsible for overseeing the progress of 1,126 pages of amendments; and of course, the 	<i>Hansard</i> reporters, who have been most meticulous and have had to deal with some expressions and place names that were probably unusual to them. I thank all the other staff who have looked after us. I cannot, of course, name my own staff, but I should like to thank the civil servants who have worked extremely hard on the Bill. Many changes have been made to it, and commitments have been made, often in response to points made by Opposition Members, for which I am grateful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I particularly want to thank my hon. Friends from Scottish and English constituencies. Last Tuesday they showed their meticulous grasp of the Bill's detail, and their independence, by voting with the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire on the matter of firemasters. The hon. Member for Hamilton has previously raised the question of whether changes to the Bill have been accepted by the Leader of the House and others. I am glad to reassure him that the Cabinet discussed the question of firemasters this morning. I understand that it was the only item on the agenda. There will be a statement on the Floor of the House at 3.30, to the effect that the Government do not propose to overturn the Committee's vote on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I particularly want to thank my hon. Friends the Under-Secretaries of State, the Members for Dumfries and for Edinburgh, West, for sharing the burden—I shall rephrase that—the infinite pleasure of putting forward the Government's case. I thank also my hon. Friend the Whip, who has made the shortest speeches—and the only ones that were universally popular—in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Above all, Mr. Martin, I thank you and Sir James for the way you have chaired this long Committee. You have had to deal with noises off, if I may so put it, as well as noises on and a great many amendments and points of order from both sides of the Committee. Throughout our proceedings, Mr. Martin, you and Sir James have demonstrated your expertise, your sense of humour and, above all, your objectivity, which has been a tribute to the traditions of this honourable and ancient House. For that you have, I know, the real gratitude of all members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2058</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. I should like to associate myself with some of the sentiments advanced—on this occasion—by the Minister for Eastwood. The Bill has been in Committee a long time—longer, in fact, than the Bill on which I had supervisory powers last year. I am beginning to wonder whether I should be participating in demands for a children Bill next year. However, I firmly believe in delegation and devolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, like the Minister, want to thank those who have served us on Committee silently and patiently. Thanks are due to the police officers and doorkeepers who have kept order during our proceedings. I know that we are not allowed to refer to the civil servants, of whom many have come and gone, but, if we were allowed to, we would place on record our deep appreciation for their help, the good humour with which they spoke to all members of the Committee, and the assistance that they have had to give to Ministers in putting through the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 	<i>Hansard</i> reporters have performed a monumental task. They have absorbed, transmitted and tidied up the language and the arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clerk and those who have occasionally stood in for him have acted with their usual professional objectivity. Although after 177 hours we may still be no clearer about the rules of procedure that affect how amendments are tabled and selected, we are closer than we were at the beginning. After perhaps another 15 years in Parliament, I figure that I may be slightly closer to understanding what goes on. The Clerks do an enormously important job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You, Mr. Martin, and Sir James have acted with great tolerance, often under severe provocation. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley will agree with my praise, but provocation has come from all parts of the Committee and, indeed, I tempted fate at the beginning of our proceedings. Frustration has been contained, tolerance has been displayed and we have had moments of good humour. That shows that both you, Mr. Martin, and Sir James have a deep knowledge of the subject under discussion and have perhaps held back from participating, even though you would have liked to contribute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the Minister, I want to thank my hon. Friends. There was a great contest to become a member of the Opposition on the Committee. Some thought that they had won a place. My hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, North (Mrs. Adams) gave up her place when the Committee's majority was reduced to one. She felt that that was a great sacrifice at the time and we all sympathised with her. She has been going around with a smile on her face for several weeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: She is now off to South Africa.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. She is now off to South Africa to celebrate. My hon. Friends have challenged the Government with great ferocity, but their arguments have been measured. I appreciate deeply their efforts. I particularly want to thank my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central who has been the detailed planner of processes and timing. Despite being stretchered off at Wembley yesterday, he has never been stretchered off in

Committee. A signal achievement was his avoidance of the guillotine, which was one of our principal objectives so that we should not risk having Report and Lords amendments guillotined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank also the Whip, my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South who, unlike many Whips, distinguished himself by making some brilliant speeches. He also carried out his job as Whip assiduously and with great distinction. He is a great feature in this House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Exceptionally, because of the nature of the Committee, I want to thank also Susan Stewart, John Harris and Ronnie O'Connor. They have been around for practically all the 177 hours and have given us great help. They have been tested almost to destruction, and I pay tribute to them. I pay tribute also to my researcher, Alasdair McGowen, who was the brains behind the drafting of many amendments. We are indebted to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a contentious Bill for which there is no consensus in Scotland. It is wrong-headed, it will be damaging, it is anti-democratic and it is internally flawed, which means that it will not work. During our 177 hours of discussion, we have dramatically changed public opinion on the matter in Scotland. We have destroyed the Government's timetable and might have to vote differently from usual on the motion. I would particularly like to pay tribute to the way that the Bill has been handled by you, Mr. Martin, and by the staff. We are all grateful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. I want to add my tribute to you and to Sir James. Any Committee proceedings that embrace simultaneously the East Calder sewage works, the birth of the granddaughter of the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) and the dramatic last-minute reprieve of firemasters has to have special qualities such as the firmness, the fairness and the good humour which you and Sir James have demonstrated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also pay tribute to the people who have briefed the Committee, not just the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, although it has taken the burden of that work. It is right and proper that it should. Many other organisations and local authorities have taken the time and trouble to give us a great deal of information to make the Committee a success. That is not to say that the Bill is satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are serious gaps in the Bill and problems are being handed on to others to solve at a later stage. I hope that the Minister will use his good offices to secure three days for Report on the Floor of the House. He has made helpful suggestions and promises to reconsider matters. If he is thinking again, time will be required on Report to do that. He would have the support of every member of the Committee should he try to gain more time on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ministerial team, although they argued bad briefs and a politically flawed case, deserve recognition. No doubt, their British Empire medals will be in the post.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no excuses because as a member of the Committee of Selection I volunteered not just myself, but the hon. Member for Angus, East to serve on the Committee. I have enjoyed the experience—I think that "enjoyed" is the right word—and as a result am more convinced than ever that proceedings for Bills of such a size should in future be timetabled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2060</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. The Committee is in an end-of-term mood in which I cannot happily join. However, I willingly agree with the thanks for the chairmanship, which has at all times been extremely fair, and for the staff. I can never give thanks for the Bill, which I will continue to oppose utterly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. Of course I pay tribute to the skill of both Chairmen and to the staff, and express my gratitude to 	<i>Hansard.</i> However, I cannot find it in me to find a gracious word for what the Government have done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not a "yah boo" politician, but I must say that the Bill is the most ill-thought-out, damaging measure that I have been involved with in 31 years as a Member of the House of Commons. For the rest of this century it will return to haunt those who have put it forward. It is extremely damaging to the people of Scotland and a disgrace to Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The one thing about Scottish Standing Committees is that there is never a dull moment. We have had disruptions from hon. Members, which has meant going to the Floor of the House to have things sorted out, and today there was a disruption emanating from the Public Gallery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On that subject, although I do not normally mention officers by name, I thank the badged messenger, Mr. Sterne. A difficult situation was handled in a swift and humane manner. I also thank the police officer who was in Committee and the other police officers who were involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not normally mention Strangers, but I am impressed by the fact that members of the public have attended every sitting. A great strength of Standing Committees is that the public are entitled to attend them and, outwith the Committee, to speak to and lobby Members. There is nothing wrong with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have noticed that a great many local authority councillors and officials from Scotland are here. I cannot comment on the Bill, but their presence reminds me of the dedication shown by officials and elected members in local government. We should never forget that these men and women do their work on a voluntary basis. They are a credit to their profession and their office. Many of us are better Members of Parliament for having served an apprenticeship in local government. The House is all the better for having Members with local authority backgrounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to thank my colleague, Sir James, who is a very popular Member. This is the first major Standing Committee that he has chaired. I am sure that he will be remembered for that, and that he will be a very popular Chairman of future Committees. He is an excellent person, who is very easy to get on with, and we work well together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also thank the Clerk, Frank Cranmer. Perhaps he can pass on our thanks to Paul Seaward and the other colleagues who stood in for him. Frank has probably spent more hours in the Committee than anyone else, as there is no break for him. Sometimes people wonder how the Chairman and Clerk get through the long hours. We do not listen all the time because now and again we get

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2061</span>
talking, and I have discovered that Frank is a student of the Northumbrian pipes, and is soon to become a student of the Scottish pipes. Perhaps in a few years he will be able to give us a tune on the Scottish pipes. In any event such conversations have kept us sane.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also thank the civil servants who, although they are here to serve the Ministers, have assisted both me and the Clerk now and again in seeing the Bill through its Committee stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last but not least, I should like to thank the 	<i>Hansard</i> reporters, who have a very difficult task. They must listen to Members' speeches over the background noise, dealing with their various accents, and with words that may not be familiar to people outside Scotland. They do an excellent job and have served the Committee well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I very much appreciate the good-natured way in which the Committee has been conducted. I thank every member of the Committee for their assistance in getting through the consideration of this long Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
