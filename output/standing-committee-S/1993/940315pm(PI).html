	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 371 in page 29, line 2, leave out "may" and insert "shall".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to detain the Committee long on this amendment. Again, it is an attempt to find out from the Government whether the joint boards will be comprised solely of elected members. We are concerned about joint boards and joint committees generally. We are often reduced to making the best of a bad job. If this crazy reorganisation of the police services goes ahead we will want an assurance from the Minister that the membership of the boards will not only reflect the unitary authorities contained within them but will be composed entirely of elected councillors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Situations have developed elsewhere where doubt still exists as to what might happen. We are moving towards debate soon on these three super quangos. Elected democracy will be almost destroyed as the Government seek to create quangos that will involve placemen and women appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Member that joint boards will be composed solely of democratically elected members of new councils. There is no provision in the Bill or in the Police (Scotland) Act 1967 for anyone other than councillors to be members of joint police boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This amendment appears to be on points of drafting rather than of policy. The Secretary of State would obviously include necessary provisions in the amalgamation schemes setting up the new combined police areas established under clause 34 and in any future schemes under clause 35.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to see what benefit there could be in adding the requirement which this amendment would provide. Indeed, it would seem in part to involve the Secretary of State being required to include in every one of the amalgamation schemes for new combined police areas under section 21B any provision which could be made in any scheme under section 19. That does not appear to me to be a sensible requirement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may or may not be a sensible requirement but we are firstly concerned that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1146</span>
Secretary of State will take upon himself so many orders in centralising decision making. On the other hand, if these powers are to be taken we would clearly want to have a level playing field on which irrespective of the level of amalgamation, only elected councillors would be involved. With the greatest respect to the Minister, the Opposition do not trust the long-term implications of much of the nonsense that is being put through the Committee and which will eventually go back to the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson) may think that that is unfair, but our knowledge of the Government's subtext on all this is deeply worrying. I accept the Minister's assurance that under the Bill, although possibly not for future amalgamations, elected councillors will comprise the board membership. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 370, in page 29, line 15, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(5(A) Accounts shall be kept of all transactions relating to all funds of every police force and shall be—
	<ol>
	<li>made up in respect of each financial year; and</li>
	<li>audited by a professional accountant who is either an officer of the Commission for Local Authority Accounts or is an approved auditor appointed by said Commission.".</li></ol></p></blockquote>
The amendment is designed to highlight funding and the need to keep proper accounts. The Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 includes in section 96 the requirement for local authorities to prepare accounts and have them audited. That requirement should also be placed on police forces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have arrived at a most astonishing state of affairs. Not only will there be eight police boards and 30 police authorities, but four cities will have to pick up a massive crime tab which they currently are not paying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know if that was the Government's intention, but the Bill is such a cobbled together mess that I am not surprised that at every sitting we discover something daft, divisive or dangerous. That is the Government's responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment gains more force as we listen to the Government. Labour Members thought that the Ministers and their hon. Friends were members of the party of sound money, but they are embarking on a reorganisation of local government and of the police services that is likely to result in more money being spent not on front line activities, but on bureaucracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us imagine that the 30 police authorities want to spend money and have active police forces working through the eight boards. That means nearly 40 bodies will be involved, for the want of one or two councils: the Parliamentary Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) will probably make the number up to 32 unitary councils to have a round number of 40. His hon. Friends may not have great faith in his ability to gerrymander more councils, but I have an abiding faith in his ability to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0637">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1147</span>
The question of accounting is all the more critical because the Bill is a mess. What are the Government going to do about the worries of the public and of taxpayers about good housekeeping, efficiency and effectiveness in the economy? We are used to hearing such words trip off the tongues of Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By tabling the amendment, we hope to discover, first, whether the Government take finance seriously; secondly, whether they will set up machinery to allay the fears of taxpayers; and, thirdly, whether the debates on clauses 34 and 35 will take on a deeper significance because the Bill is such a shambles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Detailed consideration should be given to the accounts of the police forces. Labour Members do not have a morsel of doubt in their minds that the police can handle themselves, are efficient and effective, and spend money wisely, but officers, chief constables and the Police Federation will be worried about how to audit the vast bureaucracy that the Government are trying to force on police authorities in the name of reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the chief constables and all ranks, begin to appreciate the mess that the Government are landing them in they will make an outcry about expenditure that is not going towards tackling law and order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman received correspondence from the Police Federation on that issue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition have regular discussions with all ranks of the service. There is little enthusiasm for a combination of the Sheehy report and the implications of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) may throw out questions—I shall answer him directly. I suspect that police officers of various ranks, including chief constable, will be unaware of two matters that have emerged this morning. First, they will not deal with eight police boards only, but nearly 40 authorities. That will be a nightmare for them. Secondly, they will be dismayed to discover that in cities the cost of crime will escalate while rural areas will pay little towards the overall cost. That issue, not consulation, will occupy the minds of those in Scottish police forces.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the hon. Gentleman says, but he has suggested that the Police Federation would not know about such matters. Surely, he would have drawn that to its attention in the meetings that he has had with its representatives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Forgive me, Sir James, for being unable to hold extensive consultations with the all the ranks in the police service between 1 pm and 4.30 pm today. I warn the Government that we shall have detailed discussions about the implications of what unfolded this morning, because the police, local authorities and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities are unaware of what took place. Those on the Government Benches can jump up and jeer all they wish, but we have made it clear that the Conservative party's commitment to law and order is not worth the paper it is written on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The police will want to know that massive bills will have to be picked up by council tax payers and that that
	<span class='label label-info column'>1148</span>
will hit the police's front-line activities. Those in the police forces in Scotland are active, serious, dedicated people. They do not want to see scarce resources siphoned off to support the gerrymandering of 30 police authorities and eight police boards, under which the cities will be hit hard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk,
East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does it not strike my hon. Friend as ironic that six months ago the prospect was that the Government would abolish some senior ranks such as chief superintendent? At present, a chief superintendent would run a division such as B division in Central region, which covers Falkirk district. That district may end up as a stand-alone police authority, paying higher salaries and containing more higher ranking officers to control it. Earlier, the Government told us that they could save money and streamline the service by getting rid of chief superintendents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. When I heard his comments, I thought of Fife region and that the Government might tell it that it cannot have more uniformed staff, but that it can have more civilian staff. That is no surprise because we know the picture. There will not be more front-line troops or policemen or policewomen on the beat, but we will have more pen pushers. Let us make that clear to the 30 councils that will have a police force and to the eight boards. The proposal is a shambles. There is no other word to describe the mess that the Government and the Minister have got themselves into.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Kyle and Carrick, one of the elements that will form the new Strathclyde board, crime has gone up in 10 years, from 12,000 offences to 20,000. I thought that the hon. Member for Ayr and his colleagues would want front line uniformed personnel to fight that crime, but what we will get is more bureaucrats to ensure that this crazy system works as effectively as possible. In those circumstances, the amendment is significant. I hope that the Minister will deal with it and help us to understand how the system will work in practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I have one purpose: to correct the myths and inaccuracies perpetrated by the hon. Member for Ayr. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The Minister will find out about that shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ayr seems to believe that if one repeats an untruth often enough, people will believe it. He has mentioned Strathclyde and the number of police there. I shall reveal the true position. In 1991–92 and 1992–93, Strathclyde spent a greater proportion of its available budgetary resources on the police service than any other Scottish police authority except Lothian. In 1993–94 the regional council is spending £11 million more on the police service than the Secretary of State allowed for in his allocation of resources to Strathclyde.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To sustain and increase police funding, the regional council is spending £23 million more than last year. If the council had spent what the Secretary of State suggested, far from increasing the numbers of police officers and civilians available for duty, as is being achieved, it would have been required to reduce the numbers by nearly 600.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0638">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1149</span>
Therefore, Strathclyde is spending more money and is employing 600 police officers more than it would have been able to employ if it had stuck to the Secretary of State's guidelines. I hope that that will scotch the myths put round by the hon. Member for Ayr who is, once again, acting in a mischievous and irresponsible way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under the heading of "Police Establishment" in the police report of 1993, the shortfall on approved levels is 195.I rest my case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment deals with funding and with keeping accounts of the money spent on policing. We need a short debate on that because it is unclear how funding the police and accounting for that funding will be carried out under the proposed reforms. As my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) said, the Bill, which is supposed to create single-tier authorities, provides for eight different police forces and 30 plus police authorities to supervise those eight forces. The Minister must explain how that will work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tayside police will be responsible to the three different police authorities of Dundee, of Perth and Kinross and of Angus, whereas at present it is responsible to only one authority. Will it be responsible to those authorities individually or through the joint board? I assume that the chief constable will retain operational control of the police and that he will decide on the policing requirements, the manpower and the equipment for those three areas, but to whom will he present a budget? The Minister must make that clear. Will the Tayside chief constable present a budget to each police authority or to the joint board? Is it for the joint board or for the individual police authorities on the board to approve that budget? We need clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made one thing clear this morning: the costs of policing will be allocated in proportion to each authority in relation to the actual police forces that are deployed in the authority's area. That suggests that Tayside's chief constable will submit a budget which will cover his policing requirements in the Dundee area and that the Dundee authority only will be responsible for meeting the costs of policing in its area. That is a change fom the current position. Policing in Dundee is currently met partly by the Government, through the 51 per cent. grant, and partly by Tayside council tax payers. In future, only Dundee council tax payers will pay for that policing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That suggests that there will be a clear choice in Dundee: either the council tax payers will pay significantly more than they pay at present, or the numbers of police available to maintain law and order in our city will be cut.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask my hon. Friend a question. I cannot use the example of Dundee, but it is interesting to note that in Strathclyde in 1991 there were 516,000 crimes of which 50 per cent. were in Glasgow. Does my hon. Friend think that, under the new set up, Glasgow city will pick up half the bill for the policing of the entire Strathclyde area?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The implication of what the Minister said this morning is that each council police authority will be responsible for meeting the policing costs within its boundaries. Therefore, Glasgow
	<span class='label label-info column'>1150</span>
council will be responsible for funding the level of policing needed to maintain law and order in the city. The same will be true of Dundee. That is a considerable source of anxiety for me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is not hypothetical. The Minister will find in this month's edition of the 	<i>Police Review</i> an article describing the situation in Derbyshire. In that English authority the chief constable and the police committee submitted a budget of £88.4 million to maintain the level of policing in the area. Because of the council's financial restraints, it was unable to meet that budget. It could only vote through a budget for £83.4 million—£5 million less than the amount that the chief constable and the police committee thought necessary. As a result, the number of police and civilian recruits to the police force in Derbyshire are to be frozen, even though crime is rising.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what is happening in England. It will happen in Scotland if the Bill is allowed to become law. The hon. Member for Ayr has lost interest in the debate. He likes to shout about law and order outside the Committee, but when he gets a chance to do something about it in the Committee he sits and says nothing. He is content to vote through Measures that will make law and order much more difficult to implement in the future. I shall watch how the hon. Gentleman votes when the Committee divides on the clauses. It is one thing to talk about backing law and order; it is another to vote for its support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must clarify who is to be responsible for funding policing in the city. Will it be the joint boards? Will their funding come from all the member authorities, or only from that authority that has that level of policing in its council area? If the latter is the case, the people in Scotland's urban areas are in deep trouble. They will face a dilemma: pay more or, if they cannot do that, face the prospect of fewer police and less policing in the very difficult areas within council boundaries. That will be a consquence of the Bill, and Conservative Members should understand it and begin to do something about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the motive for the amendment, but I can assure the Committee that it is not necessary. It is the police authority that is responsible for the income and expenditure of its force. The police force as such is not involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The existing requirements for accounts and auditing of police authorities will not be altered by the Bill. First, section 96 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 requires every local authority to keep accounts relating to all funds of the authority. The same section provides for audit by the commission for local authority accounts. Secondly, the police authority's claims for police specific grant under the Police Grant (Scotland) Order are audited separately by the commission before the amount of police grant payable each year is finally determined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of that explanation I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell the hon. Member for Fife, Central that the present eight forces will remain, and that there will be no additional bureaucracy. The hon. Gentleman described police civilians as pen pushers: they are nothing of the sort. They service cars and maintain computers, undertake scenes of crime examinations, work in forensic science laboratories and staff computers at police stations.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0639">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1151</span>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that police officers should be released from such duties for active patrol work and for being on the beat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) a clear and definite explanation of how police funding will operate. We have announced already that, quite separately from the Bill, we intend to cash limit police grants and remove the Secretary of State's control over the manpower levels on 1 April 1996. I assure the Committee that there will be consultation with police authorities and chief constables on the details of the formula for distributing central Government grants. Joint boards will decide the budget for their police forces and all constituent councils will be represented on the joint boards. The Secretary of State will pay the police a specific grant to the joint boards of 51 per cent. of the boards' expenditure up to a specified level. The boards will be free to spend above that level, if they meet 100 per cent. of the cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Police (Scotland) Act 1967 provides that the amalgamation schemes to establish joint boards must make provision for payment by the constituent councils in such proportion as may be specified in the scheme of the expenditure incurred by the boards. The Act does not specify what arrangements are made for payment by the constituent authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We expect the authorities concerned to agree to the provision of costs for their boards. If they do not agree, the Secretary of State will decide that, if in future arrangements in an amalgamation scheme prove to be unsatisfactory, they could be changed. That has been done for schemes that have existed since 1979 for Lothian and the Borders. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) will be aware that there were complaints about the funding from the board. People thought that there was too much funding. There has been a readjustment accordingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State will formulate the amalgamation scheme for the new joint boards. We shall consult on the details of funding. We hope that the constituent authorities will agree among themselves but if they do not, the Secretary of State will decide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for putting that on the record. It helps the Committee to understand better his proposed scheme. Perhaps he could explain the appeals process. If I understood him correctly, the Secretary of State will retain the right to intervene and to make decisions about the resource allocation and about irreconcilable disputes within the new boards. I hope that those procedures are more explicit and better understood because in the recent dispute between the Borders and Lothian, the appeal machinery seemed to be totally inadequate and the Secretary of State left the board to its own devices. That would be unsatisfactory in this new situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As an Edinburgh and Lothian Member of Parliament, does the Minister see any sense at all in unpicking what he and I know as Lothian Members of Parliament is a very efficient, well-oiled and organised machine—the Lothians and Borders police? Will he unpick it to set up the joint boards? Is it really worth the candle?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1152</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I return to a brief point that I made earlier because it is relevant to what the Minister just said. He said that he very much hoped that the authorities would agree among themselves on what happened on the boards. How can he reconcile that rather democratic sentiment with the situation that will prevail on the new Lothian and Borders police board? More than 50 per cent. of the composition of that police board will come from one of the four authorities, namely the new Edinburgh council. That council will have a bigger population than the councils of the Borders, West Lothian and East and Mid-Lothian put together. Therefore, it will be quite possible for one authority to dictate the budget and everything that happens in that area without any members from the other authorities even bothering to turn up. How that can be described as consensus or agreement I do not know. Will he reflect on that point and respond to it now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek clarification from the Minister about the principle that he will seek to apply in the event of a dispute between individual local authorities on how the income for the police board will be levied. It should be possible for a joint board to agree to levy income according to population, to location of crimes and criminals and to the deployment of the police. In the event of a dispute, the Minister must, if he is to make a decision, have an idea of the criteria on which he will rely. He owes it to the Committee to describe clearly the principles that he believes should be applied in the circumstances. Otherwise, if records must be kept for the recharging of local authorities for costs incurred by police operating in their area, bureacracy will expand considerably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The easiest approach would seem to be by a flat cost per head across a police authority area. However, if any other level is brought into the reckoning, methodology for recharging will be required. I hope that the Minister will explain clearly whether the believes that that recharging will be worth the bureaucracy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask the Minister an exasperating question. What, in the constituency experience that he and I share, makes him, as a human being and a Member of Parliament, think that the legislation is necessary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note, Sir James, that you called me Lord Henry McLeish. You are too kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends are dismayed and frustrated at the lack of response to clear issues that have been put to the Minister. In terms of funding, he said that restrictions on manpower levels will be lifted. That is the good news. The bad news is that provision will be cash limited. Therefore it will be possible to do whatever is thought right, but only by picking up the tab for everything that is spent above the level that the Government will support. That is not a good deal, by any stretch of the imagination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must return to an important point about the distribution of that largesse in the police boards. We now have some even more up-to-date statistics than previously, in the chief constable's report from
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0640">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1153</span>
Strathclyde, which suggests that in Eastwood there were 7,241 crimes and offences. There were 212, 139 in the city of Glasgow. It does not take a financial genius to work out that the residents of Eastwood may be paying very small sums to the board for its police service. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The Minister, the hon. Member for Eastwood, may suggest that that is not a bad thing. However, Glasgow residents will be paying astonishing sums for the policing of their area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even as an element of natural justice the Government's scheme is a disgrace. It will be fraught with problems of bureaucracy and wrangling. The Minister will have to tackle the simple issue of what will happen if Inverclyde or Kyle and Carrick do not particularly like what is going on. They could elect to opt out. If they do, the Secretary of State will step in. What will he do? We will end up with 30 police authorities, eight boards, recalcitrant single tiers that say the scheme is not for them and the Secretary of State becoming involved. What a mess. In replying to the debate the Government have said nothing to ease our fears or clarify the issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want to press the amendment to a vote because it was designed to allow us a debate, but we give notice to the Minister that when we consider amalgamation schemes under clause 35, and on clause stand part, we shall return to the issues on which we have not received answers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like once more to ask the Minister what experience relating to the very efficient Lothian and Borders police in our neighbouring constituencies—a force which I am sure is as helpful to him as to me—makes the measure necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can answer briefly. The hon. Gentleman's questions are based on a false premise. I do not accept the suggestions by the hon. Member for Govan about what will happen to the police force. The force will be left alone and only the joint boards will be reconstituted. The Secretary of State will decide on the method of allocating costs, especially in a dispute. He will consult on the new arrangements, but he will decide if the constituent authorities cannot agree. What matters is the actual costs that arise in each part of the constituent authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was rightly ruled out of order this morning by your co-Chairman, Sir James, when I tried to raise an issue, and that should have given the Minister and his advisers time to bone up on it. In another Committee the Government are introducing provisions to authorise police officers from Scotland to make arrests in England and to appear in English courts, and vice versa. Those provisions are likely to give rise to additional costs, especially to the Lothian and Borders police and the Galloway police. What extra resources will be made available to police authorities involved in that scheme?
	<span class='label label-info column'>1154</span>
I take it that the Minister's silence is his answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dundee, East has raised serious questions about the working of the new system and he has not yet received a satisfactory answer. I would like to pose two straightforward questions to the Minister. The Government have given themselves reserve powers with regard to the joint boards. What criteria will the Government adopt in disputes between the authorities that make up the joint boards? Secondly, who will decide who should serve on the joint boards? Who will decide what proportion of representatives will come from each authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister replies, may I repeat that my co-Chairman this morning ruled the hon. Member for East Lothian out of order. He has now raised the matter again, but strictly speaking matters related to the Criminal Justice Bill are still out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. The clause deals with the reorganisation of police areas and the provision of finance for those areas. Two of them will be lumbered with additional costs because of what is happening somewhere else. While we are dealing with police boards and their finances, we have an obvious opportunity to obtain an explanation of that problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall leave the matter in the Minister's hands, and no doubt he will respond, as he alway does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The trouble is that the Minister almost always does not respond—especially to the very important speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East. My hon. Friend outlined the situation as between Angus and Dundee, and I would not be impertinent enough to comment on that. The same problem arises in West Lothian and Edinburgh. Substitute Angus for West Lothian and Dundee for Edinburgh and we have the same problem as my hon. Friend ably outlined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there are to be splits, why should the people of West Lothian, who will certainly complain about it, be asked to pay for policing for activities that take place uniquely in the city of Edinburgh, such as royal visits?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is especially pertinent in view of the Lothian and Borders police board's domination by representatives from the city of Edinburgh council. Members of the board from the Borders, from East Lothian, Midlothian and West Lothian will be superfluous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We also need an answer to another question. My constituency contains football grounds. Police activities that relate to those football grounds will occur in Glasgow. The police will provide a service that people outside the city will use. Therefore, it is reasonable for the costs to be shared by other local authorities within the catchment area of Strathclyde police. The Minister has not given a straight answer to that point. Will the cost of policing football games be borne only by the local authority in whose area the football ground is located, or by the whole police authority area?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0641">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1155</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall reply to all the points raised. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Davidson) mentioned Ibrox. The cost of police officers inside football grounds falls on the club.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about outside the grounds?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said inside football grounds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. The Minister fails to understand, or deliberately misunderstands my point. I know who bears the cost of police inside football grounds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a matter for the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That responsibility is governed by costs. That key factor will be borne in mind. The Commission for Local Authority Accounts in Scotland is involved in the matter and a full audit will be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is meaningless.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it in order for the Minister to say that costs are "borne in mind"? They are actually disbursed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is definitely not a point for the Chair. If we let the Minister reply without interruption, hon. Members may get the answers that they require.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. Would it be in order for civil servants to answer directly the questions of members of the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been in the House for many years. I was here when a Labour Government were in power. Conservative Members made the same comments when they were in Opposition as Opposition Members do now. We should let the Minister reply in his own way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What matters is the costs that are incurred. They must be properly audited by the police authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to cross-border arrests, the powers in the Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill will help the police to make such arrests with minimum difficulty and cost. Training may give rise to extra costs but savings will accrue from efficient procedures. Most importantly, the provisions will enhance the effectiveness of policing and bringing criminals to justice. They have been widely welcomed and they should assist the constituents of the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to reserve powers and numbers, the criteria will match as far as possible the approach preferred by the boards. It will be up to constituent authorities to determine the representation on the joint boards. That has worked well to date. We shall consult about the membership of joint boards. Each case will be decided on its merit. I cannot comment on the detail of disagreements that might arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1156</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having failed to get a response earlier from the Minister, I should like to ask my question in a different way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman that the Chair cannot allow repetition. I hope that he will not repeat what he has said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I recognise that the cost of policemen utilised within football grounds is charged to the club, I seek clarification about what happens when costs are incurred by using police outside football grounds. Even though they are outside the ground, they are clearly associated with the game. In particular, I refer to traffic arrangements, crowd control and other activities. For example, in the case of Ibrox stadium, are the costs charged simply and solely to Glasgow or will they be charged to Strathclyde as a whole?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asks an interesting question. Has he ever considered the fact that the costs for policing an activity that brings many people to a given area, such as the ski slopes in Glen Shee to which the majority of people travel from the south and my constituency, are borne by the police in that area? The hon. Gentleman must not think that football grounds are alone in having crowd problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of that, but I am also aware that there is not such a problem with ski hooligans as there is with football hooligans. Vast numbers of police are not required every second week at ski events in the constituency of the hon. Member for Tayside, North. Although I recognise that many activities have similar needs, the intensity of police required at football games in Glasgow is unparalleled anywhere else in Strathclyde. In many instances the crowds come from outside Glasgow to attend the games and it is therefore unreasonable for the entire cost to be borne by a Glasgow local authority. I hope that the Minister will provide information on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether to be flattered or dismayed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall please the Minister on Government amendment No. 311; Labour Members are waiting with relish to discuss amendment No. 368, which is the heart of the amalgamation nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1158</span>
Amendments No. 369 and 378 are simple measures. Amendment No. 369 would ensure once again that joint boards comprise elected councillors, which is right in the circumstances. Amendment No. 378 deals with accountability. The worrying aspect of the drift of law and order policy in Scotland is the removal of power from the local level and with it local accountability. We want the Minister to discuss local accountability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The thrust of policing policy in recent years has been to bring the police nearer to the community. That may mean more uniformed officers on the beat or greater sensitivity in neighbourhood policing. There is a great deal to be said for the police being identified with local communities. Accountability remains vital, no matter what crazy system the Government have for funding and for devising policy. We want the Minister to comment on the amendments, but the thrust of our worries relates to amendment No. 368.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 378 refers to effectiveness. Changes made in the Police and Magistrates' Courts Bill will provide for references in the Police (Scotland) Act 1967 to efficiency to be construed as including effectiveness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment refers also to accountability. In considering in future the desirability of changing the combined police areas to be established under the Bill, the Secretary of State would give a high priority to ensuring local accountability. Accountability is one reason why the Bill does not propose changes to the existing police areas. There is no reason to include in it amendment No. 378. I urge that it be withdrawn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 369 appears to deal with a point of drafting rather than of policy. The Secretary of State would obviously include necessary provisions in the amalgamation schemes setting up the new combined police areas established under clause 34 and in any future schemes under clause 35.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Police authorities will continue to be composed of elected councillors. Accordingly, the chairman and vice-chairman could only be elected councillors. Provisions for the boards to appoint their chairman and vice-chairman will continue to be made in the amalgamation schemes as at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the Minister's goodwill in relation to amendment No. 369, which is similar to an earlier amendment. We sincerely hope that it will be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In respect of amendment No. 378, effectiveness and accountability are important. I remind the Minister that as lines of communication between the citizen and the increasingly centralised control of the service become more tenuous, a serious accountability problem will arise. Without going into greater detail, I want to put on record that when there are 30 police authorities, eight boards and large numbers of detailed projects, including local neighbourhood watches, fears about accountability will remain as the new system unfolds.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 387 relates to Parliament having the authority and the right to debate measures that come before it as a consequence of the Bill. The amendment pales into insignificance, however, in relation to amendment No. 368.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amalgamation ideas in clause 35 are profoundly worrying. The Secretary of State is trying to take draconian powers to centralise the control of law and order and police services in Scotland. That is not right; it is unnecessary, unworkable and against the grain of the development of Scottish police services in the past few decades.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our main anxiety is the incremental move towards a national police force. Clause 35, on page 30, gives the right to make any adjustments, rationalisations and amalgamations on a whim. In subsection (3) the Secretary of State may consult only
	<br><blockquote><p>"such police authorities as appear to him to be affected by the scheme; and</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>where any such authority submit objections to the scheme, inform that authority in writing whether he accepts the objections and, if he does not, why he does not."</p></blockquote>
That is a draconian, centralising power. It would allow the Secretary of State to consider the canvass of police structures in Scotland, merely consult authorities and, if he so wishes, dispense with them and implement whatever he wants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not the role of Parliament or of the Committee to give unreasonable powers to any Secretary of State. We drafted the amendment severely to curtail the Secretary of State's powers and, more importantly, to build safeguards into a democratic process to ensure that if the present or a future Secretary of State wants to do anything with the new reorganised structures, he must consult. There must
	<span class='label label-info column'>1160</span>
be no changes without full and effective debate on what is involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our principal anxiety is that these are draconian powers which aim, beyond the year 2000, at a national police force. We cannot accept that objective from any party or Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we believe that an increasingly remote police force will develop as a result of the centralisation of power and responsibility. We have discussed at length the confusion and chaos that will ensue from the proposals. Centralisation is the antithesis of what is happening anywhere in the developed world. Why do the Government have a monopoly on centralisation? Are not this the Government who want to set people free? Do they not want more choice and freedom in organisations such as local authorities? If so, why do they drift towards giving greater powers to the Secretary of State for Scotland? That is the second profound worry for Labour Members, and it should worry Conservative Members too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, with all of this goes the degree of politicisation of our police services. In any democracy there should be a distinction between the Government, who set out a financial framework and legislation, and the police forces and local authorities, which get on with the job at hand. However, there is a real danger that the more the real number of police authorities in Scotland shrinks, the greater is the risk of increasing political control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee could discuss incidents over the past 10, 15, 20 or 30 years in which the politics of policing have become blurred. But that is not what we want. The Committee has a vested interest in avoiding any politicisation of the police services as they struggle to impose law and order. However, the Minister must assure Opposition Members that we are not dealing with the subtext of another agenda that never comes before the Committee but which is always evident in the comments of Ministers and their allies in the Scottish Conservative party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a fourth issue that worries Opposition Members. I shall quote Dumfries and Galloway regional council, which I believe is the host council for the Secretary of State for Scotland and for the Under-Secretary of State. In a briefing, the council made a point of saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Police—stop the sweeping power to be given to the Secretary of State and retain need for Public Inquiry before amalgamation of police forces."</p></blockquote>
That briefing does not come from the most extreme council in the United Kingdom. There are no Wandsworths, or Westminsters, or Kyle and Carricks in that part of the world. However, that regional council—which will become a single-tier, all-purpose authority—is saying, unashamedly, that it is worried about the Secretary of State's power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Elsewhere in the briefing, Dumfries and Galloway regional council states about clause 34 that it wants to
	<br><blockquote><p>"delete the new power to Secretary of State and leave legislation as at present … current legislation only permits amalgamation in the interests of efficiency and following a public inquiry. This clause substitutes a lesser test and negates the need for an inquiry."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0644">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1161</span>
That leads on to our fourth concern: this Government are obsessed with cost. Clearly, there must be a balance between cost effectiveness and the efficiency of our police forces. But we do not trust the Government, and certainly not if they get this power. The Government are very good at introducing arguments about value for money, sound money and cost effectiveness, but police forces cannot be cost driven because the logical outcome of such an approach is that the amount of cash invested is deflated while extra output is squeezed out. We are alarmed that cost pressures will be one of the key considerations behind the Secretary of State's possibly irresponsible use of the powers that the Committee might give him today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our concerns are motivated only by a desire to curb a Secretary of State who is hungry for new powers. The amendment should be accepted. The Government must make a choice and the Minister's response must be careful. The Minister must reassure not just the Committee, but the police forces in Scotland, the local authorities and COSLA. We should not leave this debate without cast iron guarantees that if the Secretary of State takes on extra powers, which we believe are not necessary, he must be curtailed in exercising them, especially as the Government's track record on law and order is so poor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 368 is designed to tackle all that. My hon. Friends will wish to develop further the issues involved. If the Minister does not accept the amendment, he is throwing into doubt his concerns for the democratic process and for consultation. He will therefore be heaping much contempt on not just the Committee, but the people of Scotland and the police forces that serve them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause gives the Secretary of State the power to undertake amalgamation schemes. The Opposition believe that such schemes are unnecessary and will detract from the real role of the police in Scotland. Given the provisions of the Bill as a whole, however, we understand that it will be necessary to undertake those schemes because there will be eight police forces and 30 plus police authorities. That takes us back to the contentious problems that are likely to arise out of the amalgamation schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister told us that the special grant that the Secretary of State for Scotland provides to encourage local authorities to give priority to the police service will be cash limited in future. That means that it is no longer a priority for the Government. After giving a cash limit to local authorities, the Government will leave it to the authorities to provide extra funding for policing if required. If the authorities want to go beyond the funding that the Government are prepared to make available, they are on their own and will have to fund 100 per cent. the extra policing that they want in their areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister told us also that the joint boards will decide the police budgets. The chief constable will, presumably, submit a budget to the joint board which will then approve or disapprove that budget. We want to know more about the joint boards. Who will determine the ratio of councillors from each authority on the boards? What criteria will be applied? Will it be a question of the relative size of population? Will Dundee, which has the largest population on Tayside, have the largest number of councillors on the joint board? Is that how it will work? Dundee has 38 per cent. of the population, so I assume it
	<span class='label label-info column'>1162</span>
will have 38 per cent. of the places on the joint board. The Minister must clarify that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the amalgamation scheme will determine how much each council will pay toward the cost of the police budget in the police force area. He must say something about the criteria that will be applied in the amalgamation scheme. Will it be, as my hon. Friend the Member for Govan suggested, purely on the basis of population, so that Dundee, which has 38 per cent. of the population, will fund 38 per cent. of the police activity in Tayside? Or will it be on the basis of the prevalence of crime? Dundee has a much higher incidence of crime, so will it be expected to fund the policing required to deal with such crime? If, for example, Dundee has 40 to 50 per cent. of crime in the Tayside area, and 40 to 50 per cent. of the police resources allocated to fighting crime in the area, will be be responsible for paying 40 to 50 per cent. of the Tayside budget? The Minister should make that clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is the case, the Minister will need up-to-date statistics. If he wants to decide how much money will be spent the following year, and bases that on the level of crime in particular areas, he will need to know the up-to-date level of crime in each given area. At the moment, crime statistics are lagging well behind budgets. I do not understand how the Minister can apply that particular criteria, or will it be done simply on social and economic factors? Will the levels of poverty, urban deprivation and single parents—the hon. Member for Tayside, North has resumed his seat—be applied in allocating how much each council will pay for its particular area?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that it was up to the authorities themselves to agree on the criteria that will be applied in deciding how much each will be responsible for in funding the police budget. It is highly likely that there will be a failure to agree in the new police force area. I cannot envisage that the people of Angus will be prepared to fund police activity that takes place exclusively within the Dundee area—I would not blame them for taking that position. If they pay 31 per cent. or whatever it is of the police budget, they will rightly insist that they get their money's worth—that 31 per cent. of police activity should be in the Angus area, irrespective of the crime level within the Dundee area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is highly probable that there would be a failure to agree between Dundee, Angus, Perth and Kinross. The Minister says that in no circumstances will the Secretary of State intervene to force an agreement on the authorities. When a Secretary of State intervenes, the Minister must have some idea of what criteria the Secretary of State will apply, when he tells each council how much it must pay towards the police budget in the Tayside police force area. I want the Minister to tell us exactly what that criteria will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am particularly concerned by subsection 2(f), on page 29 of the Bill. It provides
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the transfer or retransfer to"—</p></blockquote>
another police authority—
	<br><blockquote><p>"of any officers, property, rights or liabilities affected by the scheme."</p></blockquote>
That clause gives the Secretary of State the power to say to people in the Tayside area, "Angus has 31 per cent. of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0645">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1163</span>
the population. You're getting 31 per cent. of the police, 31 per cent. of the police cars, 31 per cent. of police computers, and so on. That will be transferred from the Dundee police authority to the Angus authority. Similarly, Perth and Kinross will have a certain percentage transferred to them." If that is what the Minister is about, he had better tell the Committee. He had better make it clear what criteria the Secretary of State will apply in those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also concerned that, due to the pressure that will undoubtedly be placed on the new authorities over available money to spend on policing, they will be compelled to study ways of reducing the police budget for which they are responsible. During the morning and afternoon sittings of the Committee today, I was alarmed to read in the Library an article from the February 1994 edition of the magazine 	<i>Police,</i> which we are told is the voice of the service. Richard Coyles, national chairman of the Police Federation, expressed his fears about privatisation of police services. I know that Conservative Members are anxious to hear the views of the Police Federation. Richard Coyles referred to a Home Office review instituted at the turn of the year in England and Wales, which was
	<br><blockquote><p>"a review of police core and ancillary tasks".</p></blockquote>
What are police core and ancillary tasks in relation to the police? If such a review is being made in England and Wales, is such a review planned for Scotland, or does it extend to England and Wales only?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about the distinction between police core activities and ancillary tasks carried out by the police. Which activity is placed into which category? For example, are traffic duties considered a core activity for the police, or can they be undertaken by other organisations? May that be up for privatisation under the new schemes? We need to know the Government's thinking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Automobile Association is already describing itself in advertisements as the fourth emergency service. Is that an indication that maybe the Automobile Association, Royal Automobile Club or Securicor could be given the traffic groups currently undertaken by the police as a means of cutting down the police budget? That point is of particular interest to the Committee, and the Minister should respond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the police be responsible for the Government's proposed toll roads or will another authority be asked, under market testing or direct privatisation, to take over policing responsibilities in that area? Is community liaison essentially a core activity for the police or will that responsibility be taken from them?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Dundee, the north east "Safer Cities" campaign is working effectively for crime prevention and the police are intimately involved with that. Would that be regarded as an ancillary task that should not necessarily be performed by police officers and could be contracted out to others?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. The clause relates to amalgamations. It does not cover all the duties
	<span class='label label-info column'>1164</span>
of the police service. We seem to be going down a different track.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been listening to the hon. Member for Dundee, East. As the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As always, Sir James, you chair the Committee immaculately. Perhaps "immaculate" is not the right word because it brings to mind the immaculate conception. However, if the hon. Member for Ayr wishes to respond to any of my points, I am sure that you will give him the leeway to do that. I see that he has decided not to respond because he does not have an answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amalgamation schemes will determine for how much each authority will be responsible when it meets a police budget. If the new Dundee authority has to pay for the level of policing in that authority and only the authority pays, there will be pressure on it to find ways to reduce that burden. The authority may be forced to contract out or market test many of the services currently provided by the police. That seriously concerns Labour Members. It should concern Conservative Members, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just because something is market tested does not mean that the money will be available to spend on core police activities. The article in 	<i>Police</i> states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Recently the Metropolitan Police signed a £96 million contract with Securicor for the transport of all remand prisoners between courts and prisons in London."</p></blockquote>
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> My hon. Friends will laugh, but given Securicor's record, they should laugh—[HON. MEMBERS: "Group 4."] I apologise to anyone representing Securicor. I was thinking of Group 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That contract does not mean that £96 million is left to spend on core activities. The £96 million goes to Securicor. Officers carrying out the duties are simply moved or sacked. They are no longer employed by the authority. The money goes to another agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Privatisation and market testing do not make extra resources available to police authorities. It takes money from the police budget that would otherwise have been spent in that budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman shakes his head, but it would be interesting to know why.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should be aware of the profits made from contracting out services. On the transport service, the Metropolitan police saved many millions of pounds a year, compared to the cost of providing the service. That money is available to be invested in other areas. If one can perform a task more cheaply, resources can be diverted to other functions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If profits were made, they would have been paid to the shareholders of Securicor or another organisation providing the service. I would rather see the money spent on the service than paid out in dividends to shareholders or strengthening the company's financial base. Companies are about making profits, not about
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0646">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1165</span>
providing services to people. Keeping activities in the public sector means that every penny is spent on services and nothing goes in dividends to shareholders or anyone else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman bases his case on the false premise that everything in the public sector is done efficiently. If that were so, one would not be able to make the savings that have been turned into profits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The alleged savings made through privatisation or market testing have nothing to do with increasing efficiency and everything to do with reducing wages and conditions for those who work in the public sector or for private sector contracts. That is what it is all about. Wherever that has happened in Tayside, the workers get a worse deal. That is where the Government make their money, not through greater efficiency or better services. The experience of market testing and privatisation is that everyone is worse off except those who make profits out of the services that were previously provided by the public sector. That is the truth and just because Conservative Members disagree, that does not change the reality. That is the experience of ordinary people in Scotland who have been subject to market testing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If what the hon. Gentleman says is true, how come the Tory party is standing at 13 per cent. in the opinion polls? It is because of issues such as privatisation and market testing that the Tories are so unpopular.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend like to comment on a worrying situation that may develop? What happens if a police board pursues sensible, sane policies regarding in-house services, but the new police authority of Kyle and Carrick, for example, as a contributory authority to the police board, disagrees with that board's findings? The new authority could withdraw from certain functions or exert undue pressure to try and change the system. Would the Secretary of State again have to make a decision between the ideology of the market and the ideology of common sense?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend points out the main criticism of amalgamation schemes. The prospect of agreement between Labour authorities that are concerned about providing a good service in their area, and authorities such Kyle and Carrick, which are concerned only with reducing council tax and public services to the minimum, is nil. There will be no agreement. The Secretary of State has been given reserve powers to determine the amalgamation schemes—they will be determined according to his criteria. That is why it is so important to know the criteria that will apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I challenge the hon. Gentleman on his statement. Kyle and Carrick authority has not reduced its council tax, but has held it at a set level. It has been criticised by the Labour party for spending money in the coming year using revenue relating to capital projects. That is the opposite of everything that the hon. Gentleman is suggesting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I mixed up Stirling with Kyle and Carrick district council. They are both Tory councils which have no problem in admitting that their priority is
	<span class='label label-info column'>1166</span>
to keep the council tax at an absolute minimum. If that means cutting services, they will do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the real issue is not the level of council tax but whether Kyle and Carrick will introduce Spanish security firms to oversee the police work in the area, as it is about to do with other services, or will that lead to pressure regarding privatisation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, my hon. Friend makes a fair point. Kyle and Carrick now has a national reputation for looking for private contractors to provide services. Spanish companies appear to be attracting it at present. I notice that Tories are attracted to Spaniards of one kind or another these days. I think that Lady Buck, or whatever her name is, is a Spaniard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's point is fundamental. The Government are reorganising, in essence, the existing police structures in Scotland. They are not doing it because those police structures require reorganisation, but as a by-product of another enterprise—the reorganisation of local government. They want to create Tory enclaves around Scotland and ensure a few Tory councils by gerrymandering local boundaries. As a by-product of that main effort, they are interfering with the structures of the police forces in Scotland and making it far more difficult to police Scotland in future. In fact, the Government are putting at risk the protection and the law and order afforded to our citizens for their own party political ends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government think that they have hit rock bottom by a showing of 13 per cent. in the Scottish opinion polls, let them wait until they see the reults of the regional council elections in May and the European elections in June. What is more important for Conservative members of the Committee is the next general election, when they will pay the ultimate price for messing around with the people of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I trust that the hon. Gentleman is not suggesting that the policy of the Tayside police, for example, in matters affecting operational decisions will be in any way affected by changes made with regard to local government. As he and I know, the Tayside police are run operationally by the chief constable, and that will not be changed by anything in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also point out to the hon. Gentleman—and I trust that he will remember it—that my share of the poll at the election was better than his and that it will be again at the next one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those are brave words from the hon. Member for Tayside, North and I shall leave the matter to the people of Tayside to decide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman thinks that because the chief constable has operational control of the police, he will be able to implement the policing that he wants in Tayside, he has not been paying attention to the Bill. The hon. Gentleman should examine the amalgamation schemes that will be set up under the clause, the powers that are being given to the Secretary of State and the funding that is being made available for policing in the Tayside area. The chief constable controls none of that. He can provide policing only as far as the funds made available to him
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0647">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1167</span>
allow. The new set-up will ensure that fewer funds will be available for policing in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No mistakes should be made about this. The Minister announced this morning a subterfuge of cash-limiting the special grants to policing in Scotland to an agreed level, beyond which authorities will be left on their own to fund, up to 100 per cent., as many police as they want. Councils will be under severe pressure, because of the local government changes, in providing services at the level that they do now. There will not be 100 per cent. extra funding from the new police authority to enable extra police to be put on the streets. Fewer funds will be available for policing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the chief constable retains operational control, he has no control over the level of spending on police activities in his area. That will be a matter for the new police authorities and, ultimately, for the Secretary of State for Scotland, who controls them by controlling their purse strings. There is no point in the hon. Gentleman's trying to take refuge in the fact that police authorities can raise the council tax. If they do that, their expenditure will be capped by the Secretary of State for Scotland and they will be punished for going beyond certain levels of increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From whatever angle the matter is approached, the measure is bad news for people who live in Scotland, and particularly for those in areas of high crime which require high levels of policing. They will not get that in future, as a direct result of the changes that the Bill introduces.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend spoke about the allocation of costs of the police service between the component authorities of the new police boards and he speculated about whether that would be based on population or the incidence of crime within the new authorities' boundaries. It strikes me in that regard that, unfortunately, offenders do not always have regard to local authority boundaries in deciding where to commit crimes. It is just possible that whereas there may be a higher incidence of crime in Dundee than in Perth and Kinross or Angus, a proportion of the crimes in Dundee may well be perpetrated, by citizens of Angus, or even Perth and Kinross—or even Lothian, goodness knows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a serious point to what I am saying. It would be absurd to try to allocate costs on the basis of the incidence of crime. The allocation will have to be based on population. It would be very useful if the Minister would clarify the Government's intentions. It would be outrageous for the people of Dundee or of Glasgow to have to foot the entire bill for the policing of crimes perpetrated not only by their citizens, but by people from other parts of Scotland. There must be an equitable way to distribute the costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before you rule me out of order again, Sir James, I shall turn my attention to the amendment. I support if as it would ensure better scrutiny of the new power, sought by the Secretary of State, to amalgamate police forces—and greater accountability. But why is the Secretary of State seeking to make it easier to amalgamate police forces? My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central was right to refer to representations from Dumfries and Galloway. The Dumfries and Galloway constabulary is the smallest in the United Kingdom—and an excellent one, as it
	<span class='label label-info column'>1168</span>
showed over and again during the Lockerbie case. It has done much good work there. It has shown that in co-operation with Strathclyde and other forces, it can operate as efficiently as any other force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have good policing in Scotland in well-established police areas, with chief constables and police authorities doing their jobs. Why is the Secretary of State seeking new powers to bring about amalgamations? That could be unsettling. Indeed, anything that increases the Government's power to apply pressure on police authorities or chief constables is deplorable. We have an independent police service in this country and we want to maintain it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Minister might say, "We don't like the way in which you are doing your job. If you do not do it in a certain way, we will promote an amalgamation scheme, which would put you out of business and cause you to amalgamate with a neighbouring police force." That would be deplorable, so the Minister must explain why he is seeking this new power. If there is no good reason for having such an enhanced power to facilitate amalgamations, the Committee would be doing its duty for the maintenance of good policing in Scotland if we were to throw out this clause, or at the very least accept the amendment, which would provide further safeguards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a final point of detail. One of my life's ambitions has been to catch out parliamentary draftsmen, and I think that I may have done it. I think that the Government have already achieved an amalgamation. Clause 34(2) refers to the existing Fife constabulary remaining as the Fife police force, and in the table, Stirling, Clackmannan and Falkirk are included in the Central Scotland police area. I think that Kincardine is covered by Fife police force and that it is also part of the Clackmannan and Falkirk local authority area, so there is an amalgamation—indeed, an overlapping police authority. It would be nice if the Minister or the parliamentary draftsmen could tell me that I am right and they are wrong. If so, I would feel much better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be happy to consider the drafting points that the hon. Gentleman raised, and if he has picked up an anomaly, I shall see that it is put right at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East asked about a review of police core activities. The Scottish Office is in close touch with the Home Office review. We should ensure that police efforts are properly focused on their central purpose. It is far too early to speculate on the outcome of the review. This proposal is not a new idea. In the past decade, powers to deal with stray dogs have been conferred on local authorities so that the police are freed from such a task. The Scottish office has no preconceptions about what more might be done and by whom to minimise extraneous burdens on the police. I take the point made by the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley that too much police time is taken up in court, and we want to ensure that they are released to concentrate on their more pressing duties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a helpful point. Was the Minister referring to court attendance? Did he mean the duties

involved in looking after people attending court? I was referring to police witnesses in court as well as police on duty in court. I agree that we should consider whether police on duty in court could be replaced by attendants, such as we have in the House of Commons. Does the Minister accept that there is an important job to be done to ensure that police do not have to hang around in court for too long waiting to give evidence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said earlier, a statement will be made and proposals will be put forward in due course to minimise the burden on the police. The hon. Gentleman will have to be patient, but the proposals will be forthcoming and will be published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 368 would reinstate the existing provisions of section 20 of the Police (Scotland) Act 1967 requiring a public inquiry in the case of amalgamation schemes proposed by the Secretary of State. Our reason for removing the requirement for a public inquiry is simple: we wish to remove the long period of uncertainty that would surround a public inquiry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Secretary of State were to propose changes to the combined police areas established under the Bill, he would consult fully and he would be obliged to give his reasons for not accepting objections put to him during consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that the Secretary of State might use his power to establish amalgamation schemes as a back-door method of creating a national police force. I have to tell the Committee that that is a fanciful idea. We have no intention of proceeding down that path. Indeed, there was strong opposition to it on consultation. We have not altered the existing number of police forces. If the Government had wanted to create a national police force in Scotland, which they do not, we would hardly have perpetuated the eight existing forces in the Bill. If we wanted in future to create a national force, section 20 of the Police (Scotland) Act 1967 would not be the appropriate means of doing so, with or without a public inquiry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the Committee that if there are amendments to the provisions for amalgamation schemes in the Police and Magistrates' Courts Bill, the implications for Scotland will be carefully considered. I cannot accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central asked a specific question about the representations that we have all received from Dumfries and Galloway. Earlier today—obviously at the wrong moment, because your co-Chairman, Sir James, said that I had chosen an inappropriate time for my question—I asked about the Dumfries and Galloway representations on what it views as the accumulating of more power to the central authority—in this case the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend said, Dumfries and Galloway is not exactly a revolutionary force. It is cautious. What is the Government's answer to the representations that the Committee has received? The force deserves an answer to its question about power accruing to the central authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The experience that I had with the Dumfries and Galloway police force was gained particularly after the Lockerbie episode. It was
	<span class='label label-info column'>1170</span>
the smallest force in Scotland, so it drew resources and assistance particularly from Strathclyde police. The police carried out an extremely effective and successful investigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where there is a requirement for a small authority to obtain the assistance of a neighbouring police authority, experience has shown that the assistance has been forthcoming in a strong and effective way. I have every reason to suppose that that will continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, I do not want to digress, but the Minister said that the Lockerbie investigation was successful. It evidently has not been. I am immersed in the subject and had an Adjournment debate on it. Whether the investigation was effective is open to argument, but it would have been a great deal better if it had been handled by a bigger force. That does not answer the question about the centralisation of authority. What is the answer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At this stage, we are not convinced of the argument that there should be fewer than eight police forces in Scotland. At Lockerbie, Dumfries and Galloway police co-operated extremely successfully with other forces which assisted it in the aftermath of that international atrocity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman fears greater centralisation. There will be no greater powers for the Secretary of State. All that is at issue is the procedure to be followed before the powers can be exercised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is a writer of good books. He should read Lester Coleman's "On The Trail Of The Octopus" and David Leppard's "On The Trail Of Terror". He might feel differently about the effectiveness of the investigations of small forces.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the debate and have read a certain amount of relevant material. I also talked to members of the central Scotland police when anxiety about Sheehy was prevalent. At that time, they were conscious also of the forthcoming local government reorganisation. They were very worried about the possibility of an amalgamation that would not make sense and which would be less effective and less efficient. Both of those are important criteria for local police services. They were worried that any new system would be less efficient and less effective than the present system that has developed in central Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remain very concerned about the provisions in clause 35(2)(d), which states that an amalgamation may provide
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the dissolution and winding up of any joint police board constituted under a pre-existing amalgamation scheme, or for the reconstitution of any such board".</p></blockquote>
The fact that such a provision is in the Bill allows the Secretary of State to amend the eight police forces referred to in clause 34, despite the warm words that have been expressed this evening. Those forces exist only for as long as the Secretary of State wishes. They can be changed by the Secretary of State at any time. I do not believe that the Secretary of State has denied that. Perhaps he will wish to rise to speak about that subsection specifically, because it should worry every police constable, every senior policeman and every member of the public who is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0649">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1171</span>
concerned about the present system of policing and who supports that present policing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is very odd that the Secretary of State should have kept, in clause 23—when we were arguing about specific decentralisation—a reserve power to force decentralisation in any other local government area. Yet in clause 35, the Secretary of State preserves to himself a power to amalgamate. There seems to be a contradiction there. I am sure that the public will ask, with me, what it is that drives the Secretary of State to think that amalgamation in the police area—we shall talk about fire services later—is the way to leave the door open. That is the way in which the minds of the civil servants or of the people who advise the Secretary of State are running in relation to the police, yet the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) said that, in relation to other local government services, decentralisation was what had emerged over the past 20 or so years of local government and that that was what needed to be implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We began the debate by talking about local government and the contradiction that would arise from the present proposals for change. That contradiction was that local government, although it would gather scale and beneficial economies of scale on the one hand, would be found to be too far away from the people to deliver services sensitively and in a way that the public would consider correct. Why is it thought now that policing should not be close to the people? Why is it thought that policing should be less sensitive and more about amalgamation, growth and large sizes than about breaking down into smaller units? Why should not police forces reflect not just police authorities, but police votes and policing policies that also break down into smaller units? Why should the police services, of all services, be regarded as appropriate for a storm-trooper approach that sees things in terms of brigades and divisions instead of delivery of services?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot speak for other police forces, but the hon. Member for Dundee, East will confirm that Tayside police has been broken down operationally under the control of three separate superintendents. One deals directly with them in connection with policing policy matters. That system seems to work supremely well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That point is well made. A similar breakdown exists within the central Scotland divisions. Strangely enough, the combinations are Stirling and Clackmannan as division A, and Falkirk district as division B. The Minister seems to have listened to the debates on boundaries and yet has come to no conclusions about whether that also makes sense for the rest of local government services. The hon. Member for Tayside, North may be able to confirm that there are similar schemes in other areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have community safety schemes in which community policing is prevalent. I have been at a number of meetings in my constituency where community safety has been set up in a sub-division. For example, the towns of Bo'ness Grangemouth and the Braes area which is run from the police station in Maddiston, have now broken down into further divisions. The trend in the operational effect of the way in which services are delivered parallels
	<span class='label label-info column'>1172</span>
the other good practice of breaking down into local areas. Why is the Secretary of State, and the trend in the Bill, going away from that good practice and towards amalgamation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Wilson, the chief constable in central Scotland, has been a driving force in community policing methodology. The chief superintendent in Falkirk is similarly very much in favour of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why does not the Bill reflect the good policing practice? Why does it not mention smaller schemes? I believe that it is because the Government are thinking in terms of state policing. They are being advised by people who think in terms of larger police forces with common decisions where levers can be pulled and where the forces of the police are not protective. I think it is silly, but there are still some spectres from the time when the police forces were used like a national police force during the miners' strike. One could not travel from Scotland to Yorkshire withot being stopped by police personnel. They were not even necessarily Yorkshire police: they had been moved from London or from other police forces in England and Wales to where people were crossing borders. That should have been avoided, but it set a trend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would bring common sense to the Bill. It would mean that if there were an amalgamation scheme, people on the ground would be consulted. It should not be done in a dark room somewhere in the Scottish Office or in London where the state planners think about the police as a state institution. They should talk to the people in the police forces, who now see themselves as a community service. The greatest community service that they can give is to create a community where safety is something in which everyone participates. I have been very impressed by what I have seen at community safety meetings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not just individuals who usually take part in community safety meetings; many people attend who work with youth, in the drugs field and in the caring services. Members of the public who usually grumble and gripe and feel oppressed by the insecurity that comes from bad policing are represented. All those people attend community safety meetings and their opinion is much more important to me and to those whom I represent. I know from the attending meetings that I have attended, as policemen have told me, that those people are much more important than those who sit in the Scottish Office and plan policing as some sort of oppressive institution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not just oppressive of the criminals—I wish that it was so oppressive in that respect that we did not have our appalling rates of crime detection. They are poor, but, in central Scotland they are improving. The chief constable's report states that that is because of community involvement and the community safety scheme. People are now joining together in policing and looking after their own communities rather than letting it be done from above by a monolithic police force. That is what is lacking in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister shows a complete lack of vision. I do not know as much about policing as I do about special education, but the Minister showed an unwillingness
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0650">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1173</span>
earlier to listen to people who know about special education. The same question stands: where are the people who really care about the people on the ground? Where are the people in the Scottish Office who think not in terms of mechanistic, administrative arrangements but in terms of the effective involvement of the community and association by the community with their police forces? They are not the people who drafted clauses 34 and 35.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some amendments could be made if the Government took on board the sense, if not the words, of amendment No. 368. If they do not do that, they will be seen to be designing the Bill to fit in with another scheme—not the one that will get people local government services or good policing. The Bill is going in the opposite direction of all good common sense. Sadly, it looks as though, once again, the Minister, the Scottish Office draftsmen and the civil servants do not know what they are talking about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pity to have to delay the Committee, but the issues are vital. With respect, we heard from the Minister more about stray dogs than about the future structure of police services in Scotland. I do not mind a bit of slapstick, and stray dogs are important. Local authorities now provide valuable services to deal with that problem. However, that pales into insignificance compared with the draconian powers that the Secretary of State seeks to take upon himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister merely dismissed the amendment, without justification or explanation of why the Secretary of State wants to amalgamate on a whim of political prejudice or of cost effectiveness. The Committee expects better from the Minister. Over the past two or three clauses, we have been subjected to the most ridiculous replies when serious questions have been put to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The immediate establishment of eight boards against the backgroud of today's revelation of 30 police authorities causes concern, but our anxiety is about the future—	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Hayes) is not a member of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would rather not comment. If the Government needed their morale boosted, the hon. Gentleman obviously got the wrong side of the committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was talking about the future. We are concerned about the immediate prospects, but are anxious also about the future of the service. Will the Minister just walk away from his responsibilities as Her Majesty's Government's spokesman in Scotland on the issue? We should surely be able to expect a decent reply to the eminently reasonable question of why the Secretary of State wants those powers. Why will not the Minister accept the amendment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that public inquiries are not needed. We have got to the stage with this centralising monster of a Government that they just pay Up service to such matters. They do not want a public inquiry because it would take too long. Therefore, there is a time bar on democratic debate. It is utter rubbish for a Minister to say that. The Minister is treating with contempt not just the Committee, but a host of organisations and people in
	<span class='label label-info column'>1174</span>
Scotland. If the Government will not change their mind, they should at least explain why they will not accept a serious amendment, seriouly drafted, on a serious issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will say something more about that. If he does not, we shall be left with no conclusion other than that the Government do not care about the practical points that were made. It will do nothing to dampen the suspicion that, given the opportunity, God forbid, to return to this place with a majority, they will make moves toward a national police force. That is the ultimate logic of the farcical presentation of the Bill and of clause 35.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I offer the Minister a chance to redeem himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He does not deserve a chance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am more charitable than my hon. Friend and am being attacked for my generosity. The Minister would expect me to be generous because he needs another opportunity. I am sure that when he spoke earlier he had not appreciated full the weight of what was happening. I shall be delighted to hear him respond again to the amendment and, in particular, give reasons for not curtailing the Secretary of State's powers in the way that we want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A public inquiry is not necessary in those circumstances. Such inquiries can be time consuming and expensive. We consider that the powers are necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) asked about the reconstitution of joint boards as an option for the Secretary of State. There is nothing new in that. It is already provided for in section 21 of the Police (Scotland) Act 1967. There is nothing sinister about that. The hon. Member for East Lothian touched on that issue. I repeat that clause 35 is not a new power. That section of the 1967 Act allows the Secretary of State to make amalgamation schemes. That power was used in the case of the Borders to meet the points that the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire raised earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The powers are necessary. They continue what exists already and, in the circumstances, are altogether reasonable. I doubt that in the unlikely event of the Opposition forming a Government they would try to get rid of a power that has served their country well for many years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's response was no better than his earlier one. He has made a virtue of the fact that we do not need a public inquiry. He said that the current provisions allow people to have sensible consultation and to make representations. Line 12 on page 30 of the Bill, in clause 35, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"where any such authority submit objections to the scheme"—</p></blockquote>
this is about amalgamation—
	<br><blockquote><p>"inform that authority in writing whether he accepts the objections and, if he does not, why he does not."</p></blockquote>
The future structure of police forces in Scotland, and of amalgamations, is left to the Secretary of State to decide whether to listen to objections and then to write to the authority to say whether he accepts or rejects those objections. There is no reserve or residual power for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0651">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1175</span>
anyone to have a serious argument about the drive toward fewer police forces or, ultimately, a national police force. It is disgraceful that the Minister has twice not been willing to respond to that concern. The Minister is not only avoiding the issue, but is giving no clear and conclusive reasons for rejecting the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are bitterly disappointed. The Minister's stock has not risen in relation to the seriousness of the issue. We deplore the fact that the debate on such a serious issue ends with the Minister unable to justify what he is doing and, more importantly, giving us no clear advice on why he is willing to reject an amendment which, in a democracy, seems essential, especially when this crazy Government are joy riding through all the services in the way that they are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
