	<time>Thursday 10 March 1994</time>
	<p>	<i>(Morning)</i></p>
	<p>[MR. MICHAEL J. MARTIN 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Local Government etc. (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliament Under-Secretary of State for Scotland Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Are you able to give the Committee guidance on when television cameras will or will not be present in the Committee Room? I note that they are not here this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know that the Opposition have a close relationship with the broadcasters and have been timing debates so that the broadcasters turn up on particular mornings. I do not object to the relationship between the Opposition and certain broadcasters. However, I object to some members of the Committee and to others knowing when television cameras will be present. Is it possible to ensure that, if television cameras are to be present, all members of the Committee will know that beforehand?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Several hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not know what information other members of the Committee have, but I certainly do not know when a camera will turn up, so the rule is to turn out smartly dressed every morning. I assure the Minister that I have no knowledge of the matter that he raises and it is not a matter for me—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I did not say that no one knows, but simply that the Chair does not know when the cameras will turn up. But, as the scouts say, be prepared.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. Surely it is dangerous for a Minister of the Crown to imply that television cameras come here only because of an alleged link between Opposition Members in the Committee and members of the broadcasting media.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The application to televise proceedings in these Committees must be made in advance to the Select Committee on Broadcasting and that Select Committee—as the Whip appears to acknowledge—must make the decision. Plainly, the broadcasters base their decision on the newsworthiness of what they think will arise. If they think that the Minister will give an opening speech of interminable length, they might not regard that as even slightly newsworthy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, that was not my point of order. I wish to draw a much more serious matter to your attention, Mr. Martin. It relates to a previous ruling that you gave to the Committee on the use of the word "gerrymandering". You appeared to indicate that you would dep-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1000</span>
recate the use of the word in so far as it was an accusation levelled against individual members of the Committee and of the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I ask you to consider that ruling, Mr. Martin, in the light of the meeting that will take place this evening in Motherwell, chaired by the vice-chairman of the Conservative party in Scotland, Mr. Adrian Shinwell? The meeting, it is alleged, is being held at the behest of the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) and is designed to reopen the issue of Lanarkshire boundaries, which were determined earlier in the Committee's proceedings. It is being widely said that, this evening the small extinct species of Lanarkshire Tories will, on the back of a secondhand Tory leaflet, start drawing lines in Lanarkshire—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman said that he was raising a point of order, but it is not a matter for the Chair. Perhaps I may again give the hon. Gentleman guidance. I said that the term "gerrymandering" should not be applied to individual members of the Committee. An accusation that a political party is involved in gerrymandering is one thing; but certainly the team should not be directed at any member of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon
Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. When the Minister rose to speak, I had hoped that he would make a statement. Can you, Mr. Martin, ask the Minister whether he will make a statement about the fact that the boundaries of Luss seem to have been misunderstood or that he seems to have lost part of Luss? We are owed an explanation because it would appear, according to Councillor Norman Glen, who provided the maps for the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie)—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps we can get on with discussing clause 32, which is what we should be discussing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are we to have a statement on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I shall hear the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Is it not shameful that, repeatedly, the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson), who is supposedly a senior spokesman for the Labour party in Scotland, continually makes points of order which you say are not points of order? Surely, hon. Members have a responsibility to the Committee to at least be accurate when they address the Chair. Such senior hon. Members should understand that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0556">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1001</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When hon. Members raise what they see as points of order, I try to be helpful and sometimes have to tell them that they are not and there is no harm done. I allow hon. Members to raise matters. They should not feel intimidated about raising a point of order. In my experience, 90 per cent. are not matters for the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I have what I hope is a helpful point of order on which you may be able to assist every member of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether you, Mr. Martin, know that the 	<i>Hansard</i> report of the Tuesday afternoon sitting was not available this morning until just before proceedings began. I tried to obtain the report from the Vote Office at 9 o'clock, because the Committee is dealing with education as it did on Tuesday. I wanted accurately to check what Ministers and hon. Members said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If hon. Members are unable to obtain a copy of 	<i>Hansard</i> until they come into the Committee Room just before proceedings commence, they have great difficulty contributing with the sort of lucidity and helpfulness that Labour Members in particular hope to provide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am learning something every day. I understand that the Committee Office at the end of the Corridor had 	<i>Hansard</i> available from 7.30 am. If the hon. Gentleman makes further inquiries outside the Committee, he may be able to obtain 	<i>Hansard</i> a bit earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recall saying previously that 	<i>Hansard</i> staff do an excellent job. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] They are looking after several Committees and there is a great deal of pressure on them. It may help the hon. Gentleman if he made inquiries outside the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. All the inquiries that you suggest will be made. I checked with the Vote Office at 9.30 am and checked in the Committee office at 10.15 am, but it did not have a copy of 	<i>Hansard.</i> I absolutely assure every member of the Committee that I am not questioning the work of 	<i>Hansard</i> staff. It was explained to me that the problem had to do with the printers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now that the hon. Gentleman has put the matter on the record, I suggest that the authorities of the House should look into his legitimate complaint.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. My point of order concerns the disgraceful behaviour of the hon. Member for Hamilton. He is putting the Committee, and I believe, you in difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At almost every sitting, he makes a point of order which contains disgraceful allegations about the Government and Conservative Members. You, Mr. Martin, then rightly and properly rule that the point of order is not a matter for you. That makes it impossible for Conservative Members to respond; the matter has
	<span class='label label-info column'>1002</span>
been ruled out of order and we cannot raise a point of order relating to it. A great deal of difficulty is being created.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to hear a point of order before I can rule on it. It is up to hon. Members how they conduct their affairs, but if they raise a point of order, I have to give them a hearing. It is as simple as that and I can say no more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. In 	<i>The Guardian</i> this morning, the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Prime Minister, the hon. Member for Luton, South (Mr. Bright), threatened that education authorities would be abolished. We are discussing education committees, so will the Minister assure us later that that threat to abolish education committees will not apply to Scotland? That could make an appreciable difference to the order of our business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not a matter for me. A Scottish Bill is before us and what the Prime Minister's Parliamentary Private Secretary says to the 	<i>The Guardian</i> has nothing to do with the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. It relates to a point that I have raised privately about maps in the Committee. I seek clarification that it is acceptable for me to provide maps to members of the Committee about the issues on which I shall speak. That will be done on the understanding that everything said will be understood by anyone body reading the record and who does not have recourse to the maps. If it is acceptable, I shall now provide maps to Conservative Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is absolutely nothing wrong with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 32</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>CO-OPERATION BETWEEN EDUCATION AUTHORITIES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 39, in page 27, line 19, leave out from "authority" to end of line 20 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"such arrangements shall continue after that Act is passed, notwithstanding anything in this Act to the contrary".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following: Government amendment No. 247.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Government new clause 5—	<i>Denominational schools: proposals under section 22D of Education (Scotland) Act 1980.</i></p>
	<p>Government new clause 6—	<i>Provision of school transport and other facilities.</i></p>
	<p>New clause 9—	<i>Educational expenses</i>—
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State shall give full regard to all related expenses incurred in respect of the provision of education as a result of the provisions in this Act, including the maintenance of current arrangements for the provision of transport for pupils when the levels of grant aided expenditure are being determined.".</p></blockquote></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0557">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1003</span>
	<p>New clause 14—	<i>School catchment areas</i>—
	<br><blockquote><p>".—After section 23 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 there shall be inserted—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'School catchment areas.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>23A. Nothing in the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 shall be construed so as to enable pupil catchment areas or feeder arrangements for primary/secondary associated schools in existence before the passing of that Act to be changed as a consequence thereof.'.".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>New clause 16—	<i>School transport</i>—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Each education authority shall be required to maintain at least the standards existing before the passing of this Act for the provision of transport for pupils in accordance with their duties under section 51 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980.".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments raise an emotive set of issues that deserve to be dealt with thoroughly. Some of the issues that will arise in this debate are at the very heart of the reorganisation that we are about to undertake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I discuss examples, for which the maps will be helpful, I want to be fair to the Government. A great deal of concern has been expressed about the potential dangers in the Bill and under reorganisation. I want to make it clear that I do not believe that it was ever the Government's intention that the Bill should in itself change catchment areas, nor do I believe that it was their intention to change the basis of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 or to abolish school transport across boundaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to realise that everyone in Scotland has feared the worst and that there has been a considerable campaign on these issues. People had little faith in the Government's good will. That says a great deal about the regard in which the Government are held. Virtually no one in Scotland was prepared to give the Government the benefit of the doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new powers that the Government are seeking in their new clauses need clarification as to whether they will lead to discrimination against non-denominational schools. Both the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of Scotland have made it clear that they want all schools to be treated equally. In those circumstances, the Government have to spell out whether they believe that the letter or the practice of the new clauses will discriminate for or against the non-denominational or the Catholic sectors. Although I accept that the Government do not intend reorganisation to have a discriminatory effect, I will be able to show that the way in which the legislation is applied will inevitably have such an effect. The Government must do something about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that the Government believe that they are simply updating existing legislation. There has been considerable furore about whether concessions have been made. An article in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> reporting an interview with the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Lord James stresses, however, that the amendments to assure Catholic parents that their catchment areas and transport arrangements are safeguarded are merely clarifications of the previous position".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1004</span>
That is not a concession, but simply a clarification of the previous position. The article, which, because it is in 	<i>The Scotsman,</i> must be true, also states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"he is keen also to stress the limited extent of changes. "There is no reason why catchment areas will be affected at all, and in the vast majority of cases, there will be no need for change'."</p></blockquote>
The way in which the system will operate will make it inevitable for individual local authorities, acting perfectly reasonably and rationally, to feel obliged to undertake change because of financial reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall discuss transport first. One of the Opposition's new clauses would include in legislation an undertaking that there will be no detrimental alteration to existing travel arrangements as a result of the changes and the ensuing financial arrangements. The statutory limits are two miles and three miles, yet many authorities operate limits of one mile and two miles. The present limits in Strathclyde are one mile for children attending primary school and two miles for those attending secondary school. The legal limit is two miles for the under-eights and three miles for the eights and over. Therefore, it would be entirely within the law for an eight-year-old who currently gets a bus for a mile and a yard to have to walk just under three miles in future. That is a clear deterioration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unacceptable for eight-year-olds to walk up to three miles. That is not the position in many parts of the country. The Government should be prepared to accept that they must not allow any deterioration. A clear statement in the Bill would be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman suggests that there are two bands. I presume that the eight-year-olds and over fall into the three-mile limit. My understanding is that that includes the eight-year-olds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not a tutorial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am just asking for clarification, which is perfectly reasonable. We could do without the ignorant interruption of the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that the legal figures are two miles for those aged up to eight and three miles for those aged eight and over. I see no heads shaking on the Government Benches, so I presume that that is correct. The figures in Strathclyde are one mile for all primary school children and two miles for all secondary school children. Therefore, there will obviously be a substantial deterioration for many children. Parents will not wish eight-year-olds to have to walk three miles. Understandably, in those circumstances they will want to pay for school transport if it is withdrawn by the local authority. We must recognise that that is effectively a fine on those parents, many of whom can ill afford it. That is why the Government should make a clear statement that no deterioration in school transport provision will be allowed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want now to explore with the Minister how decisions will be made about changes in catchment
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0558">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1005</span>
areas. To the best of my knowledge, under the existing system there is no problem when school catchment areas overlap local authority catchment areas. The Minister must spell out to us—if not today, later in writing, and also in reply to the many points that I shall raise—the process for closure or change of boundaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that there must be a change in the regulations by which school changes are made. The current legal minimum of 28 days written notice seems to be insufficient. The best practice of the vast majority of local authorities should be made statutory by an amendment to the appropriate regulations. I hope that the Minister will accept that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not clear to me—and the Minister will have to spell out—how decisions are to be made in the case of school catchment areas that cross boundaries. I understand that both sets of parents and both authorities are to be consulted, but it is not clear whether both authorities will have to agree; whether one will have a veto over the other's decisions; whether the authority covering a second school that is fed by a primary school for which diversion elsewhere is proposed would be able to overrule the decision; or whether the secondary school's authority would be able to hold on to the primary pupils, even against the wishes of the authority in which that primary school is situated. All those problems will arise at some time if the new system is introduced. The Minister must make it clear whether either local authority would have a veto.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would decisions be made by the authority covering the secondary school, that covering the primary school, or the initiating authority? If they did not agree, would the matter be left to the Minister? Would that happen only when boundaries were to be crossed or only when a request was made? Profound disagreements will sometimes arise and it should be made clear who will have the power to make decisions and in precisely what circumstances the Minister will be able to intervene.

It should be borne in mind that the measure is being introduced in the context of falling rolls and financial pressures. In those circumstances the status quo is not an option for many authorities. Population transfers and falling rolls will mean that circumstances are fluid and that changes will occur. I want the Minister to make it clear how he intends the system whereby money is to follow the pupil to operate. As he is aware, many schools that are operating at well under capacity will have higher costs per pupil than they otherwise would. It will be in a local authority's interest to keep the loading factor in its schools as high as possible, if it is being allocated an average cost per pupil. Therefore, rational local authorities will want catchments that provide them with the highest possible loading in their schools, to minimise the diseconomies. That will not necessarily be educationally beneficial to the youngsters, but is entirely rational for the local authorities, at a time of falling rolls and severe financial pressure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The outcome could be that one authority will effectively penalise another by taking decisions about catchment areas, or decisions that will affect school loading, that will have implications for other authorities, with-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1006</span>
out those other authorities being able to intervene. The Minister must explain how that will work and how individual authorities will escape being penalised by their neighbours. I recognise that the questions are technical and complex, but they are causing concern in the education community.

I should like to illustrate my point with examples, and initially with reference to the map of the Dumbarton, Clydebank, Argyll and Bute areas.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to come back to the question of Argyll and Bute and Dumbarton. St. Joseph's primary school is some eight to 10 miles from Our Lady and St. Patrick's high school. The cost of sending St. Joseph's pupils to that school is about £70,000 per year. It is not unreasonable, in those circumstances, for the Argyll and Bute authority to wonder whether its money would not be better spent in sending those pupils to the nearest secondary school, the non-denominational Hermitage academy, against which there can be few criticisms of an educational nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My understanding is that section 22D of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 is designed to maintain the opportunity for Catholic primary and secondary education for those pupils whose parents want it and whose numbers warrant it. In these circumstances, a referral to the Minister would be likely to bring about the refusal of any approach from Argyll and Bute to have youngsters from St. Joseph's primary school diverted away from the nearest Catholic secondary school and sent to a non-denominational secondary school. It would be helpful if the Minister could spell out to us whether that is the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would also be helpful if the Minister could spell out what he would do if asked to intervene in circumstances in which the Dumbarton and Clydebank authority was prepared to make adjustments either to the capacity or to the roll of Our Lady and St. Patrick's high school in such a way as would no longer leave room for the youngsters from St. Joseph's. They would then have no Catholic secondary school in their own authority, and no opportunity of accessing the nearest Catholic secondary school.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I return to the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian. I find the Minister's response quite astonishing. Is he seriously saying that the Scottish Office, with all the knowledge that it claims to have, cannot tell us how many secondary and primary schools will be in each of the new authorities? How can we have a serious debate about boundary questions and catchments areas and overlaps if we do not know which schools we are dealing with? I shall ask the Minister later how many schools and pupils will be affected by catchment crossovers. If he does not know how many schools there are in each authority we cannot have much confidence in his ability to give a proper answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason why we do not have that information centrally is that COSLA has refused to give it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister seriously telling the Committee that, given all the bureaucracy in St. Andrew's house, there is no list of schools in Scotland? Every time the Minister needs any information, does he have to go to COSLA to find it? I do not believe that. It is kidology and it brings us into disrepute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not St. Andrew's house carry out inspections of the schools? Does not it have an inspectorate that goes round schools, and publishes reports? How can the inspectorate function if it does not know where the schools are, or how many there are?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I was chairman of the COSLA education committee I confess that sometimes I saw a queue of inspectors at Rosebery house waiting at the desk for instructions. Perhaps a name was just picked out of a hat, but that would cause some problems because many schools have the same name. For example, I can think of two Trinity schools, one in Renfrew and one in Cambuslang. In fact, that proposition makes sense when one considers some of the reports published by the inspectorate. One thinks, "This isn't the school I know", Then finds out that the report refers to a different school in a different part of the country. The Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Eastwood, should do better than that. The subject is too important for such political games.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that, while we obviously have a list of the schools in Scotland, we do not have a full map of the catchment areas? My hon.

	<br><blockquote><p>"the number of … secondary and … primary schools for each of those authorities."</p></blockquote>
It does not ask for exact details of catchment areas. It merely and reasonably seeks to find out the number of schools physically situated within the boundaries of each of the new authorities. The Minister has maps, and a list of the schools in Scotland, as has been admitted. He should have a clearer idea than we of where the new boundaries will fall, because he wrote the proposals. Under those circumstances it should be perfectly easy to match school locations to the new boundaries. He is treating the Committee in an offhand manner if he cannot be bothered to answer the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman not agree that the Government have devolved responsibilities to local authorities and expect those authorities to carry out their duties in a reasonable and practicable manner? The fact that the authorities have not acknowledged that they should at times pass back information to the Government when requested is a good argument for changing the present structures of Scottish local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a difference between delegation and abdication. The Minister is saying that you do not know where Scotland's schools are. You have lost some of them—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having raised several points about St. Joseph's, Dumbarton, I shall discuss another school—St. Ambrose, in North Lanarkshire. A map of the area shows that the feeders for St. Ambrose include two schools within the Glasgow boundary, both of which are physically closer to secondary schools in Glasgow than to St. Ambrose. In such circumstances, it would not be unreasonable for the Glasgow authority to consider saving transport costs by transferring pupils from St. Bridget's and St. Francis to either St. Andrew's, Carntyne, St. Leonards's, Easterhouse or to both. Not only would that save transport costs because they are closer, but it would save money by placing a greater loading on St. Andrew's and St. Leonard's.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0561">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1011</span>
Glasgow would not be behaving unreasonably in such a scenario, but it could have consequences for St. Ambrose. The transfer of pupils away from St. Ambrose could result in increased surplus capacity in St. Ambrose, which would increase the cost per pupil. North Lanarkshire authority would then be financially penalised, might result in St. Ambrose becoming unviable. It might lead to the necessity for a reorganisation in the Coatbridge and Airdrie areas of North Lanarkshire. Could any of those decisions that might be taken by Glasgow, with the consequences that I mentioned, be legitimately overturned by the Secretary of State under the proposed clauses?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend accepts that I share his deep concern. St. Bartholemew's is my ex-primary school and my brother-in-law is the principal physical education teacher there. I would be deeply concerned if the Minister could not answer those questions and assure the people of Townhead and the surrounding areas that their education service will be guarantee. We do no want a hope and a prayer, but a firm guarantee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If Glasgow proposes to move pupils from St. Francis and St. Bridget's either to St. Andrews, St. Leonard's or to a combination of the two, against the wishes of North Lanarkshire, even if North Lanarkshire is consulted, will the Minister tell us who decides?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Glasgow would have a minority of pupils attending St. Andrew's so would it have the power to override any opposition from North Lanarkshire and St. Ambrose? Could it transfer pupils out, against the wishes of the majority of parents of that school?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that the Minister might say that pupils could continue to attend St. Ambrose if their parents chose. I am sure he is aware that, under parental choice of a particular school, local authorities are under no obligation to provide transport funding. Many parents could not afford to pay the transport costs or, if they did, it would be at the expense of something else in the family budget. That would cause difficulties for the families involved, irrespective of the difficulties that it causes the local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman. Is he talking about pupils currently at the schools or children whose elder brothers and sisters attend the schools? If he is, that provision is already covered.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All those issues mostly concern the future of pupils who are not yet attending the school. I shall discuss the issue of siblings later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I deal with the issues surrounding St. Ninian's in Eastwood? That school was built to cater for youngsters from South Pollock and Eastwood; it was specifically designed to take in the Catholic parishes that include St. Angela's and St. Louise's primary schools in Pollock,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1012</span>
and the Catholic primary schools in Eastwood, as shown in the general map.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
St. Ninian's school is reaching capacity and something will have to be done. The school could either be physically expanded, which has capital implications and we would need to consider the most sensible way to spend the money, or it could be reorganised in one of two ways. The youngsters at St. Angela's and St. Louise's primary schools in Glasgow could go to a Catholic secondary in Glasgow, probably Bellarmine or its successor, or St. Cadoc's primary could be reorganised and pupils could go to St. Luke's in Barrhead or to some other Catholic secondary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to explore with the Minister the criteria that it is sensible and reasonable to use in these circumstances. St. Angela's and St. Louise's are both closer to St. Ninian's than is St. Cadoc's. Do the Government support the Eastwood principle, as enunciated by the Minister who represents that constituency? Referring to a proposal by Strathclyde regional council, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Eastwood principle—that pupils within Eastwood should be educated there—would be broken in a most disruptive way."</p></blockquote>
Do the Government give priority to the Eastwood principle—that whenever possible children should be educated within their own local authority—over other issues, such as proximity? St. Angela's and St. Louise's are physically closer to St. Ninian's than is St. Cadoc's. It is only the artificial boundary that makes it likely that they will be drafted out under the Minister's principle. If Eastwood—or East Renfrew as it will become—were expanded slightly to include St. Angela's and St. Louise's would the East Renfrew principle mean that pupils would be obliged to go to St. Ninian's? We want to know whether the Minister's view is also the Government's, and whether the idea of lebensraum—the territorial imperative of boundaries determining the location of people's education—is supported by the Government, because it has implications for other areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister clarify who will decide about St. Ninian's? Will East Renfrew or Glasgow decide, or will both decide? If they disagree, who will decide? If East Renfrewshire decided that it wanted to remove St. Angela's and St. Louise's, that would have capital implications for the City of Glasgow council, because it would have to make capital arrangements for Bellarmine or its successor. There is no guarantee that the capital would be available except at the expense of some other school within the City of Glasgow authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
East Renfrewshire may take a decision for logical reasons from its point of view but which would have consequences for the entire capital programme and the provision of Catholic education in Glasgow. How are those issues to be settled? Is it appropriate to pass them on to the Minister, and if so would he use the serious detriment clause to effect decisions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ask the Minister about the application of the Eastwood principle to east Dumbartonshire. The Pope
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0562">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1013</span>
John Paul II academy takes in youngsters from Glasgow and east Dumbartonshire. If the Eastwood principle were applied, Catholic youngsters—or any youngster in Glasgow—who wished to attend the Pope John Paul II academy, would, presumably, have priority. I know that many in St. Agnes's want to attend that school. The authority would recognise that priority by reorganising to give priority to youngsters from the city of Glasgow at the expense of those in east Dumbartonshire. That means that St. Joseph's and St. Andrew's primary schools are likely to be moved out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, the Secretary of State must tell us now or later whether he believes that the serious detriment rules would apply to any or all of those youngsters and whether he will allow Glasgow to take a decision that will affect east Dumbartonshire, or vice versa. It might be the case that those in east Dumbartonshire want to ask the Secretary of State for sufficient capital allocation to build a new Catholic secondary school somewhere in Bearsden and Milngavie. That could have a deleterious effect on the role of Pope John Paul II academy; it might, consequentially, lead to Glasgow, not unreasonably, wishing to close St. Augustine's. The knock-on effect, because the decision will be taken by two authorities, will not necessarily be rational as a whole, even though individual aspects of such a decision might in themselves appear rational on first examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My penultimate example is that of Addingstone grammar school. Three of its five feeder primaries are in a different authority. It would not be unreasonable for that authority—north Lanarkshire—to redivert pupils elsewhere because of the financial arguments of which I spoke earlier. They could be moved to Bellshill academy for example. That would increase loading on Bellshill and be more financially efficient, but clearly it would have a deleterious effect on Addingstone grammar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same issues have been discussed before in relation to who decides, and I look forward to the Minister's reply on the subject. The differences in this respect is that there is no opportunity for referral to the Secretary of State unless the school is 80 per cent. full. There is no provision for the serious deterioration rules to be applied in those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear, therefore, that in those situations one rule is applied for Catholic secondary and primary education and separate rule for non-denominational secondary and primary education. The Minister must spell out how he intends to provide equity between the two sectors, because there is a real fear that it will be seen that there is an additional level of appeal for the Catholic sector which does not exist for the non-denominational sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final example is that of Paisley grammar and Ralston primary. I am conscious that under the 80 per cent. rule, any moves in that respect would fall to be referred to the Minister, but it is not inevitable that the 80 per cent. rule will always apply. Therefore, any change which might take Ralston out of Paisley need not necessarily go to the Minister. If the Minister sup-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1014</span>
ports the Eastwood principle, as enunciated by the Minister with responsibility for education, his hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Eastwood, it would imply that Ralston primary youngsters have to be sent to Barrhead, so that more room could be made in Paisley grammar for west Renfrewshire youngsters from other parts of the authority. The Minister must spell out what rule he will apply. Is he prepared to disown the policy of his hon. Friend by saying that the Government do not allow the Eastwood principle to apply?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These serious issues have been taxing education, educationists and the educational community in Scotland for a considerable time. I hope that the Minister will give us some clear and categorical answers about how he intends the new procedure to operate. Otherwise, the furore that is building up in Scottish education and the concerns that are being expressed today and daily will continue and we shall be obliged to table further amendments and seek further clarification from the Minister on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to speak about three matters specific to the clause and the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take account of what has been said and recognise the importance to families of the provision of transport by the local authority responsible for it. It has been suggested that local transport arrangements will be put at great risk by the Bill and the implications of the change in authorities. It has also been suggested that all is right at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have corresponded recently with Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive and the education authority on the matter. Every member of the Committee is worried, particularly since the tragic accident in Biggar a few weeks ago involving pupils being transported to school. A young lad lost his life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On behalf of my constituents I have been chasing up the rules governing current transport arrangements. With a great deal of surprise, I received a letter from the transport executive that suggests to me that Strathclyde is not complying with existing legislation; perhaps it is doing nothing illegal, but it is not complying according to how the law is perceived to act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My understanding is that school transport systems allow three children per seat on coaches and on buses. That is fair, but any possibility of children standing is ruled out. The letter that I have received today from the school transport authority suggests that that is not the case in Strathclyde and that it is prepared to abandon the rule in some circumstances in which adults are carried on those particular coaches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
School children are being allowed to stand on school transport buses. That should worry every member of the Committee. I have written to the Minister about the matter, and have written to Strathclyde. I would like to think that current legislation is observed to the full. Authorities such as Strathclyde, which at present has a massive responsibility—the letter to me suggests it cannot cope with it—should be brought to heel now.

We should not wait until the more responsible and more locally oriented authorities are given responsibility for such matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Committee knows that the hon.

Where will it get its buses?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am speaking about education. The hon. Gentleman seems to be drifting off into the realms of some other debate. He is obviously not listening. I usually give way to the hon. Gentleman. If he intervenes again, I shall not hold his comments against him, but hope that he will intervene with something more relevant to the subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my intervention is relevant. I direct the hon. Gentleman's attention to the Minister's letter, which has been distributed to all members of the Committee and refers to the statutory duties relating to transport placed on local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Page 3, paragraph 4 of the letter states that if the number of pupils entitled to free transport exceeds the number of vacant places on a school bus, the authority must discriminate and decide which pupils would go on to the bus and which would not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does not that encourage authorities to allow children to stand on buses? Have not the Government created the legislative circumstances in which children have to stand on buses?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely not. Every authority must have responsibility first and foremost for the safety of the children within its remit. That specific comment in the letter did not refer to safety. It is responsibility of the local authority to look after the safety of the youngsters in its care. The contents of the letter from the transport executive are disgraceful. The local authority is not giving sufficient priority to safety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share the hon. Gentleman's concern about safety on buses. Does he agree that it would be increased by putting seat belts on school buses? However, it is estimated that it would cost £12 million to implement such safety measures. Where will that money come from when the Government have said that no new money will be provided?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must agree that if local authorities are not complying 100 per cent. with the principle and the letter of the law, what is the point of legislating further? Let them comply with the present law before we take it a step further.

The transport of youngsters receiving nursery education could be affected in the future. I wish to draw attention to comments that were made in the Committee on Tuesday evening when I intervened on the hon. Member for Dundee, East. I suggested that nursery education provision in Europe was provided at a
	<span class='label label-info column'>1016</span>
charge to the customers. The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley then said that I had made a statement that was not based on fact. The research department of the House of Commons has submitted a paper on the subject to me. I am sure that all hon. Members would recognise that it is neutral and would agree that it provides an excellent service. The paper states clearly that in Germany charges are made for nursery education. As usual, my comments are factual and they are not pulled out of the air. Labour Members would do well to take that on board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that all over Europe charges are made for nursery education. He has now said that Germany levies charges, but he has not given any evidence that other countries in Europe do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On Tuesday evening, I said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there is greater nursery provision in other countries in Europe because, unlike Scotland, they charge for nursery school services?"—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 8 March 1994; c. 988.]</p></blockquote>
That is one example, but there are others. It proves that the point I made was absolutely accurate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Transport will form part of the local scenario in future in the same way as the allocation of school boundaries and catchment areas. When the Bill is implemented, local knowledge and local interests will be taken into account when catchment areas are set.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to refer to comments made when I was discussing the issue of Castlehill school in my constituency, which Strathclyde has decided to close. As a consequence, the catchments for schools some distance away, such as Heathfield, are changing in a most irrational manner. That has happened because some councillors in Glasgow are taking decisions on local scenarios that they do not understand. Such a lack of knowledge leads to irrational comments and changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee told me that the decision of Strathclyde region to close Castlehill school was not made overnight, as I had stated. A letter to me of 9 March from the divisional education officer of Strathclyde demonstrates clearly that up to November 1992 Strathclyde regional council intended to provide a new school at Castlehill. Further consideration was given to the matter between then and January, when a statement was made that suggested that the closure of Castlehill was an option and would be the subject of consultation. That smacks to me of an overnight decision. I am prepared to make available that letter to other hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley appears to have done a runner again. Perhaps he is skulking in the Corridor, hoping to meet somebody who will give him points to raise in the debate.

school building. For a long time Strathclyde has been grossly underfunded because its permission to borrow has been refused far more than it should have been. The present rate of capital allocation in Strathclyde is sufficient to replace two of its 800 primary schools every year, which assumes that each primary school has to last 400 years. In those circumstances, the pattern across the region as a whole was to abandon new school building whenever possible so that schools in existence could keep going. There was simply insufficient capital to build new schools and maintain existing ones. That is why many new-build plans were abandoned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that and recognise the pressures in the management of budgets for which priorities must be set and plans made. A reasonable and well-managed local authority would ensure that plans are determined over a reasonable time scale. Periods of between three to five years would be reasonable for school closures and new school building. It is not reasonable, however, for a local authority to state that a building will be replaced and, at the 11th hour, to have achange of heart and to announce a closure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is rubbish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I shall place a copy of the letter on the Table so that the hon. Gentleman can determine for himself whether what I am saying is rubbish. The greatest rubbish heard on the airwaves here comes from the hon. Gentleman who constantly gives us a load of misinformation and absolute nonsense. It is about time that he improved his performance, instead of criticising other hon. Members.

I was out talking to the public relations officer for Scottish Power and telling him what a bad deal he is getting by paying so much money to the hon. Member for Ayr. The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is absolute nonsense. I did check in the first instance to see just how practical that option was.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am speaking to amendment No. 39 and those grouped with it. On education matters the Government have been clearly shown over the last few days to be beaten back to a stumbling position as demonstrated by the irrelevant and unconnected answers that the Minister gave at the end of our sitting Tuesday. 	<i>Hansard</i> will show that the answers had no relevance to the questions. The Government have been fumbling to keep the ball in the air that they are trying to do something for the people who will be penalised by the disaggregation of local government services. We have heard a lot of grumbling from the Minister, who clearly ahs been upstaged by my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton at every sitting of the Committee. It is clear that he does not like the fact that the press have reported the truth of the matter. The Government have no clothes to hide their shame at what they are doing to education as a result of their desire to split up local government boundaries in some silly political game.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendment No. 247 reveals all. It states that the boundaries and everything covered by the bill will remain
	<br><blockquote><p>"until they are changed by an education authority in accordance with this Act."</p></blockquote>
The Government clearly are trying to put a very thin layer of paper over the substantial cracks that will appear in Scottish education as a result of the Government's obsession with boundaries. The Minister, with his usual civility and courtesy, sent a letter to all members of the Committee. It was addressed and signed personally, using first names, a familiarity that some hon. Members may not like. The penultimate paragraph of that letter states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"These new provisions, added to the provisions which were already in the Bill, will ensure greater stability in the provision of education following re-organisation."</p></blockquote>
That sounds fine, but it continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"However, I should make it clear that we are not seeking to entrench the existing catchment areas for ever. It would be a nonsense to require an authority"—</p></blockquote>
the word "require" is underlined—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to educate its pupils in another authority's schools."</p></blockquote>
That reveals everything. It will not be necessary to require one authority to educate pupils in its catchment area in another area's schools. That makes total sense. If one is going to disaggregate local government one cannot say at the same time, "You have free choice but we'll continue to intervene." The Bill will mean that the final appeal will be to the Secretary of State. That is the purpose of new clause 5. According to the Minister's letter, the Secretary of State would be required to decide if a proposal for a change in catchment areas would result
	<span class='label label-info column'>1020</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"in a significant deterioration in the distribution and provision of school education in denominational schools compared to other schools managed by the authority."</p></blockquote>
Further clarification has made it clear that that covers every school, not just denominational schools. What is meant by "serious deterioration"? I have looked at St. Modan's high school in Central region, which shows the problem up very clearly. The Committee has discussed that school before. It is in Stirling and 60 per cent. of its pupils come from outwith the catchment of the Stirling unitary authority proposed by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have brought Ordnance Survey Routemaster map sheet four, which is on a scale of 1:250,000. Many motorists use this map, which shows clearly that the town of Stirling, and thus St. Modan's school, is further away from Denny than is St. Mungo's school in Falkirk. That is interesting, because the largest number of pupils who might attend St. Modan's from another authority—whether it be a unitary Falkirk authority or a Falkirk-Clackmannan authority—will come from Denny. The distance between Denny and St. Modan's along the A872 is greater by three or even five miles than is the distance along the A803 between Denny and St. Mungo's in Falkirk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After a few years it will make no sense for parents, pupils and the authority in Falkirk district if people do not move across the boundaries. The problem is real. I received some correspondence from my former geography teacher, who is now head teacher of St. Modan's. He points out that 299 out of 838 pupils—that is, 35 per cent.—currently come from the Denny area in Falkirk district. As the Queen's counsel for the Catholic Education Commission said, there will be no immediate effect. No assurance is offered in new clause 5 or in the Minister's letter. In the fullness of time, which may be in just a few years, there may be boundary changes and catchment area changes and St. Modan's may lose pupils. The same could apply to Clackmannan, but I shall not argue the same case twice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Govan expressed the argument about average costs well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not. That has nothing to do with what I am saying. The Minister is grumbling. He must have a digestion problem because this morning—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member is not giving way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin. There have been many diversions this morning, some of which have

	<span class='label label-info column'>1021</span>
had nothing to do with good English, good poetry or the good workings of the Scottish education system. I think that we have had enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider average costs in Central region. For 299 pupils, the average cost is £1,602 per pupil for education. What will it be if pupils from St. Modan's come from Falkirk? Will the charge be 299 x £1,602 or will it be 299 x the average cost per pupil in Stirling? Will that be £2,000 or £3,000? As I shall show later, the costs in Stirling are much greater.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must ask why Falkirk taxpayers should pay less than the taxpayers of the Stirling unitary authority for education, or vice-versa; why should the disparity be allowed to arise? What will the Government do about it? Will they subsidise the Stirling taxpayers to bring costs down to the average that would exist in Falkirk?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 9 is important and gives a far-reaching commitment. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State shall give full regard to all related expenses incurred in respect of the provision of education as a result of the provisions in this Act".</p></blockquote>
It also refers to transport. I draw attention to the word "all". Disaggregating regions costs money and that cost reveals the stupidity of the government's approach in general and especially to education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the region that I know best, the capital allocated for education is £5.6 million. Let us consider the disaggregated sums for the new unitary authorities. For all services, Falkirk would have £7 million that is not currently committed to projects and Stirling would have £3 million. There is no chance of such an authority being able to meet its education provision. As may hon. Friend the Member for Govan pointed out, it would be in a similar situation to that in Strathclyde. It would be unable to cope with the costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The community use of educational facilities currently accounts for 1,350 hours. That costs Central region £750,000. After disaggregation, small authorities such as Stirling or a small Clackmannan authority—should the Minister completely take leave of his senses and push for it to protect Stirling for the Minister of State at the Department of Employment, his hon. Friend the Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth)—will be unable even to carry out that simple function.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not take give way. The Minister should sit and listen rather than talk to his hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[SIR JAMES KILFEDDER 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>The Government's two-council option would result in two sets of administration. That would mean either cuts in service or more costs. It is not possible to have two administrations and management, especially for education, without incurring costs. The calculation is
	<span class='label label-info column'>1022</span>
that pro rata costs in secondary education in a Stirling unitary authority would add £1,059,000 to the cost of secondary education in Central. For primary education, the additional cost would be £800,000. As I said, the average costs for a primary school pupil are £1,602 in Central.</p>
	<p>Let us consider the costs of the schools in the Stirling area, which is very sparse. Crainlarich's average cost per pupil is £3,277. In the Trossachs school, where the head teacher is the wife of a former Trossachs Conservative councillor, it is £3,666. At Arnprior it is £5,858 and at Inversnaid it is £4,641. That is the difference in cost with a disaggregated, stand-alone unitary authority. A secondary school costs £14 million. The Minister has churlishly refused permission for the building of a secondary school in the Braes in my constituency. The Falkirk section of my constituency has no secondary school. Everyone has to travel to the town of Falkirk.</p>
	<p>To refurbish a school costs £4 million and building a primary school comes to £1 million minimum. The cost of Falkirk high school refurbishment, because of the minister's refusal, will be £3.2 million. The cost for Graham high will be £4 million, Larbert high £5 million, there is nothing at the moment for Woodlands in Falkirk or for Bo'ness, which is almost in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow.</p>
	<p>The Bo'ness experience should be considered. When the last disaggregation occurred and West Lothian went out of existence to be replaced by the new Central authority, Bo'ness was moved from West Lothian into Central. If the Minister takes the trouble to visit, he will see the large field where the extension to Bo'ness academy was to be built by West Lothian. Of course when the authority realised that it was getting shot of Bo'ness that was not carried out. There is now now assembly hall and no facility for holding exams in one place. That is all because of the cost of disaggregation. According to the Government, new clause 9 states that they will bear the expenses of that.</p>
	<p>It is worth examining the experience of Clackmannan, the wee, under-resourced county. We have heard some talk about enabling authorities. For that area, since 1974, there have been major works at Alloa academy, Fishcross primary and Tillicoultry. The regional council has had to build new primaries at Menstrie, at Tulliboddy, at Sauchie and at Alloa. Disaggregation and boundary changes—particularly where small authorities are concerned—require money to be found from other places.</p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nursery education expenditure in Central is £2.7 million for 3,068 pupils.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not. I want the Minister to consider a simple example. The school library service can be split on a population basis. [HON. MEMBERS: "Give way".] I have sat through most of the day watching time being wasted by the Minister and by other hon. Members in busking and not getting down to the facts. Let us stick to the facts. If the Minister wants to talk about them later I am willing to listen to him, as I did all day Tuesday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is an important subject. The Government have committed themselves to fully regarding the additional costs of the Act. If the school library service was disaggregated on a population basis there would be 5.4 school librarians available for Stirling, which has seven secondary schools. If disaggregation was based on the local tax base, there would be fewer than five librarians for seven schools. Will the Government provide extra money for two librarians in that simple way?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been told that enabling authorities and contracting out will save lots of money. Let us look at the deficiencies in that and at why the Government will have to face additional costs under new clause 9 if they are serious. There would be added costs in setting up a supply to cater for the demand. There are no private or voluntary markets now available for most of the services that the enabling authorities claim that they will look for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the local authorities are the suppliers—if the aspiration is that the suppliers will be other local authorities—is there any reasonable expectations that any local authority has more capacity than it needs in relation to special education, for example? Every piece of evidence suggests that we need more resources to cope with the demands in the education authorities' areas, and I do not think that there will be any capacity additions. They will have to find those by paying additional sums for them.

My final point concerns the additional distance from the provider to the community. There is an aspiration that Stirling might twin up with Perth. The hon. Member for Tayside, North is not here, otherwise he could probably confirm that meetings are taking place about it. It will be 58 miles from the secondary school in Balfron to Perth, where they may get those services designed and delivered. It is 52 miles from Crianlarich. But if it is a Clackmannan-Fife link should Clackmannan stand alone, they would have to go to Glenrothes, and the distance from Alva to Glenrothes is more than 30 miles.

The real cost of this will fall on the shoulders of the parents and the children who need their education. New clause 9 says that the Government should have regard to those costs. Will the Minister give us some guarantees that the costs that he will have regard to, in cash terms, will be met in full? He may wish to explain
	<span class='label label-info column'>1024</span>
how he will deal with the cost in the loss of service, loss of locality and loss of confidence that will result from the Government's break-up of catchment areas by silly, politically motivated boundary changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister regards that there is understandable concern about the consequences of the boundaries crossing existing catchment areas. What consultation took place with the schools and the education authorities affected when the Government drew up the local authority boundary changes? What consultation did the Government undertake when they drew up their boundary maps regarding catchment areas and school transport across such boundaries? Do the Government even know how many schools and how many pupils are involved nationally? What estimates do they have for costs incurred by authorities if children in their area are pupils in other local authority areas? Is that burden sustainable in the future by the local authorities involved?

The hon. Member for Govan described an incredible situation this morning. The Scottish education department does not know where Scottish school catchment areas are. That is an incredible admission from the people who are supposed to be in charge of the education system in Scotland. Schools and their catchment areas did not appear magically overnight—they have existed for decades. The Government should have had that information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: School catchment areas tend to change at regular intervals. Unless local authorities pass on information, it is impossible for the Scottish Office to keep on top of things. I can give the Committee an example. I referred earlier to Heathfield school where the changes were announced just last month. I am sure that that information has not been passed on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: School catchment areas may change regularly all over the country in individual circumstances, but those will be the exception. The reality is that the pattern across Scotland is pretty well established. If the people in charge of the Scottish education system do not know, that shows the sort of chaos that exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation has nothing to do with COSLA and any non-co-operation—it has everything to do with the Government blundering into reorganisation without knowing the consequences. They have imposed their map on the existing situation without consultation. Now they admit that they do not know the effects of their policy on individual circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will be aware of the circumstances in Tayside, especially as they affect Moniefieth high school. Is he suggesting that somehow the boundary changes, which I know that Angus district council supports, should not be implemented because problems regarding Monifieth high school must be resolved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is trying to be disingenuous. I draw his attention to the problems that the Government have created. I want answers to the genuine anxieties of parents in Monifieth high school and in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0568">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1025</span>
Birkhill primary school and the other schools throughout Scotland that are affected by the changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government chose to impose these boundaries; they did not consult and they have not thought through the consequences of their policy. Those are all signs of an ill-thought-out, rushed measure. If the Government had taken time and consulted, many of the problems would have been resolved and parents' genuine anxieties would have been allayed. But that is not how the Government operate; they are rushing the Bill through Parliament. If Wheatley had been around now, these problems would have been thought about and resolved, not after the event but before the Government set their policy in tablets of stone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Edinburgh is a rather talkative city and the talk there is that the civil service was told not to involve itself in boundary decisions, which were left to Mr. Alan Young, the Secretary of State's highly political adviser, and to the politicians of whom the Secretary of State was the leading member. When the Minister replies, I shall ask whether that is true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. I hope that he will get a reply from the Minister. The Government have much to answer for if what was said is true. I hope that the Minister will clearly state what consultation took place and what advice he received from local authorities when he imposed his arbitrary map on Scottish education. As the hon. Gentleman said, the Minister should tell us what advice he received on this matter from civil servants and others. Those points must be clarified, given the importance of education to Scotland's economic and social future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the Government, present pupils will not be affected by the changes, but parents are worried about what will happen to future pupils. The answer to parents' questions will affect not only individual pupils and their families but also school roles and the range of subjects available. Those wider effects are inbuilt in the Government's proposals. That is what is really worrying the parents of pupils at the schools involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government claim that the Bill merely updates existing legislation and say that it is no big deal. But it is. There is a fear that the Government's reassuring noises are simply a ploy to tide them over the immediate short-term reaction to the measure but the problems exist and will be borne by pupils and teachers after the Bill becomes law, when it cannot be changed. The Government must consider the serious anxieties of parents at the schools affected by the measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the Government's safeguards is what they call a consultation process, which will include parents, school boards and the relevant church authorities, when appropriate. Will the Minister clarify what form the consultation will take? We have had enough of Government consultation which is anything but that. How will the consultation mentioned in the Bill be organised? What will happen when there is no consensus or agreement? Who will finally decide? The Minister states that there are certain circumstances in which
	<span class='label label-info column'>1026</span>
the Secretary of State's consent to school reorganisation will be required. Will he clarify, for the record, exactly what is meant by certain circumstances?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parents' worries were expressed in a letter to the Secretary of State from Birkhill primary school board. Its public meeting last week was attended by 100 people, an exceptional number for such a small village. The letter states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"this Bill may have far-reaching effects for the secondary education of the children who attend, and who will attend, Birkhill primary school, as they would no longer be within the catchment areas for schools within Dundee, at the most five miles from here. They would therefore have to travel to schools possibly as far as 16 miles away. The Board realises that the Bill itself will not effect a change to school catchment areas, and that councils will only be able to change these, as at present, after consultation with parents, school boards and other interested parties."</p></blockquote>
The board wants to go beyond that. It
	<br><blockquote><p>"believes that it would be wise to be prepared, and to consider what may happen in the future should the current links with our local secondary schools be broken."</p></blockquote>
The letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Board is not decrying educational standards at any school. Children will find their own academic level anywhere. We are concerned at what might happen outside the classroom, not inside it."</p></blockquote>
I would like the Minister to address those problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The board's letter adds:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The rural schools in this area which feed to Dundee secondaries are in one cluster group, with teachers from primary and secondary schools meeting regularly, and visiting other schools to exchange ideas and information. This is obviously easier because of the relative closeness to the secondary schools. Continuity of education, as recommended by the Government's 5–14 Programme, will be easier and probably more effective if primary schools continue to feed neighbouring secondary schools.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The most obvious disadvantage is the travelling required. A daily 32 mile round trip could be involved, or, put another way, 6,400 miles per year, on busy roads, in a school bus without seat belts."</p></blockquote>
Those problems should be addressed by the Government because the parents are worried.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no easy public transport alternative if a pupil misses the school bus. The board writes that although some extra-curricular activities take place at lunchtime, the majority take place after 4 pm or in the evening because of their nature and the time involved. The letter states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Children travelling distances will suffer discrimination. They will have no chance to participate. How many parents would be able to drive to Forfar for 5 pm to meet a child after football practice or orchestra rehearsal?"</p></blockquote>
The Bill may force such practical, everyday problems on to parents and pupils where boundaries cross catchment areas. What specific assurances can the Minister give to such parents, whose worries typify those being felt in every school affected by the Government's proposals?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment provides for the retention of existing rights and would prevent the potential damage that would be caused by the Government's ill-thought-out and unilateral map making. I support the amendment
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0569">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1027</span>
for those reasons and hope that the Minister will deal with the worries that have been expressed on behalf of parents from schools that will be affected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make only a brief contribution because some matters that I wanted to discuss have been dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the boundary changes as they affect my constituency and neighbouring constituencies. I realise that the changes have given rise to fears about future education provision. It may surprise the hon. Member for Dundee, East to learn that the chief executive of Tayside region and the director of education have been able, following consultations, to resolve the school transport problems with which I have been involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Problems usually have arisen because individuals wanted to send their children to schools of their choosing under the parents charter. They have done so, which has put question marks over transportation. The problem of transport costs arise when parents make a choice. Thus far, there have been only isolated examples of problems not being resolved. I understand the technical reasons for that. Solutions have largely been found.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter that my hon. Friend the Minister sent this morning to every member of the Committee makes it clear that when there are vacant seats on the transport provided, youngsters who do not live within the area can have the seats. That is the system that Tayside has used successfully. That is important because some schools, including the one at Newtyle in my constituency, are concerned about the future. The children in Newtyle go to Harris academy in Dundee and want to continue to go there. The assurances that my hon. Friend the Minister gave me lead me to believe that problems will not arise. Children will continue to attend Harris academy and their younger siblings will also be able to go. I am pleased about that and have conveyed the information to the headmaster and parents of pupils at Newtyle school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to the letter distributed to every member of the Committee this morning. It explains that section 1 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 places a duty on each education authority to secure adequate and efficient provision of school education for its area. That means that each authority will have to secure for its own area—the only area that it controls—secondary schools with the requisite primary catchment areas attached to them. Therefore, the new Dundee authority will have to alter the existing catchment areas of the secondary schools for which it is responsible to contain all the primary schools within its area. That means that Dundee authority will have to leave out primary schools that are outwith the area, such as at Newtyle, Invergowrie and Monifieth. By definition, changes in the catchment area will have to occur if the councils have to meet the statutory duty placed on them by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I anticipate that, over time, there will be change. I have lived in Dundee much longer than the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1028</span>
hon. Gentleman has and I remember when Dundee was an authority in its own right and had its own education authority. Morgan, Grove and Harris academies were popular schools and people travelled from outlying areas to them. For example, people travelled regularly from Tealing to Morgan academy and from Longforgan and Invergowrie to Harris academy. Under the old system, the necessary arrangements were made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we had the present local government structures and boundaries, the magnet, quality schools that people wanted to send their children to were available outside the catchment areas. I expect that change will take place, but schools of excellence will continue to have such reputations and act as magnets. I have no doubt that suitable arrangements will be made, particularly as my hon. Friend the Minister said that money will follow the children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to respond. Several important points have been raised this morning. The hon. Member for Govan discussed the 28-day period allowed in the regulations for consultation with parents and school boards on proposals for changes in catchment areas. He suggested that the period of time was not long enough and asked whether we would consider extending it. He will know that the regulations governing the length of the consultation period—for the extensive consultation that authorities must carry out if they wish to propose changes to the catchment areas—were prepared following detailed consideration of all relevant factors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be happy to consider the representations made. I have had similar representations from the Roman Catholic hierarchy and issue of the consultation period was raised at the meeting between the Secretary of State, Archbishop Winning, the Catholic Education Commission and myself. I shall be happy to study the matter further and to consult with authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Govan also touched upon the 80 per cent. rule. I am aware that in Strathclyde some schools do not have a formal geographical catchment area. Instead, admission arrangements are based on pupils coming from their associated primaries. There is some doubt as to whether those schools will be caught by the safeguard of the 80 per cent. rule. I have considered the matter and I undertake to bring forward an amendment to the regulations to make sure that those schools are definitely caught by the 80 per cent. rule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Angus, East and for Govan raised the issue of the location of schools in relation to new local authority boundaries. The Scottish Office Education Department holds a complete list of primary and secondary schools and their addresses. What is not held centrally is an indication of the new local authorities in which all of those addresses fall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That information could readily be provided by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities or by individual authorities, but, so far, they are refusing to assist. That leaves the Department with the only option of studying a street map for the address of every school so that we can identify its precise geographical location in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0570">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1029</span>
relation to the new boundaries. If necessary, that will have to be done, but it will be a major task—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for East Lothian may laugh, but it is an important task because there are 2,350 primary schools and more than 400 secondary schools in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would make much more sense and save considerable administrative effort for that information to be made available by those who already hold it. That is a matter of straightforward co-operation. I do not see any reason why that information should not be provided. Hon. Members should use their good offices to encourage local authorities to come forward with the information and to make it readily available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that he knows where the schools and the catchment areas are and that he has drawn up a map, but that he cannot link the two? He has drawn up a map without being aware of its consequences. That is incredible. It is Government paralysis. If the Minister knows where the schools are and if he has decided on the boundaries surely he can match the two.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is perfectly possible to ensure that that job is done by the Scottish Office. Those facts are readily available however, in the authorities involved. I see no reason why they should seek to prevent the Scottish Office from having that information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not the case that local authorities have responsibility for the provision of education services and the way that they are operated in local areas? Is it not a fact that Opposition Members are suggesting a duplication of effort with the costly involvement of civil servants? Is that not typical of Opposition Members, who always shout for more money, but never examine the way in which it is spent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree absolutely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have considered a range of issues and factors in drawing up the local authority boundaries, including the 3,000 responses to the second consultation paper. Of course, there were different and sometimes conflicting arguments, for particular boundaries, some involving educations issues and others involving all types of Factors. We are not in a position to take into account specific catchment areas because COSLA was not prepared to supply the most up-to-date details of them. Nevertheless, I have made it clear that the education provisions in the Bill take account of catchment areas and will ensure the maximum stability consistent with the boundary changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister refers to all types of issues, so may I ask a factual question? When the final decisions were made was Mr. Alan Young present?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been present at discussions with civil servants and the Secretary of State about boundaries. Mr. Young may well have been present. It is for Parliament to decide. These matters
	<span class='label label-info column'>1030</span>
have been discussed fully. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood has listened to many representations and met many deputations. He has responded to a great many of the points that have been raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the answer to the question "yes"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is wrong in the inference he drew in his original question. He was suggesting that it was not the decision of the Secretary of State and Ministers to put forward the proposal. It was their decision based on the best advice of the civil servants. It was then put before Parliament, it is for Parliament to decide ultimately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me clarify that the boundaries were drawn up on the advice of civil servants. Is that what the Committee is to believe?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The boundaries were suggested after a large number of different views had been put from a large number of sources. The civil servants gave their advice on those recommendations. It is, ultimately, for Parliament itself to decide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I have covered the point. The hon. Member can make his own speech in his own way at a later stage. I wish to confirm that section 23(2) of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 covers the circumstances raised earlier by the hon. Member for Govan. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where an education authority … have provided school education … for any pupil belonging to the area of some other authority, that education authority … may … recover from that other authority such contributions … as may be determined by the Secretary of State, who shall have regard to the estimated cost of such provision".</p></blockquote>
That is an important safeguard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Govan asked about St Ninian's school. I have seen a deputation on that matter which was also attended by the Under-Secretary, and by the hon. Members for Glasgow, Pollock (Mr. Dunnachie) and for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall). St Ninian's is over 80 per cent. full. Any proposal to change the catchment areas would have to be referred automatically to the Secretary of State for his consent after the fullest consultation. He would have to consider all relevant factors before reaching a view. The whole point of clause 32 is to enable authorities to maintain or to enter into cross-border arrangements. St Ninian's could also be referred to the Secretary of State under the provisions relating to significant deterioration. That is another matter that the Secretary of State would have to consider in relation to all the facts and circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Govan also made the point about capital allocations. With a popular school that is more than 80 per cent. full and where there is a demand for more pupils than the school can hold there may well be a case for building on to that school if that is possible. That is the kind of circumstance which should be considered in the case of such a popular school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>1031</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that sooner or later the new councils will change the catchment areas for which they are responsible in order to align the primary schools with the secondary schools in their area? Does he also accept that it is reasonable for the new councils to do that? In those circumstances would the Secretary of State try to prevent that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see no reason why authorities should automatically seek to change catchment areas. There may be shifts in population, which must be taken into account or there may be a case for rationalisation. Before any changes can take place, however, there must be the most widespread consultation with interested parties. Under the 80 per cent. rule it is not just the school itself that is involved but all other feeder schools which could suffer from a knock-on effect. The Secretary of State would have to take into account all the relevant facts and circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has spoken about the knock-on effects in a catchment area. Has he also thought of the knock-on effect of a school opting out of local authority control? The implications would be far more serious and could be devastating for certain schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has raised a different issue that is governed by different legislation. Before the Secretary of State approves self-governing schools he must examine all the facts and circumstances very carefully. He receives a full report from the inspectorate. What has been made clear is that self-governing schools are not established where there is a strong case for rationalisation in the area concerned.

My hon. Friend the Member for Ayr raised the important issue of safety on school buses. I agree that the matter should be given top priority. I made a point of seeing my hon. Friend the Minister for Roads and Traffic at the Department of Transport yesterday to give him all the evidence from Scotland so that it was properly taken into account after the tragedy at Biggar. The Department of Transport is undertaking a review of the full technical and cost implications of the proposal to make compulsory the fitting of seatbelts to all forward-facing seat positions in minibuses and coaches. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport will be considering a report on school transport safety. I do not wish to anticipate what action might be necessary as a result of that report's findings. However, the Committee can be assured that everything possible will be done to ensure that school transport is as safe as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, in a moment. My hon. Friend the Member for Ayr asked whether Strathclyde might be infringing safety legislation by allowing children to stand on school buses. The legislation relating to safety is the responsibility of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport. As I said, I met the Minister for Roads and Traffic yesterday, and I can assure my hon. Friend that all the relevant issues are under consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present statutory position is that Strathclyde provides transport for children under eight who live two miles or more from the school, and for children of eight or over who live three miles or more from the school. Strathclyde operates according to the statute but, like other authorities, I understand that it chooses to provide transport more widely for children aged under eight living more than one mile from the school, and for children aged eight and over living more than two miles from the school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to return to the question of safety on school buses. As well as the accident at Biggar, a boy from Drongan in my constituency was killed on his way to Auchinleck academy. The Minister spoke about seatbelts, but there are a couple of other aspects to the problem which I hope that he raised with the Minister for Roads and Traffic yesterday. At present, three pupils—even large ones—are expected to sit on seats designed for two. That creates tremendous problems and obliges some pupils to stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there are no attendants on school buses because of financial cuts. As a result there is a lot of disruption on those buses. That again causes danger to schoolchildren. Will those two additional matters be examined and mentioned in the report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did discuss with the Minister the point about three pupils to a seat, but the other matter needs to be resolved by the relevant regional council, to which the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a straightforward one. Everyone is worried about safety on school transport. One estimate suggests that safe school transport will cost about £12 million. Where will that money come from? Will it be new money, or will it come from the existing budget? That is a fair question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must appreciate that the review covered the precise issue of costs and is in the process of being studied. I discussed that yesterday with the Minister involved. The lead is provided by my hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This group of amendments has brought together a range of topics and I hope that the Committee will regard it as helpful if I deal with the various topics in groups. First, I shall discuss amendment No. 39, new clause 14 and Government amendment No. 247 as one group. Secondly, I shall consider new clause 5 and safeguards for Roman Catholic education. Thirdly, I shall deal with Government new clause 6, and new clauses 9 and 16.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the first group, amendment No. 39 would require authorities to retain existing school catchment areas after local government reform. We cannot agree to that. Authorities cannot and should not be fettered in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 32, as clarified by Government amendment No. 247, will make it clear that existing school admission arrangements with cross-boundary effect can continue until changed by the normal statutory procedures. That will enable education authorities to make cross-boundary arrangements in future. It is right that they should be able to do so when that is required by local needs and local circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot possibly constrain authorities' options in the way that amendment No. 39 proposes. The existing education legislation does not limit authorities' ability to propose changes in school provision and there is no reason why limits should be placed on the new authorities. When changes are proposed, the usual consulations will have to be carried out and certain categories of proposals referred to my right hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 14 is not appropriate or necessary. Nothing in the Bill requires authorities to change school catchment areas or associated primary school arrangements as a consequence of local government reform. Indeed, clause 32 specifically enables such existing admission arrangements, including catchment areas, to remain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing in the Bill authorises education authorities to change catchment areas without going through the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1034</span>
normal statutory procedures. It is likely that the new authorities will wish to review their school provision, in some cases jointly with neighbouring authorities. If they wish to propose changes in school admission arrangements, whether for reasons connected with new boundaries or for any other reasons, they will have to follow the usual consultation process under the statutory requirements and to seek the consent of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State when the statute or regulations require it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of new clause 14 is also not entirely clear. If its intention is simply to preserve existing catchment areas and associated primary school arrangements unless changed by appropriate procedures, it is unnecessary, as clause 32 already does that. If it is intended to go further, and prevent any alignment of catchment areas to new boundaries, it goes too far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How can the Minister expect to be taken seriously in saying that the Secretary of State will be the final arbiter on school boundaries, when he has admitted already to the Committee and, in a written reply, to the House, that he does not know where the schools are? Ministers should surely go back to basics and discover where the schools are before making decisions on local authority boundaries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was obviously not listening. If he reads 	<i>Hansard</i> he will see that I made it quite clear that we know exactly where the schools are, but we should appreciate authorities producing the information that they possess. That would be of great assistance to everyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Authorities cannot and should not be fettered from adjusting catchment areas in appropriate cases, for example to carry out necessary and desirable rationalisation or reorganisation. This is an area in which they must be allowed due discretion subject to the need under existing legislation for certain categories of school reorganisation proposals to be referred to my right hon. Friend for consent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against this background, let me turn to amendment No. 247. In turn, it should be set against what clause 32 already achieves. Clause 32 strengthens the powers of education authorities in relation to cross-boundary school admission arrangements. It achieves this by inserting new subsections into section 23 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980. The intention of new subsection (1C) is to preserve the competence of school admission arrangements already in place at the time of local government reorganisation but which, as a consequence of new boundaries, lead to pupils belonging to the area of one education authority being educated at a school under the management of another education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wording at present could be misconstrued as entrenching such arrangements for all time. I know that this might suit some parents and others who are concerned that there is going to be wholesale revision of school catchment areas because of local government reform. As I have said before, however there is no reason why there should be such changes merely as a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0573">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1035</span>
consequence of reorganisation. In any case, the current legislation, together with the amendments which we have proposed, offers substantial protection to parents. More importantly, of course, and as I am sure hon. Members would agree, it would be utterly wrong to entrench existing catchment areas for all time. It must be within the power of the new education authorities to come forward with proposals for rationalisation or reorganisation where they think this is necessary. This amendment simply puts beyond doubt that existing school catchment areas can continue post-reform until an education authority is minded to change them. Where such changes are proposed, of course, authorities will have to carry out the usual consultations—and obtain the consent of the Secretary of State where that is required—in accordance with sections 22A to 22D of the 1980 Act and the associated regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 5 implements—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has explained clearly that he thinks that authorities will change catchment areas only if they have good reason to do so. Would not a good reason to do so be the case of Dundee, for example? If a large number of pupils within the council area were to attend schools in another authority, the rate support grant would be reduced as a result and the authority's ability to provide education for the rest of the children in that area would be seriously impaired.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can confirm that that will not happen. Grant-aided expenditure is allocated on the basis of where children are educated, but for other costs, special school teachers for example, the allocation is based on where the children live. Let me give the hon. Gentleman an example of pupils' cross-border movements. Let us suppose that a pupil lives in authority A but goes to school in authority B. In that case, authority A would receive grant-aided expenditure and consequently the support in relation to the pupil concerned for the cost of schooling would fall on Authority B. Local authorities necessarily make arrangements for inter-authority payments in such circumstances. As I said earlier, in the event of disagreement, the Secretary of State has the power to arbitrate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that if the grant follows the pupil, in circumstances in which an authority loses half a secondary school of pupils to another authority, thereby leaving the secondary school in its area half empty, a substantial cost falls on the authority that the pupils have left because it operates at a far lower loading percentage? That means that the cost per pupil would be far higher. It would be financially sensible for that authority to seek to have those pupils transferred back to it by re-zoning the area. There is, therefore, financial pressure on the authority losing pupils to transfer them back.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The methodology by which the funds are made available is agreed with the distribution committee of the working party on local government finance. We envisage maximum continuity in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In new clause 5 we clarify the arrangements under which the proposed changes affecting denominational
	<span class='label label-info column'>1036</span>
schools would require to be referred to the Secretary of State for Scotland for his consent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parents have expressed concern in case the catchment areas are changed. They will remain as they are, unless and until the new authorities seek to introduce change. The authorities will be required by law to carry out extensive consultation first with the parents and school boards involved. In the case of denominational schools, such consultation will be with the Roman Catholic hierarchy or the denominational body, as appropriate. As at present, the Secretary of State's consent will be required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the existing provisions under which such consent is required is section 22D of the 1980 Act, which relates to denominational schools. Under this section, a proposal to make a significant change in relation to such a school, including any changes to the school's catchment area, must come to the Secretary of State for consent in certain circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of whether a proposal requires consent under this section and, if so, consideration of the proposal by the Secretary of State, involves the application of a key test—namely, whether the Secretary of State is satisfied that it would result in a significant deterioration in the distribution and provision of school education in denominational schools, compared with that in other schools managed by the education authority. Because section 22D refers to schools managed by the education authority, it is not clear that it would apply when more than one education authority was involved. The new clause ensures that that is the case. The test that the Secretary of State will apply will be one of significant deterioration, not just for pupils belonging to the area of the education authority making the proposal, but for those belonging to the area of any other education authority or, for that matter, for those in two or more such authorities taken together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the question of deterioration, what certain circumstances—the word was used in the plural—does the Minister have in mind that will require the Secretary of State's involvement in such a decision?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will depend entirely on the facts and circumstances of the case. [	<i>Laughter.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What are they?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note a considerable amount of merriment on this. It is exactly the same as the test for what is reasonable. We had a very substantial debate the other night to define "reasonable". No doubt the hon. Gentleman has his own definition. These matters refer to the facts and circumstances of the case. It is an extremely important safeguard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has failed to answer the most direct and fundamental question on this aspect. Nevertheless, can I ask him whether he sees any problem in the changed situation when there will be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0574">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1037</span>
no equity of treatment for denominational and non-denominational schools in connection with catchment areas that cross new council boundaries?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising that point. The debate has clearly moved on. The position of Roman Catholic education is strongly safeguarded. The hon. Gentleman asks why those safeguards are not applied everywhere else. Quite simply, all schools are covered by the 80 per cent. rule. When we introduced it to protect Paisley grammar, the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) spoke very critically about it from the Labour Front Bench, but that rule was a safeguard for all schools. When schools are less than 80 per cent. full, the placing request legislation comes into play and parents are entitled to ensure that their children are educated at those schools. The problem will not arise, so the position is covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will try to satisfy the Committee that new clause 9 is unnecessary. There is already a statutory obligation on my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to consult COSLA on local government finance matters. He meets the convention's office bearers three times a year—there is elaborate machinery for consultation. COSLA used that machinery to bring to my right hon. Friend's attention the cost pressures which it believes that local authorities will face in the year ahead and which should be taken into account. I have no doubt that COSLA will raise any matters involving additional costs to the education service which it believes arise from the Bill. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will naturally give the fullest consideration to its views. The proposed new clause is unnecessary, given the machinery that already exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can also assure hon. Members that new clause 16 is unnecessary. New clause 6 achieves the purpose for which that amendment appears to be intended and does so more effectively. New clause 6 removes any doubt about whether an education authority would still have a duty under section 51 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 in respect of pupils from its area who attend a school which, as a result of a boundary change, becomes managed by another authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As drafted, new clause 16 is vague and it is not at all clear what it would achieve. I hope that the Committee will agree that it is not appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to new clause 6, we have listened carefully to the concerns about school transport expressed by the Roman Catholic hierarchy, my hon. Friends and others. The new clause seeks to meet fully the range of school transport concerns that has been raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 6 clarifies the duty and power of new education authorities in relation to school transport. Many of the representations on this subject have given rise to doubt about whether section 51 of the 1980 Act makes it clear beyond doubt that a new authority would still have a duty in respect of pupils from its own area who attend a school which, as a result of a boundary change, becomes managed by another authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We took the view that, in recognition of the concerns expressed by the Roman Catholic Church in particular,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1038</span>
with whom we had amicable discussions, an amendment to section 51 was necessary for the avoidance of any doubt about whether the duty of an authority would apply in the circumstances which I have described. I welcome the positive response of the Roman Catholic Church.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What undertakings have been given about money and resources for this provision? Is there a clear understanding that resources will be made available for the extra spending that authorities will be obliged to undertake?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Cross-boundary transport costs are now funded by agreement between authorities. They are empowered to do that under section 23 of the 1980 Act. Whether those arrangements continue after reorganisation or whether the costs are taken formally into account in the distribution of revenue support, will be a matter for discussion between the Department, authorities and COSLA. The hon. Gentleman makes a legitimate point and I shall ensure that the costs are properly taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What does the Minister mean when he says that the costs will be "properly taken into account"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask hon. Members to listen carefully to what the Minister says. I want to hear what he has to say. He is not giving way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask the Minister again to give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister has made it clear that he is not giving way, so the hon. Member must sit down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a senior Member of the House, I have not spoken at length this morning, and I ask the Minister to give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If the Minister does not give way, the person trying to intervene must regain his seat. The hon. Member is a leading and distinguished Member, but the rules apply and if a speaker does not give way, the hon Member trying to intervene must sit down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask the Minister again to give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will be free to make a speech on this matter at the termination of my remarks and I shall respond to him fully. I have made it clear that the issues will be properly taken into account in our discussions with the COSLA finance working group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many practical examples of the way in which such measures may take effect in terms of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0575">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1039</span>
new boundaries. Catholic children currently resident in Helensburgh and attending the Catholic school in Dumbarton would continue to receive free school transport, financed by the Argyll and Bute council. Needless to say, the new provisions will apply to all schools, both denominational and non-denominational.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should hope so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is entitled to express that hope, and it will be respected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 51(2)(a) of the 1980 Act provides a discretionary power for an education authority to make transport arrangements in respect of placing requests legislation. The new clause makes it clear that that power will apply whether the school for which the placing request was made and which, in turn, a particular pupil attends is managed by that authority or by another authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause also clarifies the power of an education authority under section 50 to make special arrangements for the education of pupils in exceptional circumstances. That is an important clarification and meets fully the legitimate concerns expressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have sought to explain these new clauses as fully as possible, and I have provided the Committee with a response to the points that have been raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My question is very simple: the Minister said that the costs will be taken into account. By whom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made it clear that those matters will be discussed by the COSLA finance working group and the Scottish Office. That always happened in the past and it will continue to do so in the future. We all accept that funding must be available, as it has been in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that no new money will be available?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will recall the meeting that he had with the Catholic Education Commission on Wednesday 16 February. Will he confirm that at that meeting an agreed press statement was produced to deal with any press inquiries? Will he explain why, in 	<i>Scotland on Sunday</i> on 27 February, it was asserted that Government sources were trying to discredit Archbishop Winning?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1040</span>
That report quotes a Scottish Office source as saying that Archbishop Winning misfocused his case and it further implied that he had shouted at the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is rubbish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not rubbish. Will the Minister explain how that happened? Was it at the behest of a Scottish Office Minister? Was the political adviser, who is often present at this Committee, involved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had a most amicable and helpful meeting with Archbishop Winning. He acted professionally. All his representations have been considered with the utmost care. It was an extremely good meeting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Archbishop did not shout?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Archbishops do not shout. I am not responsible for everything that appears in the press.
