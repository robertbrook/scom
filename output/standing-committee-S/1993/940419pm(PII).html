It is common ground between the Government and the Opposition that the current figure of 2p in the pound, based on 1988–89 rateable values, should be updated. The per capita amount that the amendment mentions is £3.80, which applies to local authorities in England and Wales. I have examined the figures. A £3.80 limit would mean maximum expenditure of £19 million by Scottish local authorities. Current expenditure is £13 million, but, as the hon. Gentleman said, it is spent on industrial and economic development activities. He was right that the bulk of expenditure under section 83 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 is on those activities. Those activities are covered by clause 157, however, and will not count against section 83 expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have two corrections to announce to today's selection list. Government new clause 42 is listed for debate, but it has already been debated in a previous
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1938</span>
group of amendments. I will therefore call it for formal decision only.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 901 to the title will be added to the group of amendments beginning with new clause 60.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I heard the Minister say that this was just a matter of updating. I think that we must accept that the Minister is downgrading the flexibility available to local authorities by this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concept of the Labour party in local government is that local government should have some power to act. There was just a little of that power to act available under section 83. I think that the Minister will find that there were more cases in Scotland of the imaginative use of section 83 that were not offensive to any party and which, in my experience on Stirling district council, were certainly supported by all parties in developing initiatives with the private sector than the other way round. At that time, the districts had no specific power in industrial development, but section 83 was a way of getting that power. Perhaps in England and Wales councils are thought to have abused that power when using it for various purposes. That is not the case in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government wish to constrain local government in Scotland and to impose on the authorities an inabiity to act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the figures that the Minister quoted, the present calculation of £3.80 would total £19 million for the whole of Scotland. In reality, if he kept the equivalent of the 2p rate—the 1988–89 rateable value, which became the fixed value for that sum of money—the total would be £114 million for Scotland. That is a sizeable sum, but it is not, in terms of the imagination and development ethos of local government in Scotland, a great deal of money. It is a sum of money for which people in local government could find imaginative and positive uses. It would have given local authorities a residual power to act, but the Government are reducing that ability. The calculation is that the equivalent would equate to a community charge of £11.30 per head of population. That would be the amount of flexibility that local authorities would have if the 2p rate principle had been kept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not convinced by the Government's comments that they have thought this out. It is just another knee-jerk reaction, which is antagonistic towards local government and the good work done by local councils and officials in developing a diversity of provision and of quality of life throughout Scotland. It is another shameful move by the Government, which is not supported in any way by the Minister's poor explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause seems to have rather more significance than we were originally led to believe. It has to do with whether local authorities have a general competence to undertake activities for the general good. The clause will entail discarding the doctrine of ultra vires. If the Government do not accept the principle of the power of general competence, is it not incumbent on Ministers to set out clearly their own views on what the role of local government should be?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not so far in this Committee referred to the Wheatley commission, which was of the view that local
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1073">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1939</span>
authorities should not be limited by their statutory range of functions and that they should possess a power of general competence making it possible for them to act outside the cover of a specific enabling statute in appropriate circumstances. Wheatley said:
	<br><q><p>"Such a power might be rarely exercised and yet it could prove profoundly effective in encouraging 'an enterprising and forward looking attitude of mind' in local government towards the particular needs of the area, which even the most comprehensive series of statutes cannot altogether provide for. The power should be granted to all local authorities on an equal footing."</p></q>
Wheatley was also of the view that a general competence power should not be restricted in financial terms or by the need to secure approval from any higher authority. In paragraph 641, it says:
	<br><q><p>"It is to the local electorate that the local council should have to answer for the use of such a power. Any restrictions should be aimed … simply at curbing any possible abuse of the powers by way of interference with private rights or the duties of other public bodies."</p></q>
The Commission went on to recommend that the Government should examine what form the safeguards would need to take when considering legislation on general competence. The introduction of a power of general competence would have both a symbolic and psychological importance. It would demonstrate the view that local authorities existed not simply to provide services but to represent their communities in the broadest sense. Local authorities should be seen as a legitimate voice of the community with a concern for all public services in their areas, not merely as one agency among many others responsible for delivering services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I end with a financial question arising out of clause 150(3). As regards the Government's specific proposal to limit further discretionary expenditure, the adequacy of the financial limit of £3.80 per head of population for section 83 expenditure compares badly with the discretionary powers currently available to local authorities, namely the product of the 2p rate in 1988–89. Given that this power is currently available to both regions and districts, the total amount of discretionary expenditure currently available to all Scottish authorities is £57.9 million. The proposal in the Bill to limit discretionary expenditure by single tier authorities would produce a total amount for the new authorities of £19.4 million, which represents a reduction of 66 per cent on the current limit. Do the Government accept that what I have said is generally true? If it is, it raises serious questions about the future of local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have all received the same brief as the hon. Member for Linlithgow. I hope that I can reassure him and the hon. Member for Falkirk, East. The product of a 2p rate, which he referred to as being £114 million, is actually £61 million. But that upper limit is entirely academic. I have already made the point that the huge bulk of this expenditure is on industrial and economic development powers, which are covered in clause 171 and following clauses. The limit that would be imposed under the Government's proposals would involve an upper expenditure of £19 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. The Minister has just referred to clause 171 but there are only 169 clauses in the Bill. Are there some other clauses of which no one else in the Committee is aware?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1940</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that that is helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that the hon. Member for Dundee, East with his customary acumen is not only awake but following my every word. I meant to refer to clause 157, not clause 171, which does not exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present level of expenditure by Scottish local authorities under section 83—other than on industrial and economic development activities—is about £3 million. The limit that the formula will impose will be £19 million. So, by any standards, the revised formula will give Scottish local authorities a large margin to spend under section 83 powers in the interests of their areas. That figure has not been plucked out of thin air—it is the same formula as applies in England and Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a long time since the Minister received the brief on the clause. Is there anything in that brief that is inaccurate? This is central to the whole question of the competence of local authorities. The Minister said that he received the COSLA brief. That is good, because that saves us a lot of time, but he ought then to be able to say if the Government accept its general accuracy on this crucial clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is up to the Minister to decide whether to make a further contribution to the debate, but the hon.

The purpose of the amendment is to clarify a council's right to act reasonably in managing debt. I see no reason for the Government not accepting the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the purpose of the amendment.

	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 878, in page 97, line 41, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>"(1A) Before making regulations under this section the Secretary of State shall consult such associations of local authorities as appear to him to be appropriate.".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1941</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 879, in page 98, leave out lines 41 to 43 and add—
	<br><q><p>"(7) An order made under this section shall not be made unless a draft order has been laid before and approved by resolution of both Houses of Parliament.".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The COSLA brief on the amendment, which I shall not read out in full, begins by saying
	<br><q><p>"Local authority borrowing is an extremely complex subject"—</p></q>
that must be one of the understatements of the whole of the Committee's proceedings. It continues
	<br><q><p>"and one where practical considerations must be kept firmly in mind."</p></q>
The amendments are practical. The first would oblige the Government to consult local authorities—which are, after all the experts in local government borrowing—before any orders are made. That is a perfectly respectable and reasonable duty to lay on the Government concerning orders to be made under the clause. Amendment No. 879 returns us to the question—raised several times before—whether the orders that litter the Bill and give powers to the Secretary of State for Scotland should be made by positive or negative resolution in Parliament. Another negative procedure is contained in the Bill as drafted. It is intolerable for orders arising out of the consequence of those under discussion—they are of substantial importance to local authorities and involve huge amounts of public money—to be buried in the negative assent procedure in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to accept our argument that Parliament should have the right to a deliberate say on the issue. The Bill contains too many proposals that give the Secretary of State brand new powers to take action by order. Even this Government will come to regret the number of such powers given to the Secretary of State for Scotland. The Conservative party will regret it if there is a Labour Government during the brief period that the Secretary of State would wield those powers before an elected Scottish Parliament took them over. I do not believe that the Conservative party would want to go down that road. I press the Minister to accept these practical, sensible amendments, which would help the Government to achieve their aims.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that other Members want to contribute to the debate but I shall give the Committee a preliminary explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 878, I give the hon. Member for Hamilton an absolute assurance that we shall consult the appropriate local authority association—COSLA—before making regulations under the clause. There might, however, be exceptional cases in which the Government would have to move rapidly. I place on record, however, that in all normal circumstances we would consult COSLA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In respect of amendment No. 879, given that any regulations will deal mainly with administrative detail rather than with major issues of principle, they lend themselves well to the negative procedure. I take the hon. Gentleman's point that more substantial issues may be involved in such regulations. Therefore, on balance, I recommend that the Committee should accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would this part of the Bill replace the procedures contained in the Local Government
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1942</span>
(Scotland) Acts of 1973 and 1975? It is believed by those working in finance that this may be an opportunity to improve and clarify the legal position. Everyone in Scotland and elsewhere is aware of the problems faced by authorities involved in the BCCI financing deal and no one wants that to be repeated. Similarly, everyone must admire the way in which local authority finance officers have grown in their expertise; they are often ACCA and CIPFA qualified. They have developed expertise and shown great flexibility without endangering local authority funds. I can claim some knowledge of the subject because my dissertation in my honours year at university was on local government finance and the theory of money. I have had some interesting discussions with people in local authorities. They need a good legal framework within which to work but their imagination and creativity should not be cut off by restrictive Government practices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask first for an assurance that their power will not be diminished by clause 151, that the powers of local authority finance departments will not be diminished and that the authorities will be protected. Secondly, the regime that results should be a protected not a restrictive one. It should not remove local discretion which has become the hallmark of good financing of local authorities in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister has the COSLA brief, and in spite of my hon. Friends' irritation, I ask what would have been the Government's reply to the COSLA brief on BCCI? That raises matters of considerable importance. Rather than read the whole brief, we could at least have a reply to it in relation to amendment No. 878.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The matters raised by the hon. Member for Linlithgow have already been covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I can assure the hon. Member for Falkirk, East that he is absolutely right about the provisions in relation to the 1973 and 1975 Acts. It is in everyone's interests that uncertainties should be removed. There is nothing restrictive in the provisions. I hope that they will be generally welcomed by the local government finance experts to whom the hon. Gentleman properly referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to speak about race relations and the grant in relation to ethnic minorities. There is a general worry about clause 152, the amendments to schedule 13 and new clause 52.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Widespread concern is felt in Scotland among those involved in race relations about the uncertainty that the upheaval of reorgansiation will cause and about the adequacy of funding. That may not be a matter for the Bill but people are nevertheless worried about it. There is also a question mark over section 11 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1966, which has not been activated in Scotland. We seek a general reassurance from the Minister on the question of race relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to dramatise matters, but we have seen terrible happenings and goings on in England. I believe that there is more stability in Scotland on that sensitive issue, but the matter nevertheless requires investment and adequate funding. I am sure that the briefings that we have received from all who are concerned are genuine in intent. I hope that the issue will not divide us politically because we merely seek the reassurance that those interest groups want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My comments on clause 152 are aimed at soliciting a sympathetic approach from the Government. We shall touch again on those matters when we deal with the schedule and new clause. The key issue is that we want an assurance that funding will not be reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also want a bipartisan commitment that the work of local authorities in Scotland in support of race relation activities will not be diminished by the creation of far smaller councils in Scotland. It would be true to say that the commitment of some may vary compared with that of others but there is excellent provision in Glasgow, Strathclyde and many of the major regions. Even in my authority, significant progress has been made and although our ethnic community is very small it has to endure significant problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1944</span>
With an element of good will towards the Government's commitment on the issue, I ask the Minister to comment on the matters that I have raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that there is any real difference between us. The hon. Member was right to say that section 11 has not been used in Scotland because of our alternative arrangements in relation to the urban programme and the provision in grant-aided expenditure for extra teachers in areas with high concentrations of ethnic minorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the clause will be widely welcomed because it enables grant to be paid in respect of ethnic minorities as against the present position whereby the grant can only be paid in respect of people of Commonwealth origin. The widening of the scope of section 11 will be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, Central asked for a general commitment to provide assistance to race relations in Scotland, but I do not think that he will expect me to commit the Government to provide increased resources. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the clause will widen the scope of the present arrangements and, judging from the tone of his comments, I do not believe that there is any disagreement between us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's comments and I believe that he has confirmed that the Government's interpretation is that section 11 is not needed because they argue that, with funding from various other sources, the total level of funding is adequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to make a request of the Minister which is unusual because this is a Committee dealing with a Bill and is not a general debating chamber. Concerns are being expressed by people in Scotland who work on race relations. My parting shot to the Minister is to ask whether, when the Committee's proceedings have finished, he is willing to meet a deputation from Strathclyde and elsewhere for a dialogue about the future. I know that such discussions take place in any case, but it would cement the Government's good will towards race relations that, sadly, will become increasingly important because of some of the nastier events that have occurred, especially in the south. It would go some way to reassure those who are involved in race relations in Scotland if the Minister would meet a delegation to discuss many of the problems and give a first-hand reassurance that the Government remain committed to tackling the problems of race relations no matter where they occur in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the Minister that there is nothing sinister in my genuine request that he meet the people involved at the sharp end of race relations. That would reassure them at a difficult time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Minister specifically whether he has discussed the matter with the Commission for Racial Equality? Have proposals in later clauses been discussed with the commission?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, we are in close touch with the Commission for Racial Equality, although I have not met members of the commission personally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, Central made a perfectly reasonable request. The responsibilities of my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West mean that he is very

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1945</span>
involved in that area as well, but I am happy to give a commitment that either my hon. Friend or I will be glad to meet a delegation such as one that the hon. Gentleman described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 156 states:
	<br><q><p>"It shall be the duty of each local authority to make proper arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources."</p></q>
What does the clause mean? Who decides what is effective, efficient or economic in the use of resources? What is different in the clause from existing Audit Commission powers? What criteria are involved, and how are they to be imposed? It is a statement of the obvious: every council with which I have been involved automatically has tried to achieve economy, effectiveness and efficiency. Councillors are liable to surcharge if they spend illegally, so what is the purpose of the clause?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who is to measure efficiency or effectiveness in the use of resources? Do the Government have any performance criteria in mind? If so, will Ministers tell the Committee what they are before the Bill becomes law instead of imposing the measure on local authorities? Will such normative rules be issued by the Government? Central Government are notoriously less efficient and effective in their use of resources than local authorities. Local authority budgets come in very close to target; very few Chancellors of the Exchequer under this Government can say the same. I recommend that the Minister re-examine the COSLA critique, which makes that point in some detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is the clause in the Bill? The Government have not been keen to include in the Bill many items whose necessity is obvious to Opposition Members. The clause would impose a legal duty, but how can that subjective duty be delivered objectively? A change of Government could mean that a different set of criteria would be adopted. Is not the clause unfair on local authorities, and does it not impose on them a duty that central Government fail to keep?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause imposes a duty on local authorities to secure economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the use of resources. However, that seems to contradict existing restrictions imposed by the Fire Services Act 1947 and by the Water (Scotland) Act 1980. If the clause is to stand, will the Secretary of State remove the financial burdens from the fire brigades by amending those Acts? Section 31(1) of the Fire Services Act should be amended to allow brigades to cover costs caused by repeated false alarm calls activated by faulty alarm systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituent and friend Jack Cunningham, a former secretary to the Fire Brigades Union, alerted me to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1946</span>
fact that there was a problem. I do not say that he went into the detail of the next question that I will ask.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 1(1) of the 1947 Act lays a duty on fire authorities to make provision for fire fighting purposes. That needs to be amended to provide additional funding for the increasing number of non-fire emergency calls that the brigades are expected to attend, such as road accidents, building collapses, train crashes and natural disasters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 47(6)(b) of the Water (Scotland) Act 1980 should be amended to defray the cost of fire hydrant installation to the developer benefiting from the installation. The brigades are responsible for the cost of hydrant provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My question arises from those matters. Do the Government have the agreement of the fire services on the clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fire services have not been directly involved, but I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman's questions. It would be appropriate if I took advice on the matters relating to the 1947 Act and wrote to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) asked me why the provision was included. The answer is that it makes an explicit duty on local authorities to have regard to value for money, which is implicit in current legislation. There is a need for that to be made technically clear in legislation. The clause makes clear and explicit what is implicit in current legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Angus, East also asked who would have a duty to enforce. I assure him that the Secretary of State will not be issuing guidance. The duty will be that of the local authority auditor. That duty is being made explicit. I hope that that helps the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That still begs the question, who is to decide what is efficient and effective in individual circumstances? The local authorities with which I have had dealings did that in practice, but someone has to have objective criteria and performance indicators. The Government have been happy to issue them in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried because making explicit a measure that was implicit is the problem. A legal duty will be laid, but there is no definition. Who is to define, if it is possible, what is efficient and effective in the delivery of services? The local authorities will soon enough be punished by central Government if they decide to interpret the measure in any way that they please.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are not making it clear to local authorities what they should be doing. I should have liked much more definition; local authorities would like to know what the measure means in daily practice, because they will have to obey it. It is unfair of central Government to lay down a blanket obligation on local authorities when the definition within it is not at all clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister think again? An additional obligation, which will be difficult to deliver in practice unless central Government make it clear what they want, is being deliberately and specifically laid on local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to add a postscript to the contribution of the hon. Member for Angus, East. The measure will be a double-edged sword under a Labour

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1947</span>
Government. Although the clause might appear reasonable, as the hon. Gentleman said, it would be impossible—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Knapman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stroud)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Angus, East has already said that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, I am just repeating a point, something for which the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Knapman) has often criticised the hon. Member for Angus, East.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause could be used with criteria being developed. The Government's emphasis will be not effectiveness, but economy. If the provision is on the statute book when we form a Labour Government, we shall want to examine the effectiveness and efficiency of Tory-controlled councils in providing nursery facilities, community and further education and concessionary fares, and their approach to many other issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nobody would argue against the need for all three Es, but it is a bit silly to include a clause without further development. Our worry is that that development will mean a whole string of economy criteria, which will, again, prevent authorities from doing a reasonable job. I thought that it would be useful to remind the Minister that after 15, 16 or 17 years, things can change. Instead of the Government's more sinister motives, we may be able to use the clause positively in the interests of consumers and constituents. I am sure that the Minister will accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly will not accept that. I shall not rise to the various baits that the hon. Member for Fife, Central has thrown. In the light of what he and the hon. Member for Angus, East said, it might be helpful to add a word or two about the technicalities of the clause, which is not nearly as wide ranging as has been suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, section 99(c) of the 1973 Act, as inserted by section 35(4) of the Local Government Act 1988, places a duty on a local authority auditor to satisfy himself that the authority has made proper arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness—the three Es to which the hon. Member for Fife, Central referred—in its use of resources. Although the terms of section 99(c) might be considered to carry a clear implication that a local authority itself must make such arrangements, the legislation at present does not contain an explicit statement to that effect. The effect of the clause will be to remedy that omission. To repeat what I said earlier, the clause makes explicit what is implicit in current legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It puts the duty on local authorities, but it does not make explicit what that duty is. I am still unhappy about that: it is another central Government power clamped onto local authorities to be interpreted as central Government wishes. I am still waiting for the Minister to give a definition of criteria. There is a definitive duty for economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the use of resources. We can all cheer that, but what does it mean in practice? Two different Governments could have two different interpretations. A Labour
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1948</span>
Government could emphasise social efficiency—I should be very happy if they did. A Tory Government might maintain that there is a financial efficiency. I should be unhappy if that meant that services would be lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made explicit in the Committee that I am all for efficiency in the use of money, but the problem is that that is open to interpretation, depending on who is in power. What is explicit is the power included in the Bill and that power is placed on local authorities. The Minister should give a definition before he puts such explicit power on the authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 880, in page 103, line 12, leave out "for approval" and insert
	<br><q><p>", whose consent shall not be unreasonably withheld".</p></q>
You will be pleased to note, Sir James, that the Committee is coming back to life at this late hour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 157 is very important because it deals with economic development. The context for this debate is the fact that the Scottish economy is not in good shape; Unemployment is at nearly 250,000, nearly 40,000 male jobs have been lost from the start of the so-called recovery in April 1992 and the skills levels are quite deplorable. Based on the Government's most recent labour force survey, for example, current employees constitute less than 10 per cent. of Scottish people in work receiving any form of skills training. We have a skills crisis, a jobs crisis and an unemployment crisis. That reinforces the importance of anything to do with economic development in the next two to three years. The key to this particular clause is the question of local authority involvement and the relationship—or should I say the tension—between local authorities and local enterprise companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 880 concerns the ability of Scottish local authorities to promote economic development outwith the United Kingdom. We are keen to probe the Government on the Secretary of State's intentions about obtaining information about that issue. Do the Government see a positive role for the local authorities in the years ahead?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Strategic authorities such as Strathclyde and Lothian and smaller authorities such as Fife and Central have a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1078">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1949</span>
significant role in economic development because of their size and their ability to co-ordinate large scale activities and organisations. Once we move to the single-tier unitary councils, the game becomes different because of the nature of the authorities and their abilities to tackle various problems. There will be a qualitative change in what those single-tier authorities might be able to do. We are trying to retain the significant powers, responsibilities and activity of the regions, while the crazy reorganisation implements single-tier councils that might not be able to undertake such tasks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 880 deals with development overseas. Local authorities, along with Locate in Scotland, the Scottish Development Agency and Scottish Enterprise, have had a distinguished record in attracting companies. There has been great harmony between the local authorities and the key national agencies. Apart from the dismembering of the local government structure by the Government, local authorities feel that they are always under attack. As we shall discuss when we consider amendment No. 895, local authorities will be restricted in what they can do economically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do the Government still have any faith in local authorities in relation to their economic activities? The Opposition think that the best local authority economic development in Scotland stands in comparison with anything found in the United Kingdom. That must continue, because of the problems that I briefly outlined at the start of my contribution. The Government's reassurances are crucial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government must explain whether local authorities will be able to continue to promote economic development outwith the United Kingdom. The work of the local authorities, Locate and other agencies in Scotland stand much higher in my esteem than what is happening in England and Wales with the Department of Employment. The leader of the Labour party highlighted a scurrilous attempt by the Government to sell Britain in Germany as a low-wage, sweatshop economy. My hon. Friends will remember the advertisements that were placed in German newspapers to attract other companies to Britain—emphasising not the best of British, but the worst examples of low pay, low skills and low tech companies. We do not want to see that any more. It was an embarrassment to Britain and a kick in the teeth for those who want to see Britain, and Scotland, as a high wage, high tech, high skill and high productivity nation. We cannot stress too much the importance of attracting inward investment and giving local authorities a powerful role in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the context of amendment No. 895, we shall examine the restrictions that the Bill will impose on local authorities and we want a brief discussion of local enterprise companies. We all supported the Child Support Agency, but we can see what a crippling shambles that has become since its implementation. On local enterprise companies—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may say that, but in my short time in Parliament, I have not known another piece of legislation that has caused so much hardship and misery and so many problems to people who do not need the extra burden. The Government promised us that they
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1950</span>
would pursue those who are not paying—I am sorry for disgressing, Sir James, but the matter makes me very angry—yet they are pursuing those whom they can get their hands on quickly, with no benefit to the children or the mothers, but a benefit to the Treasury. It is a disgraceful abuse of legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's comments are relevant to the Government's proposals in the Bill. The hon. Member for Swindon (Mr. Coombs) said in the Chamber that the establishment of the CSA was a great mistake. If the hon. Gentleman was in Committee, he might recognise that we all make mistakes. That was a gross error on the part of the Government; the Bill could be another. Perhaps the Government should waken up to that before it is too late.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton makes an excellent point, but the bottom line is that the Government never learn any lesson.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You have to say that, Henry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South is a gem. He sits there, strokes his hair, abuses hon. Members from a sedentary position, then has a drink of water to get ready for the next piece of abuse. He contributes to the debate, but he is shy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us return to the analogy between the CSA and local enterprise companies. We were led to believe that local enterprise companies—Scottish Enterprise—would be the saviour of the Scottish economy, but they have been a huge disappointment. Despite being shored up by the Government and despite vacuous comments being made monthly to defend what they are up to, there has been scandal after scandal concerning their activities. We should be extremely careful if we denude local authorities of their economic powers and provide more powers to local enterprise companies, which have not proved themselves. It would be a dangerous move to allow local enterprise companies to be more actively involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment and new clause 68 relate to the consultation between local enterprise companies and local authorities. We expect the Government to respond to amendment No. 880 and deal with the promotion of economic development outside the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central has explained, the amendment deals with the ability of local authorities to promote their own economies outside the United Kingdom. The Minister and his hon. Friends always tell us that we now live in a global economy. It is therefore vital that the power of local authorities to participate in that global economy should not be diminished by the proposals in the clause.

I discovered this morning from a press statement faxed to me by the London International Group, which is also known as London Rubber, that it was to close its manufacturing capacity in Dundee, with the loss of more than 50 jobs. Allied to the closure in Dundee, 600 jobs were lost in London as well as jobs in south Wales. Production is switching to Malaysia. Local authorities have to try to grapple with that. The Dundee partnership includes Tayside regional council and Dundee district

council. It attempts to attract inward investment to our part of Scotland. Therefore, local authorities take on an international role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Oil Venture group, which is associated with the Dundee partnership, regularly goes to Houston and has a stand at the oil industry exhibition there. Tayside regional council and Dundee district council send staff to Houston and second business people to go there and work on the stand to sell Dundee and Tayside and to attract oil investment to our country. I hope that the Minister will assure us that the clause will not diminish local authorities' ability to participate in such activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not simply considering the Oil Venture group. A roll on, roll off ferry briefly operated in Dundee. Local authorities are still trying to promote it and a link between Dundee and Holland. Local authority councillors and officials have travelled to Holland to establish a link between it and Dundee. Again, I hope that the Minister will assure the Committee that successor authorities will be able to carry out such activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities often support, through the chamber of commerce, trade delegations to various parts of the world. Those delegations try to bring business to our part of the country. Those authorities live in the real world and the global economy. It is essential that they are able to travel outside the United Kingdom to attract investment, although they do not do that to rival the national activities of Locate. We are not considering large inward investment projects, such as manufacturing plants in Dundee, but business and communication links, which are vital to the survival of our part of Scotland. No one in Scotland will be happy for the Minister to take away such initiatives from local authorities. That includes Conservative councillors who support and participate in many such activities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be grateful if the Minister could clarify whether the proposals would affect, for example, the Govan Initiative. It was established as a public-private partnership, which acts almost on an agency basis on behalf of Strathclyde region and Glasgow district to explore several innovative ways in which to resurrect an area. Several initiatives have been undertaken; many should have been visited by Ministers. I would regret any inhibition of its activities or of parallel activities elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to support amendment No. 880. Clause 157 will not make up for what is happening to local authorities. The damage that the Government will do when they break up existing local authorities will not be repaired by a small piece of sticking plaster. Without the ability to make local authorities come together to do something new—perhaps to sell the wares of a group of authorities overseas—we have nothing to offer local authorities to encourage them to form themselves into something that is against the Government's philosophy, which is to break up and disaggregate local authorities.

constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, West (Mr. Canavan)—I have informed the Minister's office that it was not in my constituency. In Larbert, the local authority citizens council spent £140 million on buying a site from a trust hospital—established by the Government—which was asset stripping the buildings and land that it had been left. If the local authority had not had the sort of financial muscle that a region has—no district or unitary authority as small as anything proposed for central Scotland will have such muscle—no one could have bought that site. It would have remained redundant, or been sold for housing or some other use which would not have generated the economic initiatives with which the Minister will want to associate himself in the next few weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the local authorities are broken up, the new authorities will not have that kind of financial muscle. So initiatives such as those at Callender Park, where the dreaded Child Support Agency is based in Scotland, and Larbert could not happen. The development of offices in Stirling could not go ahead. Therefore, the Government will have seriously damaged the ability of local authorities to promote economic development. Clause 171 will do nothing for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To give an example of overseas involvement, the co-operation of Central regional council with the then Scottish Development Agency brought Wang to the university site in Stirling. When Wang suffered from the recession and lack of technological advance in the computer industry, Compaq was found to fill that space. Yet another hi-tech user has since been found. Without the abilities that people such as John Shaw and Geoff Peart of central region have shown in going out into the market, local authorities will be seriously constrained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had to table the amendment because the Government do not recognise the economic development deficiency that the boundary changes will cause in Scotland. The Government do not recognise that that deficiency will occur if local authorities are not given an extra incentive to come together to try to make the best of a bad job. Scotland will be left with a very bad job when the authorities are broken up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without the amendment, clause 171 is considerably weaker. There is absolutely no panacea for the Government if they think that local authorities will have a role to play in the economic regeneration of their areas, as they had when they were regions and big enough to do the job properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I promise to be brief, but I want to add to what my colleagues have said. When I was leader of Edinburgh city council and then leader of the economic development committee, there used to be regular meetings with the local Members of Parliament, of which the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Eastwood was one, as he was between ministerial appointments. We could always rely on him to be a thorn in the flesh of the Government. When he argued the case for Renfrewshire, we knew that we had a staunch ally who would support the area against the Government. That happened time and again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recall several conversations with the Under-Secretary when he was acting as a local Member of Parliament in which he criticised what had happened to the economic development of Edinburgh. He said what a breath of

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1953</span>
fresh air there was when Andrew Cowe—now managing director—became director of planning, as the council really got going on economic development. The council could do so because of the powers that existed. It could be enthusiastic because it had scope to operate within the law. I hope that the Under-Secretary will remember how strongly he felt in those days about the promotion of economic development by local authorities and return to some of his old ways. He has become spoilt since he has been a Minister. I remember how angry he used to become.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did he?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the Under-Secretary used to become very angry when he arrived at Glasgow airport and saw the sign "Welcome to Irvine". He used to say that that was a disgrace as the council should have promoted Renfrew district. When he saw the signs that said "What's it called? Cumbernauld" he also became very angry. I hope he will recall the days when he used to care far more about the issue than he seems to now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it was my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East who said that, as we are now in a global market, it is important to compete with other localities in different parts of the world to attract inward investment and development to our constituencies. I cannot help but remind the hon. Member for Stroud in particular, that we are now citizens of the European Union and that it is important that we can compete on an equal basis in the single European market. Just as we have shared our sovereignty with the English since 1707, whether or not the hon. Member for Angus, East likes it, so all of us must now share our sovereignty with our counterparts in other parts of the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to know how our local authorities will compare with those in other parts of the European Union. Whether we like it or not, our local authorities will have to compete for development with equivalent communities in every other part of the European Union. Will local authorities have to go crawling, cap in hand, with schemes to the Secretary of State for Scotland every year and say, "Please may we spend X thousand pounds on seeking extra development and employment in our localities?" Are equivalent central Government restrictions applied to local authorities in other parts of the European Union?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. This is a serious matter. Earlier this evening, I was informed that the hon. Member for Tayside, North today became a grandfather with the birth of a granddaughter. On behalf of all member of the Committee, I warmly congratulate him on this unique occasion. I want to record a genuine welcome to the new arrival into the world and hope that she will be off to a flying start due to the fact that she now has the unanimous good will of the First Scottish Standing Committee on the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is almost the first valid point of order in Committee so far. I agree, especially since the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. On behalf of my wife, my daughter and her
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1954</span>
husband, I genuinely welcome the good wishes that I have received. People outside rarely understand or realise the comradeship and genuine good will that exists between us all. Parliament is a marvellous place because one makes lots of friends, many of whom are not necessarily of the same political persuasion. We can differ on matters of politics, but when it comes to matters which affect us or our families, there are no better friends than those one finds in Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No doubt normal service will be resumed, but I congratulate the hon. Member for Hamilton on his wholly valid and admirable point of order. I formally second his point of order, which I am sure is completely out of order, by congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North and his family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to the amendment—I am afraid that normal service is being resumed—I appreciate its intention, but I have checked it carefully and believe it to be unnecessary because of existing constraints on how the Secretary of State can use his powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want briefly to respond to the general concerns that were expressed by Opposition Members. I can give an unequivocal yes to the hon. Member for Govan who asked whether the Govan Initiative would be able to continue its activities under the new legislation. I can give him an absolute assurance on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new local authorities will all have the same powers which are currently enjoyed by the regional councils which, as hon. Members know, have wider powers than district councils on this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, they will not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With one exception, as the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley has suggested, that, under section 171A, local authorities will be required to seek the approval of the Secretary of State for such activities by submitting an annual plan. It will be open to the Secretary of State to withhold approval for any such plan or for any part of such a plan in the same way as he may at present withhold approval for any proposal for overseas activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was touched by the recollection of the hon. Member for Paisley, South (Mr. McMaster) of the good old days. I did not get angry; I never do. We enjoyed some excellent and constructive discussions and I hope that we shall continue to have such discussions on Renfrewshire, as we have done on the Glasgow airport initiative. I am not sure whether I shall put his glowing comments in my election address for the next general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My key point is that, with the one exception to which I have referred, the powers make no change to the present position. I believe that it is reasonable for the Secretary of State to have powers of approval because it can be counter productive if delegations from different parts of Scotland all individually try to attract a particular overseas investment to Scotland in an unco-ordinated way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is quite natural for people from different localities to want an inward investment project in their area, but we must ensure that we put our best foot forward for Scotland
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1081">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1955</span>
as a whole against competition from other parts of the Community. That requires a co-ordinated approach. We shall not be stopping the new local authorities from exercising their current economic and industrial development activities, but the Secretary of State's powers of approval are necessary to ensure such an approach. The powers have now been accepted and there is very little dispute about them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. I think that the Committee has made a dreadful mistake. I have been wondering all day why the hon. Member for Angus, East has been sitting quietly, saying so little. After the congratulations on the new arrival he was even more quiet. I have realised why. We have forgotten that today is his 50th birthday. Even my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg), were he here, would be able to join in the unique, not to be repeated congratulations from the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that, as a teetotaller, the hon. Member for Tayside, North will not open a bottle of champagne to wet the baby's head, but, now that he has received the congratulations of the Committee, the hon. Member for Angus, East, being such a kind and generous man, will certainly take us all Downstairs and do the decent thing as soon as the Committee has risen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. I sincerely thank the hon. Gentleman. If he is cadging a drink, he may just be successful. It has been an unfortunate day for me. My daughter gave me a badge stating, "If found, please return to nearest old folks' home". The granddaughter of the hon. Member for Tayside, North and I share the same birthday. I add my congratulations, but I have been trying to hide it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one could be reassured by the Minister's comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have said that I was speaking from a COSLA brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman could not have been because there were not 25 questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You will agree, Sir James, that this is not the best background against which to discuss Scotland's key economic problems, but I shall do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not reassured by the Minister's comments. This is a probing amendment on economic development outside the United Kingdom. The powers will remain with the new single tiers, but it is clear that the economic clout in the regions will be dissipated by this crazy restructuring. The Minister conceded that the Secretary of State wants to take more meddling powers requiring local authorities to consult, which most of them do anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1956</span>
I do not want to delay the Committee as we want to move on to more substantial issues and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment made.</i> No. 689, in page 103, line 29, for "162" substitute "90".—[	<i>Mr. Stewart.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 895, in page 103, line 31, leave out from beginning to end of line 16 on page 104.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I touched on some of the matters covered by the amendment when discussing amendment No. 182. New section 171B on page 103 of the Bill is entitled
	<br><q><p>"Restrictions on promotion of economic development."</p></q>
The new section is an attempt to shackle local authorities in the new system. It is necessary for all those involved in economic development in Scotland not to be restrained even more, but to be allowed to be innovative, to work much harder to attract inward investment and to generate economic growth and prosperity in Scotland. The clause restricts local authorities in their economic development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The simple question is why do we need to do that? The Government are willing to try to promote the local enterprise companies, but at the expense of local authorities. With the greatest respect to the Fife local enterprise company, which does a reasonable job, it does not do half as good a job as Fife regional council's economic development unit. They work closely together, but if the local enterprise company did not exist, there would be no diminution of the economic thrust in that area. That throws into sharp focus the reason why we are asking the Government not to restrict and inhibit local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have an excellent set-up and even if the reorganisation proceeds, it cannot be beyond the wit of the Government to introduce—as they have done for the police and fire services and as they want to do for education and social work with joint committees—a powerful regional basis to complement what local enterprise companies and Scottish Enterprise are doing and ensure that the very best of Scottish initiative is at the forefront of the economic challenge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why do the Government not share that aspiration? Why is it that whenever we discuss what is good in local government, the Government's ideological dislike and pathological hatred for local government comes to the surface? We cannot afford the luxury of the Government behaving like dinosaurs in Scotland; we need encouragement for local authorities to do better. We very much regret that this restrictive part of the clause is in the Bill and the amendment would delete it. Unless the Government can justify the restrictions economically, they have no right, in Committee or in the Bill, to attack local authorities and to make their job tougher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of resources, the restriction on local authorities carries an overtone of fewer resources being available for economic development. In Scotland, nearly £450 million is being spent on the enterprise network, including Scottish Enterprise. Clearly, some of that money is being misused and is missing its target. If the Government want a value-for-money approach to economic development, they can do no worse than to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1082">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1957</span>
boost the local authority funding for economic development and to remove silly clauses such as this which do nothing for anyone's morale, at a time of economic crisis in Scotland. It is an opportunity for the Government to put their prejudice behind them and start to address the real economic issues—which is what local authorities do, day in and day out. Why should they be booted again by the Government? The Minister should accept our amendment and I hope he will.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to speak about the amendment, which treats the subject of overseas promotion more broadly than the previous amendment. We have been joking about COSLA amendments, but in general I find them very helpful and I am grateful to the convention for supplying them. I am not, however, going to read the COSLA amendment verbatim: I see it as an aide-memoire, giving us the gist of the clauses and amendments. On the Labour Benches of the Committee, seven hon. Members, including me, have 65 years of local government experience between us. That is amazing. If we cannot pick out and emphasise the important issues in relation to local government without reading out an amendment, we ought not to be here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Eastwood, has been to my constituency, and was very helpful; he will remember the meetings he had with Cumnock and Doon Valley district council. As he knows, the Cumnock and Sanquhar travel-to-work area has the highest level of unemployment in mainland Britain—the Sanquhar part is within his constituency. He also knows that the district council—with some help from him, to give him credit—has put money into advance factory building and has given assistance to firms in difficulties and to new firms setting up. That has been necessary, to help preserve and create jobs. In Cumnock and Doon Valley, we have lost 4,500 coal mining jobs over the past decade and they need to be replaced. The district council has had a primary responsibility in doing that, but Strathclyde region has also brought in huge amounts of money from the European Community, the social fund and the RECHAR fund to create jobs in the area. I am concerned that all of that will be jeopardised by the clause. I hope that the Under-Secretary will consider that seriously. I do not believe that he would want to put undue restrictions on the local authority, preventing it from doing the work it has been doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the hon. Member for Ayr is here, because I want to mention what Kyle and Carrick has done. For the past two years, it has not—regrettably—been controlled by the Labour party, although it will be after the next election. Nevertheless, it has been doing some useful things; it has put money into Prestwick airport, for example. The Minister and I had a difference of view on transatlantic status, but I am sure that he will accept that now that Glasgow airport has been accorded transatlantic status he should not do anything that would undermine Prestwick airport. It is working hard to develop as a freight and charter airport; it is doing well with charter flights for this summer. The district council has helped PIK Limited and the development of the link between the new rail station and the airport. That is vital for industrial development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1958</span>
I hope that the Minister will think seriously about the amendment and about the arguments of my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central. I cannot believe that the Minister—or any party in the House—would want to harness local authorities in their drive and their much needed efforts to prevent industrial development, especially as areas such as Cumnock and Sanquhar have 20 per cent. unemployment—in that area male unemployment is much higher principally because of the decline in the coal mining industry. I hope that the Minister will look sympathetically at the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having listened to the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, I have to tell the Committee that Conservative Members have not quite achieved 65 years of local authority service between them, but seven of us have accrued some 57 years, which is a significant figure. Given other factors, it shows a great variety—57 varieties perhaps—of experience in local government. That is reflected in this debate. Conservative Members have contributed forcefully and positively. Unlike Opposition Members, we are always positive and constructive and with this clause the Government have provided a very good element in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel a little like a bad fairy. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley about COSLA amendments. If there is time, rightly, for grandchildren and birthdays to be discussed, there is also time for COSLA amendments to be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall take my hon. Friend's advice and just stick to four points, but I shall tell the Government how they arise. On Friday I went to see the Secretary of State open the massive extension to Sun Microsystems, a high-powered electronics firm in Linlithgow. I heard the new American president of Sun, Mr. Samper, say how much it owed to the cooperation of local authorities—and to the Scottish Office, I do not hide that fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In COSLA's considered opinion, it would be unreasonable for the Secretary of State to take to himself powers allowing him to restrict the activities of an authority in the promotion of the economic development of its area outwith the United Kingdom for insignificant reasons. That applies to the Sun company. The Minister knows well, because he had a good deal to do with this, that the same could have applied some years ago to Digital and doubtless to factories in his constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second question is about the considered opinion of the Widdecombe committee. I again refer to my brief, which is far wider than the COSLA brief. Local authorities in Scotland presently have considerable scope to incur expenditure on economic development under section 83 of the 1973 Act. As has been rightly said, that power has been exercised successfully. Why on earth, after the Widdecombe committee had gone into detail about it, should it be changed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, how will assisted area status be affected? It is of vital importance to various areas in Scotland, of which mine is only one. The Minister will see in the famous COSLA brief the reference to the proposed section 171B. I have a final question; I am truncating my argument. What about the joint venture agreements that concern the chartered surveyors? That is of considerable importance. I shall now wind up my remarks, but I am referring to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1083">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1959</span>
matters of considerable importance to areas in industrial Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish first to reassure the hon. Member for Linlithgow that the proposals in the Bill have no implications for assisted area status in Scotland. Secondly, I emphasise that we encourage local authorities to band together if they wish to do so in such matters. Many of them do so at present and there will be nothing in future to prevent them from continuing that process under the new structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That local authorities do a valuable job has been recognised by the Government. In our general services capital allocation, we regard industrial development and advance factory building—when it is sensible—as one of the highest priorities. I cannot accept the Opposition's amendment, nor do I accept the criticism that we are putting undue restrictions on the powers of the local authorities. As I said earlier, it is reasonable to have a power to ensure co-ordination in relation to overseas activities. That has been the case in Scotland. It has been part of our success with inward investment, which has been perceived by competitors. It has been recognised that we can move in a co-ordinated and swift way, which, of course, involves the partnership of local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The so-called restrictions in the proposed section 171A cover first the requirement to consult other parties. That is reasonable. Before taking action on economic development, we shall refer to local enterprise companies or chambers of commerce. I hope that that will result in a spirit of co-operation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that that will work both ways?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know, Sir James, that the reason why you were momentarily delaying was that you were reading the COSLA brief. That will allow me simply to precis it while making forcefully the relevant and valid point made by COSLA that this is yet another power taken unto the Secretary of State that should properly stay with local authorities—whether the existing or the proposed new authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know a little about tourism. I offer this information as a former member of the Scottish Tourist Board. I mention that before the Minister dredges out the research from Conservative Central Office. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] There is always an expert on tourism, as there is always an expert on education, because all of us went to school at some time, however little it shows. I shall not widen the debate unnecessarily other than to say that the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 gives local authorities discretionary power to establish area tourist boards. The vast majority of local authorities of whatever political complexion have done that. That is in the people's interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government undertook consultations about this part of the Bill and the overwhelming view of Scottish local authorities was that tourism should remain their responsibility, that they should continue to establish tourist boards and that they had a fundamental role to play. Consultation produced nothing by way of firm proposals in line with what the authorities advised the Government, so they now propose something entirely new, giving the Secretary of State yet more powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only that, bizarrely, one might have expected that, occasionally, and properly, even in advance of the legislation, the Secretary of State would consider how he would use the new powers under order. However, on 21
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1962</span>
March, he announced details of the new area tourist board organisation for Scotland. So not only is the Secretary of State taking new powers, he has taken them in advance and already announced where they will be deployed. I shall return to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notes on clauses disclosed information that has not yet been disclosed to anyone in Scotland, including the Scottish Tourist Board or the local authorities. The notes state:
	<br><q><p>"While … it would have been desirable for the schemes establishing the new Boards to have been prepared by the local authorities"—</p></q>
and we agree with that—
	<br><q><p>"it was concluded that, in practical terms, this would not be possible; prior to 1 April 1996, the new authorities will have neither the time nor resources to devote to this task."</p></q>
That is an intriguing concept. If the new authorities do not have the time to set up those schemes, where will they find time to set up education and social work departments and fire and police authority departments and take on all the areas of the regions whose services must be set up in such a short time span? We are told that they cannot take on tourism—hardly one of the most difficult functions—although they will be expected to set up everything else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The note on clause 158 blows the gaff on the Government's position on the Bill. We are going through an exercise based on a timetable that is no longer credible and which can produce a new local authority system only by inflicting immense damage on the services that Scottish local authorities must deliver to the public. I ask the Government to reconsider the amendments carefully with a view to accepting them and leaving this function in the hands of those who are closest to the issues and accountable to local people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall comment briefly on the way in which the orders have, in anticipation, been used by the Secretary of State. Two areas have made representations to members of the Committee complaining about the way that they have been treated. One is Clyde valley tourist board, which covers my constituency and the other is Forth valley tourist board, which has objected to the manner of the Government's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that this is not a suitable subject for debate tonight and that it may come before the House in another form. However, the Secretary of State has already made the announcement, but the proposal to add Clyde valley to Glasgow is illogical and impractical. It makes no tourist or management sense. I ask the Minister seriously to consider changing that proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking at a line drawn on a map, it may appear that there is an easy conjunction between the Glasgow area and Lanarkshire; Glasgow was once part of Lanarkshire—but for tourist purposes they are two different areas. It is almost a joke in some parts of Scotland to think of Lanarkshire and the Clyde valley as a tourist centre, but by innovation and imagination a tourist industry has been created from an area that was once one of Scotland's industrial heartlands, the remnants of which have now been demolished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of the new tourist industry has resulted from resurrecting the ideas of Scotland's industrial archaeology. There are a host of examples, the most obvious of which is the Chatelherault hunting lodge in Hamilton, an interest in which I share with the Minister. The lodge was saved
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1085">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1963</span>
for the nation by the last Labour Government, but—I pay tribute to the Minister and the Government—was transformed by the use of public funds into one of the jewels in Scotland's tourist crown. Much has been done there and I sincerely believe that joining the Clyde valley tourist board to greater Glasgow would not be a service to the Scottish tourist industry. I ask the Government to reconsider the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Forth valley tourist board said that the Forth valley and the Clyde valley tourist boards could be promoted as one. That would be a more sensible way of rationalising area tourist boards in Scotland than the Government's proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Tourism is the biggest employer in Scotland; it is a young, thrusting, vigorous, determined, vital industry and it is extremely important that we get these measures right. The hon. Member for Hamilton suggested that the clauses relating to tourism are a further example of the Government's resolve to cut local authority powers. That is not the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are determined that local authority powers should be used more effectively. To achieve that, we want improved co-ordination and closer partnership; evolving partnership is fundamental to the Government's approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We set about creating a 14-board structure within the framework of options suggested by the Scottish Tourist Board. The tourist industry will be given a competitive edge by a network that is sensitive to local needs and which delivers the effective marketing called for in the tourism review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We carefully considered the Glasgow and Clyde valley case, but we accepted the view of the Scottish Tourist Board that an urban and rural linkage made sense. Promoting part of the immediate hinterland with the city should increase the number of visitors to individual attractions. Visitors may also be persuaded to stay longer in Glasgow if they plan to visit the surrounding areas too. I was pleased to see that 	<i>Travel GBI</i> wrote of the islanders' delight. It stated:
	<br><q><p>"Tourist boards representing the Orkneys, Shetlands and Western Isles which between them had the loudest voices in the campaign to retain certain Scottish Area Tourist Boards as they presently stand, are 'delighted' with the news that their wishes are to be granted. Shetland Islands Tourism chief executive Maurice Mullay said that common sense has prevailed."</p></q>
John MacDonald, chairman of the Western Isles board was delighted. He said:
	<br><q><p>"All along we have been fighting to keep our own identity. I think over the past few years we have been going from strength to strength."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I, unusually, congratulate the Minister and the Government in respect of their acceptance of the many representations from Ayrshire that there should be an all-Ayrshire and Arran tourist board? There is now such a board; the enterprise company covers Ayrshire and Arran and so does the chamber of commerce—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And the health board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend says, the health board, too, covers that area. Does not that underline the importance of the Government rethinking their
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1964</span>
ridiculous decision to divide Ayrshire into three? Would not it be better to accept that the arguments that apply to tourism, industrial development and health apply equally to other local government services?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Each subject must be considered on its merits and judged accordingly, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr has done, most ably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 818 arises as a consequence of amendment No. 819 which introduces a distinction between members of an area tourist board and those who are subsequently appointed to its controlling body. As drafted, subsection (3)(d) makes reference only to the members of the board. Therefore, amendment is necessary to make it clear that the Secretary of State is appointing those board members who will serve as the initial members of an ATB's controlling body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition amendment No. 897 would delete the requirement that the Secretary of State appoints the first members of the ATB's controlling body. I can assure hon. Members that, in seeking this power, the Scottish Office does so only to ensure a smooth transition from the old ATBs to the new.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no intention on our part to impose an executive committee on an ATB. As the Secretary of State announced in March, we intend that the initial members of each of the new boards will be appointed entirely on the basis of nominations from the existing ATBs and from local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards Opposition amendment No. 898, I must tell hon. Members that they have misunderstood the intention behind subsection (4)(b). It permits, but does not require, an establishment scheme to include provisions as to who may be appointed as members of an ATB. It will be used to specify the types or categories of persons who may be members of an ATB. It does not have any bearing on who may be appointed to the controlling body. With that explanation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is significant that we have tabled amendment No. 819 to meet concerns about continuing local authority support for ATBs. The amendment goes a long way to meet the points raised by Opposition and other Members; it would allow local authorities to have, if an ATB so decides, parity of representation with trade members on the new ATB boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The balance between trade and local authority members varies among boards; some are trade led, others are local authority led, and, in an increasing number, trade and local authority interests have decided on equal representation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A response to our tourism review argued that ATBs will realise their full potential only if the full commitment of the private sector is secured. At the same time, we fully accept that local authorities are, and must remain, important players in the operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment recognises the legitimate interests of local authorities, while not detracting from the objective of securing increased private sector involvement. Parity of representation goes a long way to meet the points that have been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1086">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1965</span>
Our proposals are intended to encourage trade participation, while not diminishing in any significant way the legitimate interests of local authorities. There are numerous examples of good practice where the private sector has either parity or a working majority, even on ATB boards where local authority funding is completely dominant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal represents control in a minor way and is certainly not a restriction on local authority freedom. Therefore, I urge the Committee to accept the Government amendments and to reject the others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was initially pleased with the vigour and enthusiasm, if not delirium, with which the Minister began his defence of the importance of the tourist industry in Scotland. I agree with that. I believe that it is the most important, and certainly one of the fastest growing, industries in areas of rural Scotland such as the one that I represent and those that some of my colleagues on my party Bench represent. The Government are right to recognise that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fair to say that there was a general welcome for the Government's recently announced arrangements for the final dispositions to the area boards. However, there are still some problems. These involve the Clyde and Forth valleys, which were mentioned earlier, Argyll and Bute and some areas of the Highlands which are still in dispute with the Minister's announcement about the area boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the amendment, will the Minister give us an idea of the latitude for those areas that feel aggrieved for various reasons and the opportunities to make a case for reconsidering them before they are finalised in the course of the remaining proceedings on the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise the importance of amendment No. 819. The Minister was right to say what he did, but he did not go far enough to assuage the fears of the tourist industry and local authority members involved in the area tourist board in south-east Scotland about the scheme and the membership balance of the boards. The role of the membership-based organisations will be diminished because the Minister seemed to imply that, with regard to the appointments to be made by the Secretary of State, the method of nominations to the board was proposed not because the number of board members or the balance of interests would change significantly, but for the sake of convenience to get the transitional arrangements right. That is not my understanding of the Provisions, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will put me right if I am wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are fears in south-east Scotland that the nature of the membership will change. It will be regrettable if there is a huge influx of new business interests to the boards, rather than membership-based organisations. There are fears that local authority representatives who have served on the area tourist board in the Borders will be overshadowed, if not completely eclipsed, by the new membership system. Given that they are investing substantial sums of money—as they have been pleased to do—in the successful promotion of tourism throughout Scotland, not just in the Borders, they are right to raise at least a question mark over the Government's proposed membership scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new boards will have no accountability to the constituency trade members. Although local authority representatives may serve on the boards, there is no
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1966</span>
guarantee that they will. If they do, there is no guarantee that they will have any majority, or any control or oversight of the way that their funds are being spent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my analysis is correct, what prospects will there be for discretion for local authorities to continue to provide and participate in tourism services? Facilities such as the excellent Teviotdale leisure centre in Hawick not only serve tourist needs but provide a vital service for local people, where there are mixed interests in important public facilities that serve both tourists and local people, local authorities should be allowed to continue to have an interest, if not a controlling interest, and to continue the good work that has been done in south-east Scotland in particular and, I am sure, in other parts of the country as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need a clearer definition from the Minister about the role that he foresees for the local authority membership of the boards and its influence on the continued delivery of increasing and prospering activity in relation to the provision of tourism services in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to spend much time on this but it would be wrong to let the matter pass without paying tribute to those who operate East Lothian tourist board, which has done an excellent job and it is only a pity that it cannot carry on. If it is to be amalgamated, it is inevitable that it should be with Edinburgh. The tourist industry in East Lothian is inextricably linked to that in Edinburgh. Representation on those boards is extremely important. Clearly, a city such as Edinburgh will be the major attraction in that area; the board will be dominated by representatives from Edinburgh and there must be a risk that it would be content to leave the outlying areas of Lothian to rely on spin-offs from the attractions of Edinburgh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would not be good enough. There is more to the Lothian region than Edinburgh. At the last count, my constituency contained 16 golf courses and at least two more are under construction. There is the Scottish mining museum, John Muir country park and much more. We clearly need an assurance that there will be proper representation from the whole area so that fair attention will be paid to the outlying areas as well as the city in promotional activities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would understand it if this matter were debated under clause stand part, Sir James. I should like briefly to ask about the Government's response to the letter of 11 April from the chairman of Forth Valley tourist board, councillor James McGinley who stated that it was the unanimous view of the committee that any new area tourist board should incorporate Falkirk and West Lothian to ensure the continuation of the successful partnership to date. I would welcome a response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to answer the points raised by hon. Members. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire asked about the highlands. We believe that a single area tourist board for the highlands will bring many advantages, not least because it is a natural and strong marketing area. We understand the concern that its sheer size could lead to a loss of local input into decision making. As I said, appropriate arrangements for delegation of activity will be written
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1087">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1967</span>
into the scheme establishing the new board in accordance with the provision of clause 158(4)(1) to avoid such a situation arising. It will be for those involved locally to decide what would be the best internal structure of the new board. I am asking the Scottish Tourist Board to discuss it with them at the earliest possible opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister pay particular attention to the case that is now being made by Argyll and Bute?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Basically, the same principles apply. We believe that that is a natural area, which will be effectively marketed to the benefit of all those concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Lothian asked about Edinburgh and the Lothians. The STBs advice was that there would be benefits both to Edinburgh and the Lothians if they combined into a single board. We agreed that, as Scotland's capital, Edinburgh has a strong marketing image. In terms of visitor numbers, it is Scotland's foremost individual tourist attraction. Promoting the immediate hinterland along with the city should increase the number of visitors Lothian currently attracts. Visitors may also stay longer in Edinburgh to visit the hinterland too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that I made about delegation is particularly important. It will be possible to delegate activities to encourage local support and decision making. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire asked whether the appointments to the board were an attempt to exercise central control. It is purely a matter of ensuring that the ATBs are established by 1 April 1996. I can give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that initial members will be from local nominations. Thereafter, boards will decide their own future, including composition. Local authorities have an important continuing role. The hon. Member asked a specific question about the Forth valley and I shall write to him about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I right in thinking that it will be left to the boards to determine their size?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I hope to give the hon. Gentleman a complete answer in half a minute. The claim that our proposals represent an erosion or displacement of local control is a misunderstanding. The only proviso to the appointments will be that local authority representatives will not be allowed greater representation than trade interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our proposals are designed to encourage trade participation while not significantly diminishing the legitimate interests of authorities. They simply mirror the conditions in a growing number of area tourist boards, in which there is either a trade majority or equal trade and local authority representation. The provision is a very minor control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish Borders tourist board has established a strong and marketable image and the strong representations that we received convinced us that it should continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1968</span>
If I have the opportunity, I shall answer the question of the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire on clause stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give the answer to the hon. Gentleman's question, which the Under-Secretary would know if he had read the Bill. Of course, nothing is now to be decided by anyone but the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State will decide the size of the board. This is an amazing phenomenon. The point was left vague in the Bill originally, but the Government tabled an amendment to specify that power. That is the answer for which the Minister is looking to his civil servants, and which, presumably, he will eventually get. It will come as no surprise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman carefully examines the fine print of the Bill he will discover the answer to his question, which I have now had the opportunity to ascertain. The relevant provision is clause 158(3)(d), which provides that a scheme shall
	<br><q><p>"specify the minimum and maximum number of members of the board and provide that the Secretary of State shall appoint the first members of the board and that thereafter persons shall be appointed as members by the board".</p></q>
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Hamilton for his study of some excellent provisions in the Bill, which I strongly commend to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Here, to test the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, comes another piece of paper, which says that the Minister is wrong. A Government amendment is down on the amendment paper, which aims to change the provision that he has just read out. Dear me, I thought that I was only the shadow Secretary of State for Scotland. The answer to the question is that the Secretary of State will make the decision.—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I will give way if the Minister will read out another piece of paper and tell us that what he told us was unfortunately wrong, as he mistakenly read out the original version of the Bill, which Government amendment No. 818 will change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The scheme and the constitution will provide for the subscribing members and their number will be for the board. That is altogether appropriate and I strongly commend the Government amendment to the Committee as being altogether admirable and fitting in with common sense arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that the extract from the Bill that he read to the Committee is to be superseded by the words that amendment No. 818 would insert?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, of course it is. If the hon. Gentleman had been listening, he would know the answer to his question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has answered an Opposition Member by reading out a paragraph that is already being changed by a Government amendment—something that one might have expected him to notice. That shows how half-baked the whole enterprise is, but I shall not go over all the points that could be made about it.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1969</span>
I have a constituency point to raise about the matter. I am unconvinced by the Minister's arguments about why Clyde Valley tourist board should be merged with the Greater Glasgow board. The argument that there is a natural link between the Clyde valley and Glasgow is not tenable. That argument could apply east, west and north of Glasgow as well as to the south. The Minister may use that argument about the Lothians, because Edinburgh is bounded by the sea, but Glasgow is not. There is no logical reason for merging the boards. There is complete unanimity in the Clyde valley area for the continued existence of a separate Clyde valley tourist board. That support comes from the tourist trade, from all five district councils, which represent 500,000 people—under the Government's proposals that will increase to 630,000 people—and from the Lanarkshire development agency, the Lanarkshire economic forum and all the local enterprise trusts. The case is overwhelming and I hope that the Government will reconsider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke to amendment No. 819 with great gusto. It is yet another prescriptive idea, laying conditions on local authorities, which should be allowed to make their own decisions and, if necessary, their own mistakes and be accountable for them. It is unacceptable for the Government to take those powers for themselves. They do not need to do that. The powers could properly be left in the hands of local authorities. I recommend that we press amendment No. 896 to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am not in the business of criticising the Chair, but the selection list reads Government amendment No. 802, plus amendment No. 890, plus amendment No. 891, plus new clause 71. There may be some explanation, but I do not understand why amendment No. 890 appeared on the amendment paper, but was not selected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I called amendment No. 802. With that was grouped the amendments that the hon. Gentleman mentioned.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. I realise that all the amendments are making things difficult, but although you called Government amendment No. 802, I do not think that you said that with that it would be convenient to debate the other amendments. That is probably why my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow missed his cue. I appreciate that we have moved on from that, but would it be possible to find another opportunity to consider the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Every hon. Member is supplied with an amendment paper.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. Perhaps I can help you and my hon.

I draw the Committee's attention to the work that still must be done on the Bill and to the fact that no boundaries are firmly fixed for the new proposed local authorities. Several functions are still undetermined by the Government, despite the length of our proceedings in Committee. We cannot go ahead with such reorganisation along the lines of the Government's timetable. To do so would be an act of madness by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local authorities cannot possibly cope with the changes that will be necessary. A period of indecision will follow and such uncertainty will threaten not only those vital services produced and delivered by local authorities for the most vulnerable people in the community, but business and industry that depend on continuity, predictability and stability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government still believe that they can go ahead with shadow elections to the new authorities in April next year, they are in cloud cuckoo land. The Government are, however, used to living in such a place. The Bill was created there, but, unfortunately, other people must live in the real world in which they depend on local authority services being produced efficiently and effectively. Those services must be subject to an administration that people understand and can trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The transition to the reorganisation would have been bad enough at the beginning of the process, given the gerrymandering that went on and the bogus nature of the consultation. Now that we have gone on so long and are so far from completing the whole exercise, going beyond that without the detailed planning that is required will be costly both in financial terms and in terms of the services that local government delivers to people in the community. It will also be costly for jobs and profits. So many businesses will be affected as the Government try to drive this measure through on this impractical timetable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 169(2) will be used by the Government at some stage to retreat from the unmanageable timetable that they have put forward. If they do not do that, the damage that they will do to Scotland's economic and social fabric will be considerable. That is a small warning at the end of the consideration of the clauses before us today: the Government have brought forward a half-baked piece of legislation that will damage Scotland and do not one bit of good.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, does the Minister agree that the record offices provided by local authorities provide a valuable service and that they are much less well established in Scotland than elsewhere in Britain? What guarantees can be given that the new authorities would continue to provide a similar level of service?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, if the reply is that section 52 of the Bill provides certain guarantees, the answer is that those guarantees are twofold. One is the requirement to make proper arrangements, but that requirement is virtually worthless. That is already a requirement under section 200 of the 1973 Act and some existing authorities—Fife and Lothian—have taken almost no action. The other guarantee in section 52 is the requirement to consult the keeper. However, the new clause as currently drafted does not require the local authorities to heed his advice.

I know that it is the end of our deliberations on the Bill, but I have to say that the selection list is a dog's breakfast and it is difficult to know what is going on. That is not your fault, Sir James, nor is it the Clerk's—it may be the procedures of the House. It is difficult to follow the selection list. I suspect that under the well-established, procedures of the House, as the selection list puts new clause 60 with new clause 50, it should have been made clear that that is not being taken and as a consequence new clause 50 should have been slotted in with the other new clauses that the Opposition have tabled.

We are seeking to make progress, but we are finding it difficult because what is on the selection list to be debated is not always what we vote on because some items are held over from previous debates. We are also not clear which new clauses have been selected for voting on and which are again open for debate. Perhaps you, Sir James, and the Clerk could keep us aware of what is going on in case we miss some valuable point, thus causing considerable complexity in the remaining stages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

As I understand matters, we have dealt with several new clauses that are not on the revised list, which I received this afternoon. I did not mind, and I doubt whether other members of the Committee minded, going through new clauses that are not on the list but that had been dealt with before. However, we are now going on to new clauses that are not on the list and which have not already been dealt with. New clause 73 is on the list and you, Sir James are adding new clause 17, which is not on the list. With respect, I think that it is out of order to go on to a new clause that is not on the list, whether or not we want to discuss it tonight.

on a point of order, I shall listen to it, but I think that it might not be necessary at this stage as these matters will be rehearsed at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. Perhaps I may help my hon. Friends. We tabled new clause 17, to which the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire has added his name, to seek a guarantee that there would be no disconnections to water supplies. During that debate, my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central pressed strongly for that provision to be included in the Bill. The Minister agreed, under pressure, that he would bring forward a new clause—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Whether or not under pressure, the Minister agreed with my hon. Friend's case. New clause 17 was debated; it is now superseded by the starred new clause 73 which, I have agreed with the Chair, can be debated this evening, despite its star. Therefore, new clause 17 is redundant and will not be moved. I hope that my explanation clarifies the matter for all members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that clarification, but I hate to tell the hon. Member that I shall somewhat change the situation. I am deleting new clause 17 now, for the simple reason that I am instructed that it has already been debated with amendment No. 675. Therefore, it was accidentally and wrongly added to the amendment paper. But no harm has been done. There has been full expression about selection lists and that is always beneficial. No doubt what has been said will go Upstairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. I wish to put it on the record that the clock is now just after half-past midnight. We were first in this Room at 10.30 this morning—that is, 14 hours ago. If my calculation is right, this Committee has been sitting for eight and a half hours. These are most important matters and it is a giddy way to tackle serious issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know in your company, Sir James, that comments about masonic rituals are neither proper nor in good taste, but the procedures of the House take some understanding. I have often reflected on the fact that our job is perhaps the one job in this country for which no training at all is given. Lessons from experts in parliamentary procedures may pay dividends, as I found to my benefit last year, during the proceedings on another Bill. Of course, as a Lanarkshire Member, it is even more dangerous to make jokes about masons, but I recall a story, Sir James. There is a park in my constituency, Strathclyde park, where a lot of football is played on Sunday. One day, one of my constituents was walking in that park when he came upon a good football match; he asked one of the bystanders who was playing, and was told that the Knights of St. Columba were playing the freemasons. My constituent was duly impressed. 'Gosh, that's amazing,' he said. 'What's the score?' 'I'm afraid I can't tell you,' the bystander replied. 'It's a secret!' That story has come to mind as we have been going through the labyrinthine procedural Undergrowth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome new clause 73. It may seem strange that we welcome something from the Government in relation to water; nevertheless, we unambiguously applaud the fact that the Government, having listened to the arguments put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Fife,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2016</span>
Central, have introduced the new clause. My hon. Friend said to them repeatedly, with great cogency and effectiveness, that the relevant section in the Water (Scotland) Act 1980 was not enough to reassure people in Scotland that they would not face the problems that have been inflicted on people in England and Wales following privatisation. As a result of privatisation—and the prosecution of those with unpaid bills—some 56,000 people south of the border have had their water supply cut off. That number may seem a drop in the ocean when one considers the total number of consumers in England and Wales, but each one of those 56,000 people represents a tragedy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government were right to recognise the force of public opinion. The Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Dumfries may not have consulted many people before he came to Committee—he clearly did not consult the Leader of the House, who seemed shocked at hearing the news last week—but he should be congratulated for having risked offending all those right-wing bower boys south of the border who do not seem to consider the human tragedies caused by water disconnections. Perhaps he dared not consult some of his hon. Friends, even those on the Front Bench, lest they persuaded him that he was going about it the wrong way. In taking that decision, he was absolutely spot on. The new clause is not enough, on its own, to persuade people in Scotland that their water is forever safe in public hands—very few Government assurances can be treated with the seriousness with which they hope they will be treated—but it is at least a start and a signal improvement on the situation faced by so many people south of the border.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central and to all those who deployed strong arguments last time round in Committee to ensure that the law was reinforced. Alone in the United Kingdom, Scotland will have a prohibition in law against human beings' water supply being disconnected. More than 150 years of municipal control of water in Scotland has guaranteed fresh tap water and eliminated the public health problems that existed. That tradition will now continue, thanks to the generosity of the Minister—which, even if it is limited to the new clause, must be recognised. I hope that Conservative Members, especially those who are guests from south of the border, will recognise the service they have done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of them may want to leave now, and we may have to come to the Government's rescue to ensure that Scottish consumers are protected. The message will go out from the Committee and from the House of Commons, to all parts of the United Kingdom, that there are elements in the Government that are willing to recognise that it is an act of inhumanity to disconnect water supplies and that it goes against the grain of the tradition of public water supply in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 73 may take on some of the legendary qualities of the new clauses proposed last year when the House considered the Maastricht Bill, which almost brought down the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The message of new clause 73 will go out from the Committee. It is extremely welcome, because it will provide unique protection to Scottish people in their

homes. Its not the guarantee that we have sought, and will continue to seek, that water will remain under local, democratic control, but it will go some way towards reassuring people who believe that some of the worst excesses of privatisation that have occurred south of the border will be visited on Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend noticed that the hon. Member for Stroud, who is a vigorous supporter of water disconnections in England and Wales, has absented himself from the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting point. I have no doubt that when the shout goes out, the hon. Gentleman will come back into the Committee Room, holding his nose. Having voted for new clause 73, he might be holding his head for some time when his constituents realise that this enthusiast of privatisation and of disconnecting public water supplies has voted in favour of protecting the water supplies of the Scottish people.

On that unifying theme, I commend the new clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a Member for a constituency outside Strathclyde, I support my hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hamilton who, in his usual way, tried to stab me in the back with a screwdriver, was quite incorrect. I made it clear on the Floor of the House last March and last summer that disconnections of domestic water supplies would not happen under this Government, and I reinforced that point in my speech the other day. The new clause was drafted before that debate. There was no question of squeezing it out of the Government. It was my intention to introduce it and I am delighted that we were able to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that we need to go further. I am very glad to have the hon. Gentleman's support and to know that he agrees that it is an advantage to include this provision in the Bill. All in all, this is a useful new clause and it allows us to finish a long day on a note of agreement, as the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause deals with the voluntary sector. I thought that you should know, Sir James, that my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East and I will be at Wembley today, playing in a parliamentary football match against members of the Press Gallery. I thought it appropriate to include the ambulance service and the Red Cross in the new clause, because I may need the services of both at the end of the game. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I did not hear all of that sedentary contribution, but I am sure that it was polite and well meaning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 18 is designed to avoid the chaos that will ensue from the reorganisation. We have discussed the voluntary sector in Scotland and the £100 million that is given by local authorities, especially such strategic authorities as Strathclyde, Lothian and smaller regions. The voluntary sector's contribution is a vital part of the fabric of Scotland. We are merely asking the Government to take cognisance of the serious problems that they will face in a difficult period for public funding, and during the massive upheaval of reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would establish a committee, comprising people who have knowledge of the voluntary sector, to oversee the transition period. The Government may respond by denying that that is necessary, but many organisations in Scotland have been unable to make their voices heard during other stages of the Committee's proceedings because of the lack of clauses or amendments relating specifically to the voluntary sector. They want reassurance from the Committee and from the Government that there will be no chaos or funding crisis and that all concerned will make a determined attempt to ensure that their valuable work will not be disrupted by the reorganisation. We share much of the voluntary sector's concern about the Bill's implementation. Reassurance would certainly help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should like to move beyond reassurance to a commitment from the Government to a transitional process involving a committee. The new clause is well intended and the issue with which it deals—support for the voluntary sector—unites both sides of the House. Its aim is to provide reassurance and transitional security and to make it clear to the voluntary sector that the £100 million that is now secure will remain so at the end of the transition. That seems a small price to pay for continued success.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gave Mr. Stephen Maxwell, a representative of the voluntary organisations, an undertaking that I would ask the Minister whether there

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2019</span>
had been any detailed discussion of what would happen to the funding of many voluntary organisations in his region and mine—Lothian—after its unpicking. The voluntary organisations are very worried.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can reply briefly to the debate. A meeting took place on 4 March between my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State, the Member for Eastwood, and the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations, at which Mr. Stephen Maxwell was present. A constructive presentation was made about the effects on voluntary organisations of local government reform. A series of actions was suggested for consideration by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend agreed at the meeting that successor authorities must be made aware of the levels of funding devoted by the existing authorities to voluntary organisations. He therefore undertook that a direction would be made under clause 56(5) requiring authorities to inform the shadow authorities of all funding that is given to voluntary organisations by means of a grant, service agreement or contract. That direction will ensure that shadow and subsequent authorities will be aware of the full extent of existing authorities' funding of voluntary organisations and the level and purpose of annual discretionary grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad to report that guidance will be given to the new authorities in the shadow phase on the key role of the voluntary sector and the importance of avoiding disruption and delay in decision-making. Officials have been asked to ensure that the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations is consulted during the drawing up of the direction and guidance. In those circumstances, we consider that the new clause is unnecessary and that it would remove decision-making from the local level where it belongs. We cannot support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was again a disappointing response. The simple truth is that the Government will say that they want successor authorities to be informed by existing authorities. The logic is this: Strathclyde will be carved up into 12 reasonably smallish councils, with the exception of Glasgow and some Lanarkshire areas. Is it being suggested that in this crazy process, the full volume of finance that Strathclyde will contribute will be replicated eventually by the 12 authorities? One need hardly be a financial genius to understand that some authorities will perhaps do as much, and some will do less.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's reply was pathetic, and reassures no one. He must know that at the end of the transition process, the present funding of £100 million will be significantly reduced. Why cannot he at least accept the spirit of new clause 18 and come back with proposals for a committee or organisation that will see the process through? The voluntary sector does not trust the Government; it will not trust some successor authorities. The only way to reinforce its confidence in the process is to give it a share in the transition. That involves setting up a committee. The matter is far too important to press to a Division. We may wish to return to it in another place, and outside. With some disappointment, we shall not press the new clause to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise the lateness of the hour, but this is a specially important issue that deserves far better consideration than it will get at 12.50 am.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of our schools are in a disgraceful state. Many are suffering from rain and draught penetration, windows on the verge of falling out, paint that is peeling and rotten wood—all because the local authority system is fundamentally underfunded. We propose that the Government make available to local authorities sufficient money to maintain school buildings in a wind and watertight condition and introduce health and safety regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish for even better conditions because those are the minimum that we should expect. Not only do we inhibit our children from learning because of the physical conditions in which they must work, we give them the wrong message about the value that our society places on education. They realise that adults are prepared to allow them to be educated in rundown buildings in poor conditions, while the majority of public houses, bookies' offices and new buildings are freshly equipped and in far better condition than their school buildings. All this gives them a clear steer about what adult society believes is important; it does not include education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have, in recent years, created a legacy of neglect in capital spending on education and building. That has been partially responsible for the way that many young people are alienated from the education system. Accepting the new clause would give the Government an opportunity to try to redress the balance. Local government reorganisation will undoubtedly bring about enormous other pressures on finance, such as pressure to squeeze care and maintenance budgets still further, thereby exacerbating the crisis over capital for school building. It is therefore important that the Government accept our new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can answer the hon. Gentleman briefly. Education authorities are already under a duty to ensure that buildings are in a healthy and safe condition. The new clause would require the Secretary of State to make capital funds available to authorities, but that is not how the capital allocation system operates. Under the present arrangements, authorities can allocate their resources according to local needs and priorities. I am sure that they would not welcome any move to fetter their choice under a more rigid funding framework.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know what the hon. Gentleman is about to say. He is going to object to the fact that North Berwick high school has not been given more funds. The answer is that Lothian region has allocated the funds according to its priorities, and he should direct his efforts towards the council. He has raised that matter previously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Authorities currently raise their own funds for school building work, usually by borrowing. My right hon. Friend's role is restricted to setting broad overall limits on authorities' capital expenditure, but within those limits they have considerable freedom. We believe strongly that this system should be retained and that the new clause is inappropriate and unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister could have saved himself and his colleagues a few minutes if he had given way to me. He is right: I am very concerned about the condition of several schools in my constituency, and all my hon. Friends could, no doubt, say the same. I recently read an inspector's report on Mussleburgh grammar school, which stated that, once the Government allow Lothian regional council to spend the money, parts of the accommodation urgently need to be upgraded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recently visited the Knox academy in Carrington, where there is water coming through the flat roof, as happens with flat roofs generally. There is an inadequate allocation of capital resources to enable such buildings to be upgraded. The Minister is correct; just up the road from where he lives is North Berwick high school, where a large number of pupils are being educated in temporary units that are more than 20 years old. We have just heard him saying again that that is all the fault of the local authority. He knows perfectly well that the local authority cannot spend resources on the capital upgrading of buildings without getting capital consent from the Scottish Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not good enough for the Minister to pass the buck to local authorities. If they had the capital allocation they would get on with the job but as he knows, the capital allocation is hopelessly inadequate. It is the fault of his Department and his Government that there are so many crumbling, dripping schools in Scotland with rain coming in through broken windows and roofs. This is an important point, which he should address seriously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am appalled by the worst of many bad answers that the Minister has given. I found it particularly offensive that he smirked with satisfaction when he said that the problems were the fault of local authorities. We all know that local authorities are underfunded by the Government. The Minister should be aware—if he is not, he is incompetent—that the Government control the amount of capital allocated to local authorities, and that year on year they underfund them. That is why schools are in their present state.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should also know that in Strathclyde, for example, there are 800 primary schools. There is enough capital to rebuild only two of them each year, which
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2022</span>
means that, on average, each primary school must last 400 years. Even the Minister should grasp that modern building methods and the methods that were used when the schools were built cannot make primary schools last 400 years. It is gross irresponsibility and sheer dishonesty to blame the local authorities and to suggest that it is simply a matter of prioritisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can have a bit of knockabout occasionally in the course of political debate, but the Minister does the Scottish Office a disservice when he tries to fob the Committee off with such an explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should not try to generate more heat than he can contain. Substantial resources are made available. Capital allocation in 1991 stood at £56 million. In 1993–94 it was up to £79 million, and this year it amounts to £72 million. Against the tight public expenditure settlement, that is a significant total. However much the Government provide, the hon. Gentleman will always ask for more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures I cited are not an upper limit. Authorities are free to supplement this from a number of sources, including capital receipts and by funding capital from the substantial revenue funding available to them. There is always the possibility of supplementary allocation during the year. Further to that, there is the possibility of rationalisation of schools to ensure that specialist provision goes as far as possible. It remains a fact that in some areas, rationalisation, sensibly and sensitively applied, could result in better use of the significant capital resources.

I reject the hon. Member's arguments. They are wholly incompetent and divorced from reality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
