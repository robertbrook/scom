	<div class='page-header'><h1>Local Government etc. (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>[Continuation from column 1724]</p>
	<p>9 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming—</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are debating the subject of the make-up of the customers council that would reflect accurately the needs of customers of the water boards. If a body is to represent properly, it must itself be representative. The possibilities are endless. I have selected community councils and elected councillors as a shorthand way of allowing a broad cross-section of the Scottish population to participate, and allowing an extra dimension of responsibility to community councillors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The community councils wish to extend their role. They feel that they do not have enough to do. I am sure that they would be happy to take on the extra responsibility of reflecting local needs directly to the water boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for the addition of councillors is self explanatory. They are already elected individuals who reflect their communities' needs. Any committee worth its salt should elect its own chairman, as is usual practice in organisations with which I have been connected. It goes against my grain for chair persons to be foisted on organisations by outside bodies, although the Government seem to have taken to themselves too great power with all-too-evident relish. Clearly, the customers council should be allowed to choose its chairman. I hope that the Government will see it that way; so far they have not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no quarrel with the other amendments, which would add specific representation for consumer affairs, rural areas, and disabled persons. Disabled persons have special needs which only they can reflect to the new water boards. I hope that the Government will consider those representations. I trust that my amendment would allow all those interests to be represented. Given the organisations that I have chosen, my amendments should be inclusive rather than exclusive. It is not meant to exclude groups mentioned in other amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What would be most unacceptable is a so-called customers organisation which the Secretary of State controlled absolutely, appointing its chairman and members from persons who appear to him to have relevant experience. That would be another unacceptable aspect of the centralisation that the Government are imposing on the water boards and associated organisations through the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like input to come at long last from other nongovernmental sources—people either elected by their fellow citizens or with other well-established local
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1726</span>
credentials. The Government have cosseted the water boards taken them to one side, pushed them through in the Bill, and made sure that they are created in the Government's image. I cannot see why the Government cannot allow some decentralisation and local input into decision making for the customers council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment, and those grouped with it, make a plea to the Government to allow local input. They have centralised, and taken control of water through the Bill. If they intend a customers council to be truly representative of local and consumer interests, they should look kindly on the amendment, accept it in both its spirit and content and, at long last, perhaps concede some point to the Opposition, which they have not done so far on an issue that transcends party politics as a method of reflecting consumers needs. I commend the amendment and hope that the Government will find it acceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak briefly about the three amendments that I have tabled. I support the remarks of the hon. Member for Angus, East. Amendments Nos. 668, 436 and 437 seek the same objectives as amendment No. 279. More input into the council is needed from those who have direct and relevant experience and knowledge of consumer affairs. Provisions for that should be more explicit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 437 would ensure that the majority of the members of the council represented domestic consumers and that the interests of rural and disabled consumers were represented. Real and urgent problems need to be tackled. There is no evidence to suggest that the Government have examined the problems that rural consumers and consumers with disabilities will experience. Several medical conditions require the services that the water authorities will provide. The circumstances in rural areas are especially relevant to hon. Member's who represent rural constituencies. There are many difficulties in supplying services to rural areas. The Minister will appreciate that because he represents an area that is similar to ours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. He is from Corstorphine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: People from Corstorphine are soft city dwellers. They do not realise how hard life can be in the provinces.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share the hon. Gentleman's anxiety about rural communities. I took the Scottish Landowners' Federation to see my hon. Friend the Minister. Will the hon. Gentleman join me in welcoming Government amendment No. 619, which recognises rural consumers and other potential customers? The amendment acknowledges a broad customer base.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point. The amendment does not provide the assurance that we seek, but I acknowledge that the Scottish Landowners' Federation made positive and robust representations to the Government. I did not know that the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside had taken members of that organisation to see Ministers. I am pleased to hear that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: People power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a strange definition of people power. I acknowledge what has been achieved so far. However, the Committee would like to hear more about the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0957">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1727</span>
thinking behind Government amendment No. 619. I ask the Minister to examine the problems that face people who live in rural areas. Perhaps he does not have as much experience as the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Dumfries. The problem of private water supplies should be tackled. We shall not have sufficient time to examine the matter in detail this evening because we wish to make progress. However, it would be helpful if the Minister commented on the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to reinforce the points made by the hon. Members for Angus, East and for Roxburgh and Berwickshire about domestic consumers. Amendment No. 437 relates to rural and disabled consumers. It is important, in considering the composition of the customers council, that the Government make it clear that all domestic customers should be represented. Opposition Members have already spoken about the rural aspects, and I shall not repeat what they have said, but fears about water and sewerage services for disabled consumers go well beyond the fears about electricity and gas. Experience of the privatised systems in England and Wales is valuable. Although there is a distinction to be drawn between the three super quangos to be established in Scotland and a privatised water system, groups representing disabled consumers have expressed great concern about disconnections and the intolerable burdens that are placed on disabled people by direct metering of water services. We shall deal with that in a later clause, but many anxieties beset Scottish consumers, and I am sure that the Government will want to reflect on the serious purpose of the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am fascinated by Goverment amendment No. 619, which provides for appointees to look after other customers and potential customers. It is difficult enough for any organisation to look after its established customers, but I am intrigued that the interests of potential customers should be represented on the customers council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Export customers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an interesting point, because it is clear again that non-domestic and domestic services are being covered. The amendment, rightly, covers the business community, which includes major users of water. It is right that a customers council should represent them, but a balance has to be struck according to where the main problems will be encountered. We are worried that large industrial consumers' interest in the quality and cost of the delivery of water will be based on a strictly financial point of view. Domestic consumers' interest will be based more on health and other social aspects, so there is a danger that conflict will arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must give the Committee some confirmation about the balance of advantage between competing groups in the context of Government amendment No. 619. He must also define what is meant by a "potential" customer, especially when it comes to planning representation on the customers council. I hope that the Minister will clarify those points when he responds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to raise one or two points on which I seek enlightenment from the Minister. I do not think that anyone understands the process by which the Government will pick the members of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1728</span>
the water boards, so will the Minister give the Committee some detailed information about how people will be picked for the customers council? That is very important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the council will be an important part of the regulation of water services and one of the paths of communications between the customer and the Government quangos. Other Opposition Members have said that the quangos will be so distant from people that there will be no way to contact them, although we have been told that Members of Parliament will be able to go through the Scottish Office and that the Secretary of State for Scotland will pass matters on. We need to know more of the detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred this morning to the article in the 	<i>Yorkshire Post</i> on what has happened with Ofwat. That is very important example. Members of Parliament in Yorkshire have been very involved in the problems arising with English water services and have expressed deep anxiety over the decision by Ian Byatt, Ofwat's director general, to sack the chairs of the regulatory body in certain areas and to appoint what the 	<i>Yorkshire Post</i> article terms an "old boy network". The article states that he has
	<br><q><p>"appointed people to regional consumer protection jobs who include his best friend and golfing partner, a construction company director whose firm has received contracts worth millions and the wife of his former close colleagues at the Treasury."</p></q>
They were all appointed to Ofwat to act, theoretically, as regulators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many hon. Members have been involved in this matter. They include my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, South (Mr. Gunnell) who has expressed deep concern and called for the resignation of the director general of Ofwat. I hope that the hon. Member for Leeds, North-East (Mr. Kirkhope) would support that. I will give way to him if he wishes to express an opinion on such an important matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That case throws a laser beam of light on the process that we are considering. The Minister has proposed a customers council to act as a regulatory body, but we do not know anything about how it will be chosen. We have no guarantees that a director such as the Ofwat director general in England and Wales will not be appointed to pick people on the basis of personal knowledge such as old school chums and even relatives of people he has worked with in Government Departments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Have we not already had an idea of the sort of people who will be chosen in Scotland? It will be jobs for the boys and girls. They include people such as the ubiquitous Deidre Hutton, who seems to be on all such bodies, John Corrie, Aileen Bates—[Hon. Members: "Elsie Menzies".] If Elsie Menzies were appointed, it would be a good appointment. However, the authorities will be made up of people such as Aileen Bates, Deidre Hutton and others who never get elected. They are appointed because they are friends of Conservative Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is very perceptive. The Minister owes the Committee, the House of Commons and the people of Scotland a detailed explanation of how the process will work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The director general of Ofwat is allowed to appoint up to 15 people. Will the Minister tell us how he will structure appointments to the customers council? That is the only direct regulation that customers will have. They will not get
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0958">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1729</span>
that through the Secretary of State. The Minister has assured us that the customers council is an important matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case that the article describes, no criticism was made of Diana Scott, the former Chairman of Ofwat's Yorkshire area until 1980, but she was sacked because she took the post as chair of another organisation—a regional television viewers' panel. She was sacked because the post conflicted with her regulatory role on behalf of the consumer and customer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister about to tell us that similar cases could take place in Scotland? Could someone such as Jim Gardner, Mr. Byatt's best friend at school, be appointed to the council in Scotland? Would that reflect customers' needs? Elizabeth Monck, who is the chair of the Thames Consumer services Committee, is the wife of Mr. Byatt's close friend at the Treasury. Will the Government allow such people to be appointed to the customers council, and is that the structure to be proposed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of that damaging report, the Minister should tell us how he plans to structure appointments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central for drawing our attention to the fascinating terms of amendment No. 619, which refers to
	<br><q><p>"other customers and potential customers."</p></q>
It would be useful if the Minister could explain what the Government have in mind by "potential customers". It is like putting the Prime Minister of Malaysia on the customers' list of the Overseas Development Administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are well intentioned, but are they worth it? The schedule would create a customers council of between eight and 12 members who will be appointed by the Secretary of State to scrutinise the work of water authorities, which will also be appointed by the Secretary of State. That is incestuous. The Secretary of State will appoint the customers council to monitor the Work of other people. It will be a national body, so it is an upside down way of doing things to create a tiny joke clique, appointed by the Secretary of State, to cover the entire nation of Scotland and to represent customers on the three new super-quangos.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the parallels. Every now and then it is perceived that consumers or customers feel aggrieved and so there needs to be a figleaf to make it look as though the Government are doing something about that. I submit that the health councils have not been a resounding success. In fact, the Government have gone to great lengths to weaken them so that they are no longer local health councils and are much more remote bodies. I doubt whether many consitituents are aware of where their offices are, let alone who are meant to be the representatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure whether there is a Gas Consumers Council. If there is, I doubt whether it is cutting much ice. The Transport Users Consultative Committee is chaired by the former Conservative Member for Cunninghame, North, Mr. John Corrie. It is not the most suitable body to represent the interests of the travelling public in Scotland. Such pseudo-consumer bodies are not credible mechanisms for safeguarding consumer interests in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does the hon. Gentleman think that someone such as John Corrie is not suitable to be involved in the Transport Users Consultative Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1730</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not saying that he is not suitable, but I am suggesting that he is not the first person whom one would think of as a suitable representative of the Scottish travelling public. I would not be a suitable person to represent the travelling public in Scotland because it is a long time since I last used the Glasgow underground. I wonder whether Mr. John Corrie has.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are going off on a tangent; we are supposed to be dealing with the water customers council. However, I cite that as a parallel of thoroughly inappropriate appointments when the body does not function properly. The same is happening with this body. It is a figleaf that is not worth establishing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be interested to hear from the Minister what powers he believes that the customers council will have. Apart from access to information, will it be able to affect the decisions of the board, or will it be ignored? Let us take the example of fluoridation. If there is a proposal to fluoridate the water, what role will the customers council have? If it comes out unanimously for or against something, will that affect decisions? If it wants to make recommendations on the level of charging, will that affect the decision on charging, and if so, how? I can think of few issues that would animate debate more than its power over charging or fluoridation, but I want to hear from the Minister the detail of how that process would operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The customers council is a waste of space. It has been introduced simply as a sop to give the pretence that there is an independent authority. The Minister gave the game away when he suggested earlier that it would have a place in the chain of command, which is the phrase that he used when discussing the entire structure. All the organisations—the boards and the customers council—will have a place in the chain of command.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people appointed to those organisations will be drawn from the same categories. There will be councillors, experts, failed Conservative candidates and those who answered the adverts in the papers who were not good enough to become failed Conservative candidates. All of them are the sort of folk whom the hon. Member for Ayr said cannot be councillors because they have better things to do with their time than meet constituents, but they still wish to have power to exercise influence over spending public money. Such people will serve on the customers council. We cannot have much confidence in them. Where is the evidence that the Government are prepared to listen to consumers? It is clear that people in Scotland do not want the change. The Government have listened only to the Scottish Landowners' Federation, which would like cheap water in rural areas. I do not know how that will be reconciled with the boards' obligation to operate commercially. If they are to operate commercially, there will be an onus on them to ensure that expenditure is balanced by income for each class of consumer, unless the market is to be rigged to benefit one specific group—people in rural areas. If so, rural areas will be subsidised by urban areas. My constituents will subsidise rural areas. Will the customers council play a part in that balance of cross subsidy? The provision is vague, woolly and a waste of space. We should reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to respond to the points made by hon. Members. Amendment No. 279, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Angus, East,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0959">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1731</span>
would provide for the Secretary of State to appoint members from those nominated by the Scottish community councils, and for each local authority to appoint one councillor. The amendment would enable the customers council, rather than the Secretary of State, to appoint one of its members as chairman and another as deputy chairman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition amendments Nos. 578 and 591 are alternatives. The former would provide for one-third of the members of the customers council to be drawn from local authorities, and the latter, for half the members to be selected from local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 668 would require all appointments to be made by the Secretary of State on the recommendation of local authorities. Amendment No. 436 would require the Secretary of State to appoint members who had knowledge or experience of consumer affairs. Amendment No. 437 would require the majority of members of the customers council to represent the interests of domestic consumers, and representation of the interests of rural and disabled customers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very reasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the hon. Gentleman says: he will hear my comments in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The functions of the customers council is to represent effectively the interests of the consumer. We want it to take full account of the needs of all consumers, not simply particular interest groups. It should take account of the interests of all consumers, including those in rural areas, disabled people and every other category.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And potential consumers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is impatient. I shall come to that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The needs of each consumer group will not always coincide. A principal function of the customers council will be to achieve a reasonable balance between competing considerations and to negotiate with the authorities with a single, powerful voice. The role envisaged for the customers council would exclude amendment No. 437, which seeks majority representation from domestic consumers. The customers council should represent all consumers. If accepted, the amendment would label the council as a domestic consumers' lobby.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the customers council is to represent all groups of consumers; its membership will need to cover all relevant interests. Therefore, membership needs to be drawn from those who, by experience and interest, are capable of appreciating the whole range of consumer circumstances and problems. The Scottish Office always intended to secure that necessary balance. Such a balance would have been achieved by the Bill as drafted. However, we are persuaded that there is merit in spelling out the provision more clearly in the schedule, and that is the reason for tabling Government amendment No. 619.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for East Lothian and for Fife, Central asked about potential consumers. That category covers people who are not currently connected to the water and sewerage services but who may become customers as the systems are extended or as new developments and houses are built on green-field or brown-field sites and are connected to the systems accordingly.

Perhaps I should clarify what clause 64(2)(a)(ii) in Government amendment No. 619 refers to. It is a reference to Government amendment No. 616 which includes among the interests that authorities and the Secretary of State must take into account that of discharging their duties to rural consumers. That covers the hon. Gentleman's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the council be responsible for private supplies and septic tanks?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The council will have a say regarding septic tanks. The exact functions are covered in the schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Govan asked about the council's powers. It is designed to be an important and persuasive voice on behalf of consumers. It has the powers to get the required information it needs, and will play a crucial role in scrutinising and proposing approved schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) asked about membership. The Secretary of State will appoint members with relevant knowledge or experience who are not members or employees of any of the new authorities. The hon. Gentleman also mentioned Ofwat, the Office of Water Services. An independent economic regulator would be inappropriate for the regulation of public water authorities. These bodies are ultimately responsible to the Secretary of State and, therefore, to Parliament. Rurual and urban interests will certainly be borne in mind when membership is decided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point was not who would be appointed but how they would be appointed. In the Ofwat situation—and I am not suggesting that we should have such a body—the appointment by the director general has now occasioned him to pick his friends. Is this an assurance that the Secretary of State will retain the power to appoint his friends?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Basically, these public bodies will be accountable to the Secretary of State and thereby to Parliament. A different system applies in England, obviously, because of privatisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point relates to complaints. The customers council—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I shall not pursue that point, as the hon. Gentleman is not interested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Govan asked about fluoridation. The health board must consult authorities and the customers council before requesting a water authority to carry out fluoridation. The decision then rests with the water authority, and the views of all those consulted will be relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I strongly believe that amendment No. 619 covers many of the points that have been raised in the course of this debate—[	<i>Interruption.</i>].</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not responsible for the Ministers replies, but I would like to hear them from time to time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will excuse me if I did not pick him up correctly on this point. I understand that there is an overall charge in the highlands—it may be free in certain remote areas—to have septic tanks collected once a year, or whenever. What is the Government's policy about the future costs of septic tank collection in remote rural areas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those who have septic tanks at present are not connected to the public sewerage system. They are paying through their council tax for sewerage services which they do not receive. Existing local authorities do not usually levy septic tank charges except when emptying services are provided more often than the frequency stated. That can vary from one to three years. The Tayside charge for all emptying is usually £19. After restructuring, only those connected to the public sewerage system will pay, so septic tank charges will be contained in the charges schemes and be subject to approval by the customers council. The customers council will play a key role, which is what the hon. Gentleman wanted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that the water authorities have the discretion to have one free emptying under current legislation? Would that still exist?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The frequency can vary from one year to three years; there may be variation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Linlithgow mentioned the highlands. Statements of local authorities' present charging policies for septic tank emptying can be made readily available; I can make them available to the Committee if necessary. It is important that the customers council plays a key role and it will certainly do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made matters worse for himself. It was difficult enough to take the schedule seriously in the first place, but in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central and to me, he has said a little more about who the potential customers are, making it clear that he is talking about developers. Barratt, Wimpey or Miller, major housing developers, will be directly represented on the customer representative body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendment No. 619 is clear enough. It states that the appointees shall
	<br><q><p>"include persons appropriate to represent…customers and potential customers".</p></q>
The Minister has identified that specifically as developers. The consumer representative body may have as few as eight members for the whole of Scotland, one of whom will represent Miller, Barratt or whatever. How can we take the matter seriously?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it Government policy that septic tank charges be equalised?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have tried to give hon. Members some leeway, but that does not have anything to do with the make-up of the customers council. Does the Minister want to reply?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very briefly. After restructuring, only those connected to the public sewerage system will have to pay. A point was made about developments; all developments are covered, even new council houses in the constituency of the hon. Member for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1734</span>
East Lothian. I have visited the hon. Gentleman's constituency and there are a few new council houses, as well as many others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Roberston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I am answering the hon. Gentleman for the second time. New developments are covered and it is necessary that the water and sewerage system should respond to new developments throughout Scotland as and when they arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Roberston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A very important point has been made by the Minister with responsibility for housing. If he is giving capital consent to East Lothian district council to build council houses, we have heard the most important announcement from a Minister for a long time. Please tell me more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Please tell me more, too. It is important to people in rural areas to know whether the policy in the new situation is that septic tank charges shoud be equalised. People in remote areas will incur a great deal of expense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is just coming.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is improper. Schedule 9 is about the make-up of the customers council. The hon. Member for Linlithgow is discussing an operational matter. If the answer is coming, it will not come just now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister gave us a resume of the amendments followed by a total rejection of them, which has become par for the course. He gave us no reasoning or logic, only Government diktat. That has been the Government's attitude throughout. The Minister made a general, pious statement about representing everybody rather than specific interest groups, but he gave no indication of how that would be done. It is all to be left to the Secretary of State alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were told that Government amendment No. 619 would spell matters out more clearly. Surely the Minister was kidding. Has he read that amendment? Once again, matters will be left to the Secretary of State. It is another example of Government diktat. Who are the customers and potential customers? How would they be represented?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question boils down to whether the Government want true consumer and customer representation. Is Government amendment No. 619 a sop that was introduced at the last minute, as the hon. Member for Govan said? Or will it do something positive for customer representation with the monopoly water boards? Those monopoly boards will command a daily essential service, and will consist of a very few people. We are dealing with the last line of defence for the general public against the Government's centralisation of power, which has been their purpose throughout the Bill. The Government have created the three water boards as quangos, and now intend to control them with another Government appointed quango. It is a wonder that the Government bother to have elections, although they may be next to go if the results do not suit the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 279 would guarantee at least a real method of widespread representation. It would reflect accurately the sentiments of local communities in a general way through the use of community councils and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0961">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1735</span>
councillors. How would Government amendment No. 619 reflect geographical and individual group needs? The Minister has not told us. How would it serve the needs of the disabled, for example? They are especially vulnerable. Their needs should be met with goodwill and energy. The Minister has not explained how that will be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Fife, Central about metering. That debate is still to come, but the hon. Gentleman was right to lay down a marker about the general anxiety about water provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendment No. 619 proposes a duty to represent, but it does not clarify who will be represented or the basis on which they will be chosen. The amendment contains no definition of "customers" or "potential customers", nor does it specify the mechanism for representation beyond stating that decisions affecting the lives of people throughout Scotland will be left—yet again—to the Secretary of State alone. A major fault with the Bill is the degree to which central powers are to be taken by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 619 reaffirms more centralisation of power, and poses more danger in the use of unelected and unrepresentative people. The Minister must think again. The other amendments give him the opportunity to reflect customer interests more truly. They represent the last line of defence. The Government will set up boards to do the Government's business. The boards will be packed with Government placepersons. Their meetings will be held behind closed doors, and now we discover that the customers council will act in the same way. There is very little democracy in the Government's proposals, and very little attempt has been made to represent ordinary people. The amendments offer the Government the chance to reflect accurately the reality of customer's needs and wishes, but I suspect that, as usual, those needs and wishes will be ignored.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 669, in page 133, leave out lines 31 and 32. I can dispose of this amendment quite quickly. For the Secretary of State to bother himself with the appointment of the chairman and deputy chairman of the customers council seems out of keeping with its work. Its members will be what the hon. Member for Linlithgow would call serious people, so why the dickens can they not be trusted to elect a chairman and deputy chairmen from their number, without the assistance of the Secretary of State for Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is no doubt possible to conduct a lengthy debate on the philosophical merits of the democratic election of a chairman as opposed to other methods. We must recognise that the precedents affecting such a body are on the side of the legislation as it has been drafted. It is better for the chairman and the deputy chairman to be clearly appointed by the Secretary of State. They would have a clear remit to get on with the council's job. That would be understood by council members and the water authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that the Committee should know whether the chairman and deputy chairman of the customers council will be paid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know how much. The remuneration and allowances of members of a body that will represent consumers are important matters. They will reflect member's responsibilities and will be determined by the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must have some idea—a ball park figure, as they say—about members' and the chairman's and deputy chairman's remuneration. Can he suggest what kind of sums we are considering? Will it be a fiver, a few thousand pounds, £10,000 or £50,000?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The exact arrangements for comparable quangos will be considered.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister, who is as well balanced as usual. Earlier, we were discussing the boards that are to run the massive water authorities. We are now discussing the customers council, which, while important, will have a lesser role. It sounds from what the Minister said as if even the members let alone the chairman and vice-chairman, of the customers council are likely to be paid more than local councillors—perhaps even more than chairmen of local authorities. Will the Minister tell us the sort of figure that he is talking about, because we have no idea whether it will be a small attendance allowance or a substantial four or five figure sum? The Minister is in a powerful position and ought to have such information at his fingertips.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's question is premature. Appointments have not yet been made. Furthermore, if we wrote a specific sum into the Bill, it would rapidly become out of date and the Bill would have constantly to be amended. The issue will be properly and fully considered and we shall look hard at the precedents of other bodies, such as those on which the hon. Member for Hamilton served. We shall use those precedents as examples and form an appropriate view of what is suitable in the circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not it the case that the Minster does not want to have a long debate because he has only a short brief and no answer, and that, despite the fact that the boards and consumers councils have been discussed in Government for a while, the issue of pay has not been considered? I refer the Minister to the reference by the hon. Member for Angus, East to monopoly boards. We are discussing monopoly money. The Minister will pluck a figure from the air. I think that I saw civil servants' heads go together earlier to work out a figure that they could pass the Minister in a note for him to announce. I hope that he will be able to announce a figure before the end of this evening's sitting, so that we can go back and tell people who will be considering whether to put their name forward how much they are likely to get. It is important for people to know whether such people will be paid more than elected councillors, many of whom have enormous responsibilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give us information about mileage allowances? As there will be only one customers council for the whole of Scotland, a considerable amount of travelling will be necessary. What mileage rate will be received by members of the customers council? Will it be the same as that for Members of Parliament or for local Authority councillors? Clearly, there will be a glaring injustice if it is not at the better rate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is wide of the amendment. Other parts of the schedule mention pensions and allowances.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why should not a committee of responsible people elect their own chairperson? We have not received an explanation on that. If the Secretary of State chooses the people, they will obviously be responsible and will be experts in their own fields. However, they will not be thought capable of democratically choosing one of their number to become chairman. According to the Bill, the Secretary of State will be the busiest man in Scotland.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is far too much conversation in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State will probably be the busiest man around. He will have yet another reserve power under which he can take decisions behind closed doors.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1738</span>
Does the schedule mean the Secretary of State or, in reality, the civil service? Will the Secretary of State personally consider all the appointments?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problems have been caused by the Government's timetable. They are rushing the legislation through too fast. They cannot trust outside organisations or people to reach decisions. In a democracy, they should have some say. However, because of the rushed timetable, the Government cannot afford extra time. Therefore, the Secretary of State will have the decisions in his pocket and he will make them as quickly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a rushed and ill-thought-out Bill. The Government should be ashamed of themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall reply to the hon. Member for Govan. The chairman, deputy chairman and members of the customers council will be paid under paragraph 6(1) of schedule 9. The level of remuneration is to be determined by the Secretary of State, with the approval of the Treasury. It is still far too early to say what those levels will be, but a careful study of the duties involved will be carried out. The remuneration paid to members of more or less comparable bodies will be studied and taken into account. From that process, fair and realistic levels will emerge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to the remarks of the hon. Member for Angus, East, we are following precedent. The appointments will be made on merit. As the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To avoid doubt, I wish to correct a misprint on line two of amendment No. 610. It states:
	<br><q><p>"the first two for the eastern water area and the western sewerage area".</p></q>
Of course, it should read the first two for the eastern water area and the eastern sewerage area. That is confusing for members of the Comittee who have studied the amendment. East means west unless otherwise stated. That is the type of language to which parliamentary draftsmen are accustomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment can be dealt with expeditiously. It argues that three committees for the length and breadth of Scotland are not enough. We need twice as many committees—six, not three—to bring local knowledge to bear. If the bodies are to be successful, they must be familiar with the detail of their own localities, which vary from place to place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 610 is a probing amendment to make the Government consider a system that is much more responsive and sensitive to local variations in the need for water and sewerage services. It is well founded. Originally, it was suggested by the Scottish Landowners Federation. Its ideas are right, in my view, and the Government would be well advised to look in detail at the amendments and support the principles behind them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was with some disappointment that I learnt that the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire did not want three committees for the west of Scotland and only one for the east. I was about to ask him how he would justify that to his constituents, but he had a good reply before I could ask the question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, we do not want to increase the number of committees. A better spread in membership would allow better representation. That is why we tabled Government amendment No. 620. There is also merit in retaining the influence of the Secretary of State in the appointing of chairmen of the area committees and, as with the council itself, in retaining a large measure of flexibility for the council to appoint committees as it sees fit. I acknowledge also the merit in importing more specification, as our amendment No. 621 would do. I hope that it meets the concern of the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The schedule as drafted would allow only expenses to be paid to committee members. Given the functions that area committees will have to discharge, I believe that it is right to draw short of having salaried members. The committees will not be the types of bodies that will or should, require members' full-time services. There is merit in encouraging a spirit of public service. I accept, however, that members of area committees should not find themselves out of pocket by reason of their willingness to render public service. Hence our amendment No. 622, which permits the payment of allowances for loss of remunerative time. I hope that I have met another of the hon. Gentlemen's concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 440 would require area committees to hold public meetings. The amendment does not specify how many meetings should be held. No doubt the hon. Gentleman accepts that it would be unrealistic to require all meetings to be held in public. However, we feel it right that there be a requirement that each committee hold at least
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1740</span>
one public meeting a year. In practice, I would expect them to hold many more public meetings: a statutory requirement here would give the right signal. In view of my explanations, I call on the Committee to accept Government amendments Nos. 620, 621, 622 and 623 and reject the other amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

all right because they could choose their chairman; however, the Government now say that that choice will require the approval of the Secretary of State. We have returned to the issue of centralisation. The whole thing is a sham. I should like to place on record my opposition to schedule 9.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to refer to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Govan. I agree with the hon. Member for Angus, East, that the proposal is the most ludicrous way of representing water consumers' interests. What about travel expenses? The council will consist of
	<br><q><p>"not fewer than eight, nor more than, twelve persons"</p></q>
and will represent customers' interests, including potential customers' interests, for the whole of Scotland. How much travelling does the Minister expect those people to do? What rates will they be paid? Will they have their own helicopter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is covered in the schedule. It states:
	<br><q><p>"such remuneration as the Secretary of State may, with the approval of the Treasury, determine".</p></q>
The hon. Member for Angus, East is wrong to say that the council is a sham. It is an important customers council. It will consist of persons with the greatest skill, experience and expertise, who will further the interests of all consumers. The hon.

	<div class='title'>FUNCTIONS OF THE CUSTOMERS COUNCIL</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 385, in page 55, line 19, at end insert
	<br><q><p>";or</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(c) any matter which affects the interests of customers or potential customers".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take the following amendments: Government amendment No. 617.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 386, in page 55, line 22, at end add—
	<br><q><p>"(6) The Customers Council shall have a duty to inform and educate customers and potential customers about any matter appearing to it to affect the interests of customers or potential customers.".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subsection (4) of clause 66 states:
	<br><q><p>"The Customers Council shall advise the Secretary of State on any matter which appears to the Council, or to him, to relate to—
	<ol>
	<li>the standard of service provided by a new water and sewerage authority to their customers; and</li>
	<li>the manner in which any such authority conduct their relations with their customers or potential customers."</li></ol></p></q>
Those are narrow definitions. Amendment No. 385 would extend the scope for comments by the customers council by adding a paragraph (c), which would include
	<br><q><p>"any matter which affects the interests of customers or potential customers."</p></q>
There is no point in setting up a water authority composed of hand picked people and then establishing a customers council—also hand picked—to monitor that water authority. The Bill limits severely the power of the customers council to oversee and comment on a water authority's actions. It is quite clear that the customers council should be allowed to comment on more wide ranging matters and that it should not be so severely restricted by clause 66.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 386 would give the customers council the duty to inform and educate customers. That is a reasonable proposition. I am sure that the Government would not establish a customers council that could not spend money on its role in disseminating information and providing education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would strengthen the powers of the customers council. Those powers amount to an ability to contribute to ongoing discussions within a major industry which will spend up to £1 billion, if not more, in each of the next few years. The amendments also highlight the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0965">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1743</span>
inadequacy of the Government's proposals in the clauses relating to the customers council. As one of my hon. Friends said, it is ludicrous to place the Secretary of State in a pivotal position where he can hire and fire everyone connected with the supply and distribution of water in Scotland. It is ridiculous that we should be discussing the Secretary of State's power to send letters to groups of people authorising them to run the water authorities and the customers council when that Secretary of State is merely offering a package put together and tied up by a discredited Government in whom customers in Scotland have very little trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government would go some way towards meeting some of the more cynical and contemptuous criticisms made by Opposition Members if they were to give the customers council some powers when—and if—this crazy Bill is enacted and the council set up. It is equally important to allow the customers council to spend money to educate and inform, because this is a complex area. We are worried about the Secretary of State placing his own men and women on the customers council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend speaks about educating and informing customers. Would that include making the excellent case for including fluoride in the water supply?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises an important subject, which I am sure must be covered by one of the more useless clauses of the Bill at which we have not yet arrived. If my hon. Friend bides his time, that important and non-controversial topic can be addressed later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any Government who want seriously to address this matter would adopt both amendments, because they make common sense. I am sure that we want common sense to prevail and that the Government will readily accept the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would place a duty on the council to advise the Secretary of State on any matter affecting customers and amendment No. 386 would give the council a duty to, inform and educate customers. The customers council will already have a specific duty to report on two key areas—the standard of service provided by a water authority to its customers and the manner in which it conducts its relations with customers and potential customers. That duty will give the council's operations a clear focus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The council will also have a general power to keep under review all matters that appear to it to affect the interests of customers and potential customers of a water authority. The Bill will not prevent any findings that the council may reach during such considerations being put before the Secretary of State. I assure the Committee that the Secretary of State will pay close attention to any representations made to him by the council upon relevant subjects. The customers council will already have all necessary powers and duties and nothing material would be added by the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister for Dumfries, met the Scottish Consumer Council and was persuaded that there was scope for the council to have a specific power to make arrangements to inform customers and potential customers
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1744</span>
of relevant matters. Government amendment No. 617 seeks to achieve precisely that. I hope that that will satisfy the hon. Minister for Fife, Central and I recommend the Committee to reject the amendments and to accept Government amendment No. 617.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:: When the Minister met the ubiquitous Deirdre, was it suggested that there should be conducted tours of the East Calser sewerage works? If that is part of educating the customer, my hon. Friend the Minister for Linlithgow is an ideal candidate for membership of the customers council. Will there be trips to hear the shouts of "Gardyloo" on the Fourth? I understand that Strathclyde uses Garroch Head and the Dalmarnock to deposit sludge in the Clyde. Is that what the Minister means by the education of customers and potential customers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not suggesting that there will be an obligation on the customers council to show schoolchildren around sites. I have visited the sewerage works beside the docks in Edinburgh. I was extremely interested to see the efficient and effective process undertaken there, and astonished at the lack of smell involved in the process. Scientists were carrying out experiments to ensure that poisons were not being concentrated above the proper level and the river purification boards were working extremely effectively. Overall, Scotland has a good record in maintaining a high standard of water, although we are conscious of EC regulations. In answer to the hon. Gentleman the general duties already exist and there is a general power to keep under review all matters relating to consumers' interests—schoolchildren as well as everyone else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that when he visited the sewerage works in Edinburgh, there was no noticeable smell. Is he willing to talk to the people of Greenock and Ayr and explain that to them? There are many misconceptions about sewerage works. People think of them as being as they were decades or even centuries ago, but modern ones are relatively well-designed, inconspicuous and quite pleasant. They do not normally emit smells. I would be grateful if the Minister would confirm that from his visit to the Seafield sewerage works in Edinburgh. The Minister has not yet dealt with the question of sludge boats—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Sewerage works and sludge boats are not relevant to the amendment. They are the responsibility of the local authorities and will be a matter for whichever authority takes over.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask the Minister about amendment No. 385 which seems to go wider than the Government's proposals. I want clarification about whether, in the Minister's opinion, the customers council would have the right and the responsibility to come in on any scheme of, say, land disposal or on a policy being developed by any board to restrict access to the land owned by the board. I am not clear whether, under the Government's phrasing, the proposal is intended to refer to consumers' interests as consumers of water only, or whether it extends to their wider interests as users of the land facilities owned by the water authorities. Accepting amendment No. 385 would help to ensure that that wider responsibility was covered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) should not be reading a newspaper in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a useful ruling, Mr. Martin. I regret that English Tory Members see fit to read newspapers in the Committee which is discussing major matters of interest to consumers in Scotland. Many of my electorate will be distressed to hear that one of the English Members takes such little interest in the debate that he can read a newspaper during it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have now given the Minister sufficient time briefly to consider the matter, and I would be grateful to hear whether the wider interests can be considered by the Scottish Consumer Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer the hon. Gentleman to clause 66(4)(a) and subsections (4)(b) and (5) which give a complete answer to his question. The duties and powers are comprehensive and cover the situation completely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to the Scottish Consumer Council and to discussions that were held. A briefing statement just published by the Scottish Consumer Council, says specifically that amendment No. 385 explicitly gives the council the power to advise the Secretary of State on any matter which affects consumers' interests. There is a wide recognition in that comment that the current powers in clause 66(4) are simply inadequate. The detailed wording of subsections (4)(a) and (b) shows that the Secretary of State expects comments on the standard of service. Does that include any possibility of disconnections? Does it include the costs? Clearly, there will be consultation on charges, but how widely is the standard of service to be extended? Subsection (4)(b) refers to
	<br><q><p>"the manner in which any such authority conduct their relations with their customers or potential customers."</p></q>
What is the definition of "the manner in which"? Does that range wide enough for the customers council to be able to give proper consideration to the multitude of issues that will affect consumers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far, the measures do not satisfy the Scottish Consumer Council and certainly do not satisfy Opposition Members. It is quite clear, no matter how subsections (4)(a) and (b) are interpreted, that they are very tightly drawn. That must give credence to the view that not only is the Secretary of State tying up all organisations in the water and sewerage industry, but is trying to gag them by ensuring that they do not have any statutory responsibilities to range beyond service standard and the manner in which such authorities deal with customers. That is inadequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have rejected the spirit and the detail of both our amendments and it would serve little purpose to force them to a Division. 	<i>Hansard</i> will show that the Government are not interested in giving the customers council real powers.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause is about the power of the customers council to require information.

In the event of a dispute over what is a reasonable request, the matter would be referred to the Secretary of State. To undertake its duties properly, the customers council will need access to certain information held by the new authorities. It is right that the council should be able to obtain such information and the new authorities must make it available.

How can the Government set up such a complex apparatus to oversee the water and sewerage industry that has nothing in it that is not part and parcel of the water authorities? One cannot set up a customers council and pretend that it has independence if the very people that it is to monitor are to foot the bill for its operation. That would be odd. I am getting pained looks from the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart); perhaps he is trying to tell me that, at this late hour, I may be confused about what is happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is designed to ensure a better financial relationship between what are, admittedly, similar parts of the same conspiracy against the consumer. It nevertheless makes little sense to have the water authorities and the customers council financially linked. The amendment therefore requires the Secretary of State to defray the expenses of the customers council. I shall not press amendment No. 429 because, to a connoisseur of technical matters, it might be slightly in conflict with amendment No. 592. I do not want to confuse the Committee any more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 602 merely seeks to delete the part of the clause that makes the customers council dependent on the water authorities. I hope the Minister will rectify what we think is a very unsatisfactory financial relationship.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are dealing with the funding of the customers council. The amendment removes the need for the Treasury to consent to the sums paid by the Secretary of State; that would be contrary to the usual, long-standing rules and practices for the exercise of such powers. Our proposals allow the Secretary of State or the new authorities to fund the costs of the council. The Secretary of State will fund the council before April 1996,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1748</span>
but after that we envisage that the authorities will be the source of funds. That means, in effect, that the customers of the new authorities will contribute to the costs. In other words, those whose interests the council represents will pay for its operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also our intention that the customers council will be funded by a levy on the new authorities in due course. The level of contribution will be determined by the Secretary of State, who will give the authority a direction to that effect. There is no question of an authority being able to use its levy payment as a means of influencing the customers council in any way. It is very important that the customers council is truly independent of the new authorities. The amendment would add nothing to that aim and I invite the Committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the council is to be truly independent, it must have a feeling that it is not beholden in any way. If that is wrong, doubtless the Minister will point out why. One gets the impression that it will have a sense of being beholden—as one is always beholden to paymasters, whoever they are. What is the Government's answer to that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The customers council will not be beholden in any sense. It will be entirely independent. It is healthy that, under the terms of the previous clause, annual reports will be published and the facts will be out in the open.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is ridiculous. My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow referred to the relationship between the water authorities and the customers council. The council cannot retain any degree of independence and freedom of action in relation to costs if its primary concern is its paymasters. That makes no sense, even to an impartial observer of these proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister give us a definition of the levy? Are the Government suggesting that they will ensure by regulation that a water authority will not be able to escape from providing an appropriate level of finance to the customers council by ignoring real needs and refusing to defray the costs if it does not like the look of the council? If there is to be a levy system, will it be designed and implemented by the water authority, or will the water authority operate under a levy system imposed statutorily by the Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That could not happen, because the Secretary of State will give directions concerning the level of charges. It will not be the authority but the Secretary of State who decides the charges. That is laid down in subsection (3), which refers to
	<br><q><p>"payments of such amounts, and at such times, to the Council as the Secretary of State may direct."</p></q>
The situation is covered and there is no question of an unhealthy relationship brewing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May we have further clarification? Is the Minister saying that, under the Bill, the water authority will be directed to provide an adequate level of funding to the customers council, regardless of the practical relationship that may develop between a water authority and the customers council? That must be made crystal clear. Our concern is that an unhealthy and unworkable relationship could develop, where the paymaster is, in fact, the water authority. Will the Minister give us an assurance that the Secretary of State will direct—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that mean that, regardless of the relationship between the customers council and the water authority, the Secetary of State will determine, without equivocation on the part of the water authority, the sum to be given to the customers council to enable it to undertake its work? Do we have a categorical guarantee that, on that basis, the water authority will be unable to manipulate, change or reduce the figure that the Secretary of State determines?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is yes. The Secretary of State will have those powers and will give those directions. He will require the charges to be as he directed. That is covered by subsection (3).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the objection to the Secretary of State defraying all the costs of the customers council? The money must come from somewhere. It is all very well for the Minister to deny that the relationship is unhealthy, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central pointed out, the customers council will represent the interests of customers and potential customers. It should therefore be totally independent and be seen to be independent of the new water and sewerage authorities. The Government cannot pretend that that is a healthy relationship.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is covered in the Bill. Subsection (1) states:
	<br><q><p>"The Secretary of State may, to such extent as may be approved by the Treasury, defray or contribute towards the expenses of the Customers Council."</p></q>
That is what the hon. Gentleman wants to be in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again we have reached an impasse. We have been assured that the water authorities will be unable to reduce or deal with the customers council on the basis of how they find them rather than how competent they are. That does not go as far as the alternative suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow—direct funding from the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that customers, through the water authorities, should pay for the customers council and policing of the authorities. There is some logic in that, but it will worry consumers that the organisation that is under scrutiny by the customers council will be contributing to the welfare of the customers council. Nevertheless, on the basis of what the Minister said—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] My hon. Friends are more cynical that I am. I am flexible and malleable and, being a democrat, I was thinking about asking to withdraw the amendment, but perhaps we should put the matter to the test to see whether any Conservative Members have the courage at this late hour to support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take new clause 53—	<i>Supervision by Commissioner for Local Government Administration in Scotland—</i>
	<br><q><p>'.—In section 23(1) of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1975 (Authorities subject to investigation), after paragraph (d) there shall be inserted the following paragraph—
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>"(dd) The new water and sewerage authorities within the meaning of the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994;".'.</li></div> <!-- ul --></p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately, the new clause cannot be supported as it would not be appropriate for the new water authorities to be subject to the Commissioner for Local Administration. The new authorities will not be part of local government; they will be separate from it and procedures designed for local government should not necessarily or automatically be applied. Nor would it be appropriate for the new bodies to come under the Parliamentary Commission for Administration. The new authorities are being set up to conduct their affairs along commercial lines and bodies which so act are not to be brought within the commissioner's scope under the terms of the Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967. We are convinced that there will be an adequate and thorough mechanism through the customers council for the investigation of cases by the new authorities. That will be particularly so given the proposed duty on the new authorities to produce codes of practice dealing with customer relations and to have them agreed with the customers council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I invite the Committee to reject the new clause. Clause 70 speaks for itself and I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that the clause does speak for itself. I do not know whether any colleagues have shared my experience, but I have been in front of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission which is, incidently, an extremely impressive organisation. Along with the Amalgamated Engineering Union, I appeared on behalf of the Atlas steel foundry in Armadale. Has the Bill been discussed with the MMC? If so, what did it say? Its members are serious people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1751</span>
	<p>11.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a brief comment. I listened to the Minister's response to what seems a reasonable amendment. He said that such matters will be supervised on behalf of consumers by a body appointed by the Secretary of State, who will even appoint the chair and vice chair of the council. That it will not be subject to regulation by an ombudsman is an example of the deepest fascism in Government. No one can do anything about the organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The authorities cannot be referred on as the development department of the Scottish Office was referred by, I believe, a constituent of the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Eastwood, about the dumping site in his area. Three examples of maladministration were found. The quarry was called the Pilmuir colliery and was referred at the demand of the constituent, who has now died. At least there was some way in which to regulate or supervise that section of the Scottish Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing bodies that will take over two of the most important functions in Scotland—water and sewerage. There will be massive expenditure of at least £5 billion during the next 15 years. They will not be subject to scrutiny by any organisation. The Secretary of State is taking on the attitude of some sort of Politburo head in the Soviet Union under the Stalinist regime. We all applaud the removal of such a system, yet we are recreating it in miniature in Scotland. The Secretary of State commends such action to the House of Commons. He should be ashamed of having anything to do with it. He seems always to portray himself as a man of reason, as do other Ministers in the Scottish Office. In fact, they are nothing but the lapdogs of the ideology that smacks of dictatorship and centralisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This part of the Bill is truly amazing. We have just finished dealing with clauses that will establish a quango to be nominated by the Secretary of State to supervise on behalf of the consumer another quango to be nominated by the Secretary of State. Why do we not cut out the middle man and leave it to the Secretary of State to do the whole lot? That would be the honest thing to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister told my hon. Friend the Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire that the quangos cannot even by subjected to scrutiny by the ombudsman. What protection will there be for the citizen who suffers from the consequences of maladministration on the part of the quangos? I realise that the ombudsman cannot provide much of a remedy, except to say that maladministration has taken place, get that on the public record and put moral pressure on whoever is meant to operate the service to do something about it. The Minister has now said, however, that not even the ombudsman can intervene. The only person who will have sanction over the administration of water and sewerage services in Scotland on behalf of the Secretary of State in future will be the Secretary of State. Can that be real?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister extend his remarks in the direction of other potential methods of bringing scrutiny to bear on new water authorities? Will the Public Accounts Committee or the parliamentary commissioner have roles to play? The Secretary of State plays a major role
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1752</span>
in relation to the appointments and so, and I assume that he must be subject to the scrutiny of the parliamentary commissioner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must be some other avenue. If the Commissioner for Local Administration is not the appropriate person, surely, the new provisions in the Bill must be subject to some oversight. Otherwise, the position will be totally unsatisfactory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire asks a fair question. In the first instance, customers will be protected through the customers council which has been strengthened by Government amendments, including new clause 54 which we discussed earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked whether the Public Accounts Committee could be involved and I understand that the answer is yes. Clause 70 has been discussed with the Department of Trade and Industry and its importance is that water authorities will operate in what, to all intents and purposes, is a monopoly. Therefore, it is right that there should be the further safeguard of a provision for a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission should there be any suggestion of that position being abused. Section 11 of the Competition Act 1980 applies to, among others, corporate bodies supplying goods or services by way of business, the affairs of which are managed by their members who hold office by virtue of appointment by a Minister under any enactment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new authorities fit broadly into that category and it is right that they should be brought withing the scope of that section which deals with potential references, where appropriate, to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the remedy of last resort for a consumer who feels aggrieved about actions taken contrary to natural justice? I suppose that there could always be an application for a judicial review, but what is the avenue of last resort in those circumstances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister answered a question that I did not ask. I asked whether he had discussed the matter not with the Department of Trade and Industry but with the MMC. That is a semi-independent body and I suspect that there could be real problems for an MMC operation in this instance. If the answer is no I would understand it but I should have thought that it would have been wise to have those discussions before Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister deal with that matter because he is taking powers from consumers? At present, if a customer believes that there has been maladministration, the local government mechanism allows the local authority ombudsman to be the court of last resort. The Bill would take away that power, so with what will the Minister replace it? The ombudsman provides a specific remedy of last resort but to whom would maladministration be referred under the Government's new system?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that customers may go to the customers council, which is a court of first resort for normal complaints, but what if it proves to be insufficient? Will the new customers council have the staff, resources and back up to conduct such investigations? The ombudsman's department has them as well as the experience of following through on cases of maladministration. We are discussing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0970">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1753</span>
undue bias, delay and so on and the Bill would take away existing rights of consumers. Will the Government replace them with adequate and equal rights?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is very simple. The powers reside with the Secretary of State who is accountable to Parliament. If there is an abuse in relation to a monopoly position it can be referred to the MMC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Linlithgow asked whether there had been discussions with the MMC. Primary discussions were held with the Department of Trade and Industry. I cannot tell the hon. Gentleman what further discussions the DTI had, but it is the Department with overall responsibility for the MMC, so it is appropriate that it would have discussed the subject. The clause is competently drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends have asked a number of serious questions that the Minister has failed to answer. He could probably answer a question that puzzles me. Why is there only one monopolies commission?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is useful to have only one body to deal consistently with all the applications. I note that in Scotland if someone appears in court and is given a more severe sentence from one judge than he would have from another, there are complaints. Judges now try to get some consistency. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission applies the same standards and principles to each case. The last resort will be the customers council and the Secretary of State. The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley should appreciate that the local government ombudsman is also appointed by the Secretary of State. The customers council will be a powerful body and the relevant powers for the Secretary of State are written into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister cannot be let off with that. The customers council will be accountable to the Secretary of State and all its members can be removed as well as appointed. They do not have to run their term—they can be discarded any time that they cause the Government disquiet on how they perform their duties. In the case of the boards, that might be because they are not proceeding in the way that the Government wish in implementing a scheme, or by not giving the private sector enough of the action. There are many reasons why they could be dismissed, which may be commercial, and it could happen that they could be referred to the Monopolies Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of the customers council, which will similarly be appointed by the Secretary of State, members can be dismissed at any time for any reason. He may not like what they are saying on behalf of the customer. That would not be a commercial matter and would have no relevance to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. If something is going on within the operation of the boards—the water and sewerage departments—that is not a commercial matter and has nothing to do with the MMC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire asked why the local government ombudsperson does not have the right to interfere or to investigate the matter. We are told that it will not be a part of local government and we accept that. The second question was why it would not be within the remittance of the parliamentary ombudsman. It must surely be referred to someone if it is not a commercial matter or if it is a question of something that offends the customers council that has not been taken up by that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1754</span>
council because of its fear of the Secretary of State's wrath. Members of the council could be removed from what might be a lucrative position. They may be well paid and the job may carry expenses that are tantamount to writing blank cheques for journeying round Scotland looking at water and sewerage plants. Those are relevant matters, so why cannot the parliamentary ombudsman act in that respect? The customers council could be seen as an appointed subsection of the Secretary of State's Department. It will be his creation, which is a matter of great concern to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The parliamentary ombudsman does not have the sort of powers that some of us would like. In the Pilmuir quarry investigation, there were three counts of maladministration. We believe that that has not been given a public airing because the Member of Parliament who submitted it was the Minister responsible for the development department that was found guilty of the maladministration. Although no great powers would be involved, we want a Member of Parliament to be able to refer on behalf of the customer or constituent to the ombudsman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not said why the ombudsman is not allowed to have a remit. We have established that on a noncommercial matter but on a matter of policy, there is no recourse to anyone. Why will not the Minister accept new clause 53? Will he explain how a customer, who cannot have satisfaction through the customers council because council members are afraid of the Secretary of State dismissing them from their appointment, can appeal and why is the parliamentary ombudsman not allowed to act in this respect? The Minister owes us an answer before we accept his explanation of why he is not accepting the local government ombudsman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I always fascinates me that hon. Members should attribute to the Secretary of State much greater powers than he in fact has. The hon. Gentleman should read page 129 of the Bill which makes it clear that my right hon.

	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 600, in page 56, line 30, after 'recover', insert 'directly or indirectly'.</p>
	<p>Government amendment No. 618.</p>
	<p>No. 382, in clause 73, page 58, line 32, leave out 'endeavour to'.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clauses 71, 72 and 73 relate to charges and schemes for charges under the reorganised water and sewerage system. There will be widespread dismay at the dismantling of the current water and sewerage authorities because there will be uncertainty and fear in Scotland about the future at a time when domestic and industrial consumers are anxious about their budgets, about their factories and shops and about the services that they provide. Never could any Government have picked such an inappropriate time to introduce such a half-baked measure. It is worth making that point time and again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments relating to clause 73 deal with the charges for domestic consumers in particular, but amendment No. 384 deals specifically with undue preference being shown and the need to ensure that there is no undue discrimination in the fixing of charges. If the Government change from a system that is widely respected and efficient to the one proposed in the Bill, many consumers will be fearful of what may happen under the three super-quangos which will operate at a practical level well out of reach and beyond the understanding of most people. The discussion on clause 70 was amazing. The Government and the Secretary of State can set up quango after quango, yet refuse to accept the basic tenets of democracy in relation to ombudsmen
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1756</span>
and others. It is against that background that there is massive concern about the imposition of charges for services. Amendment No. 384 aims to get the Government's views on the crisis that will engulf the transition period and to discover how we can safeguard against the three super-quangos doing what they want when they want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are in an unusual position. In England and Wales they have had the courage of their convictions. With no dishonesty, they have gone for straight privatisation and the marketplace in which the consumer is all-powerful, at least until the perks and share options for the chief executives, chairmen and directors are considered. That is an honest attempt unashamedly to follow an ideological path. I commend such honesty. In Scotland, 12 accountable, efficient and non-corrupt authorities provide some of the best water in a way that is close to domestic and industrial consumers. Therefore, two systems operate—the privatised system and the local authority system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scots Tories do not have the guts to move toward privatisation at this stage because of public opinion. They temporarily reject privatisation as an option in order to allay the public's fears. That results in a dog's breakfast of a Bill and a water system that does not satisfy the ideologues who are happy with the English experience. The hon. Members for Ayr and Tayside, North expressed honestly their views about the privatisation model. That does not exist in Scotland, but the Government will not leave well alone and allow the local authorities to continue and to secure the investment about which we hear so much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would try to make the best of a thoroughly bad job with the three super-quangos. People will be worried that charges for all aspects of the service can be set by those who are accountable to no one except the Secretary of State who, in turn, is linked tenuously to pubic opinion in Scotland or to the parliamentary processes in the House. The amendments are probing amendments to discover whether the Government will reassure us and domestic and industrial consumers that all will be well under the new set up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill does not permit water and sewerage authorities to charge for laying mains water pipes and sewers. Amendment No. 600, which stands in my name, would prevent authorities recovering indirectly from individual consumers the costs of laying mains and sewers by making higher than usual charges for water supplied by new water mains or special sewerage charges to recover the costs of installing a new public sewer. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment, or assure us that those circumstances will not arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to respond to the debate, but not to the provocative remarks with which the hon. Member for Fife, Central introduced the discussion. Opposition Members have caused anxiety in Scotland. It is disappointing that they have raised all sorts of hares and scares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments deal with charges. Amendment No. 384 seeks to ensure that no undue preference or discrimination is shown in fixing charges. Clause 73 already contains such a provision, which covers charges schemes. Government amendment No. 618 introduces the same requirement for charges that are fixed by agreement. Amendment No. 384 would extend the requirement to charges other than those fixed by a scheme or by agreement. In practice, those charges are trade effluent charges for which the Sewerage (Scotland) Act 1968 makes detailed provision, including a right of appeal to the Secretary of State. Those provisions are best left as they are. They have developed over time and they work. Government amendment No. 618 is drafted in terms that extend the scope of those provisions to cover charges that are made by agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Caledonian paper mill, one of the largest employers in Ayrshire, uses a tremendous amount of water, probably more than any other consumer in Scotland, and it has a specially negotiated charge. Any substantial increase in that charge could create tremendous problems for the Caledonian paper mill and be a consequent threat to jobs in Ayrshire. Can the Minister provide an assurance that the Caledonian paper mill will be able to negotiate the same terms and the same sort of contract that it currently has with Strathclyde region for providing a huge amount of water?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, major consumers such as the Caledonian paper mill or ICI in Grangemouth, will be able to negotiate with the water authority the charges that they will have to pay. A large consumer will probably receive a reduction in cost because of the quantity of water that it uses. Trade effluent is of concern to major industrial complexes in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 600 tackles a different issue. It seeks to ensure that the infrastruture charges that exist south of the border are not applied in Scotland. There, developers who join a system pay not only the cost of bringing pipes and sewers to the point of reasonable connection with the public system but an entry fee, as if to reflect a share of the cost of the system that they join. I reassure the Committee that neither current legislation in Scotland nor the Bill permits such a charge. Clause 71(4) ensures that. Our intention is not in doubt. The Secretary of State would not hesitate to use his power of direction if any loophole was discovered in the Bill. I am glad that the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire raised the issue because it enabled me to clarify matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise to the hon. Members for Fife, Central and for Roxburgh and Berwickshire that the amendments that they tabled are not necessary. I would not wish them to press the amendment to a vote. If they did, I would have to vote against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Much of what the Minister has said about commercial charges does not deal with the wider issues of uncertainty over the transitional period and the

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 383, in Clause 72, page 57, line 15, at end insert—
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>'(3) It shall be the duty of the Secretary of State to publish any order made under this section in such manner as he considers appropriate for the purpose of bringing it to the attention of persons likely to be affected by it.'.</li></div> <!-- ul -->
Amendment No. 383 would impose on the Secretary of State the duty to publish, in a much more expansive way, the details of any regulations that he proposes for the attention of those likely to be affected by them. That brings us back to the question of consultation. Amendment No. 383 is a response to the rather casual approach in clause 72(1), which provides that the Secretary of State may fix charges
	<br><q><p>"from time to time by order".</p></q>
The parliamentary draftsmen must have been getting slightly bored with the Secretary of State appearing in every clause and have changed the wording to spice up our debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is designed to find out how willing the Secretary of State would be to publish the orders more widely before they are debated in the House. Clause 72 deals with charges and when commercial concerns are involved, people should have the right to be consulted. The Secretary of State should not be able to make regulations or orders to be debated in the House at any time of the day or night when people outside are not aware of the consequences, especially when bottom-line commercial issues may be involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sympathetic to some of the points made by the hon. Member for Fife, Central, although in my view the amendment adds nothing to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause requires any order which the Secretary of State may wish to make regarding the maximum resale price to be contained in a statutory instrument, which will be laid before both Houses and subject to annulment by resolution. At that point, the proposed order will become public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman says, quite rightly, that that is not enough. However, publication will not make it certain that affected parties are aware of the order. That must be done, and it will be done by other means, such as directly informing affected parties in specific cases and disseminating information in general cases via the water

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1759</span>
authorities or the customers council. That will be an important function for those bodies to perform. I therefore invite the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 593, in page 57, line 19, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>'and payment of any specified charge will include the right to connect to the sewer.'.</p></q>
The amendment raises an issue which was certainly prevalent during my time as a local councillor in Fife—that is, the right to connect to the sewer. This is a bone of contention with many developers. The amendment would provide that payment of a specified charge would include the right to be connected. It is a technical and, in a sense, a minor issue to raise at this stage, but I should be grateful if the Minister would respond to my brief remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I well understand the hon. Gentleman's intention in moving the amendment, but I should explain that the aim of the clause as drafted is to protect residents of static caravan parks, for example, from excessive charges for water and sewerage services. The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley no doubt has a good many such sites in his constituency. Site-owners generally act in a reasonable and responsible way. With the help of the clause we will be able to tackle any excessive charging, should problems arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment suggests that those who have paid specified charges, for which the clause provides, should be entitled to connection to the public sewer. The amendment is flawed because it deals with the very circumstances in which connection is not the practical option. It diverts attention away from new powers to set a maximum charge where users receive their water and sewerage services from the authority via a third party. That is a useful consumer protection measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is extremely perceptive; there are many static caravan sites in my constituency, in Dalrymple, in Kincaidston, in Maidens and elsewhere. Secondly, I take it that when the Minister says that the users should be connected to the water supply he means that their premises should be connected, rather than themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall resist the temptation to go through a list of the static caravan sites in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1760</span>
I have been having difficulty in understanding what clause 72 was intended to deal with, but I see from the notes on clauses that it is a precautionary measure to enable the Secretary of State to prevent companies or individuals from making excessive profit from services that they have received from the authority and passed on to third parties. The Minister has confirmed that the clause deals with static caravan sites. I suggest that it would be more satisfactory to cut out the middleman. People pay the Council tax directly in respect of their occupation or ownership of static caravans. It would be just as straightforward for them to pay directly for their water and sewerage services, rather than through the agency of the site operator. There should not be such discrimination between people who live in static caravans and people who live in other kinds of dwellings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another category of people exists to whom services may be sold on an agency basis. We shall return to the subject of the Scottish Landowners Federation if we are not careful. There must be many cases of farmers paying for metered supplies of water and selling it on to people who live in properties on their land. Equally, there may be cases in which landowners benefit from the regular clearance of septic tanks by the water authority, but may charge the occupiers or tenants of property on their land for the service. That is an abuse and the middle man should be cut out of the arrangement. People who occupy such properties, whether dwelling houses or holiday houses, should pay directly for those services, just as they pay their council tax and other charges relating to the property. There should be no scope for profiteering from such services and there should be no need for the clause. I urge the Government to consider that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that there should be no scope for profiteering. That is the reason for the clause. It will ensure that profiteering does not happen. It is a safeguard and deals specifically with the point raised by the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
