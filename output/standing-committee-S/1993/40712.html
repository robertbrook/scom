<br><br><!-- lb --> Agriculture and Fisheries, Scotland</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind hon. Members that the debate is about agriculture and fishing. The supply estimates under discussion cover both.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Sir Hector Monro)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered Class XIV, votes 1 and 2.</p></blockquote>
As Mr. Maxton just said, these estimates cover agriculture and fishing. I shall start with agriculture. I am sure that all Scottish farmers wish that they were having some of this warm weather up north, where it has been raining and has been miserable for the past week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The framework of the common agriculture policy and now of the general agreement on tariffs and trade is crucial. The Government have consistently argued for sensible reform of CAP in the interests of consumers, taxpayers, and farmers. We supported the substantial package of CAP reforms agreed by the European Community in May 1992. Those reforms shifted agricultural support away from wasteful market intervention measures towards direct payments to producers on-farm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government successfully fought against the original MacSharry proposals that would have discriminated against large farms, which are much more prevalent in Scotland. The Government secured a good deal for Scottish farmers. Scottish farmers have benefited substantially from the revised and new schemes introduced since 1992, for example, arable area and headage and extensification payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was particular concern among farmers over the introduction of the new integrated administration and control system—an important measure being implemented across the European Community to help combat fraud. I am pleased to say that the IACS exercise turned out to be a great success by any standards. Over 99 per cent. of ICAS forms were received by the deadline last year, including detailed information and maps for individual holdings in many areas. That was a tremendous achievement, and I commend the staff of the Scottish Office Agriculture and Fisheries Department for the immense amount of additional work that they did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
GATT provides a stable base within which British farmers can plan with more certainty. It provides a more rational framework for the future development of a more market-orientated CAP. The agreement does not take effect until the middle of 1995. It applies to the EC as a whole and as yet is specified in fairly general terms.
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
I agree with the Commission's analysis that the new GATT obligations are broadly consistent with the measures already agreed under CAP reform, notably through the agreed cuts in cereal prices. GATT reinforces the move towards a greater market orientation of agriculture. It should be seen as an opportunity of which United Kingdom and Scottish farmers are in a good position to take advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I took part in a useful and constructive meeting with United Kingdom farming unions to discuss GATT on 18 April. I welcome the measured support of the farming unions for our efforts which have been considerably more positive than in some other Community countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish agriculture, together with food and drink products dependent on farming, has some significant potential advantages in the more competitive environment that lies ahead. At the heart of that is our reputation for quality, based on an unspoilt natural environment and good farming practices. The Government are determined to build on those advantages by encouraging the improved marketing of Scottish food and drink products, at home and abroad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall paraphrase some recent developments. The marketing development scheme, which will be of tremendous help to producers and processors, earmarks £1.5 million for Scotland. There is an EC scheme of grants for processing and marketing agricultural and fisheries products. Over the next six years, more than £30 million is expected to be available in Scotland towards capital grants for buildings, plants and equipment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As many hon. Members know, I have emphasised the importance of quality in farming wherever I have been during the past two years and that supports the line taken by the National Farmers Union for Scotland over the Scottish quality farm assurance scheme. I have also pressed hard for a Scottish quality mark. Mr. James Millar has been chairing a committee which has now given its recommendations. I have commissioned the preparation of a business plan so that that can be further developed this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On top of that, we have a new Scottish food quality certification body which is separate from producers and will certify the quality that is required for Scottish products and will determine which products can have the mark on their packaging.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tarn Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was at the funeral yesterday of the distinguished chief farmer of Glende-von), Brian Cadzow. Several of his colleagues asked about the certification scheme, implying that it would involve them in yet more paperwork. I do not know the rights and wrongs of the matter, but is the Minister reasonably satisfied that an undue amount of paperwork from EC schemes is not being imposed on farmers who have a lot to do anyway?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to accept what the hon. Gentleman said—there is far too much paperwork in life generally and farming certainly has its share of it at
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0142">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
present. However, the certification scheme will have no practical effect on individual farmers. The processors and manufacturers will be required to have products certified so that they can use the Scottish quality mark. I well appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point and have been saying to the Department ever since I joined it—as one who has to fill in the forms himself—that we must try to simplify those forms and prevent some of the errors that have crept in recently. It can be extremely costly if the forms are incorrect. We are unable to have a licence to change forms because of the very strict EC regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I am on marketing, I want to deal with milk because it is important. I am pleased that we were able last week to announce the approval of reorganisation schemes submitted by the three milk marketing boards in Scotland. That brings to an end a period of considerable uncertainty for the milk producers and I am glad that the way forward is now clear. The reorganisation will take place on the vesting day of 1 November 1994, the same day as in England and Wales. On that day the statutory milk marketing boards will be replaced by voluntary co-operatives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is astonishing that the Minister discusses this period of considerable uncertainty as if it were caused by someone else. It was caused by the Government of which he is a member. Is he aware that there is strong opposition throughout the milk producing industry in Scotland as well as from potato farmers about getting rid of the milk marketing boards and the Potato Marketing Board, which provided regulated markets that were good for consumers and producers? Were the Minister to return to the Back Benches, would he, in all sincerity, return to his previous scepticism, if not outright opposition, to the abolition of those boards? My recollection is that he was not all that keen on getting rid of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In common with many Conservatives I am not a great enthusiast of major change so naturally, before the case is presented, one is concerned. But the hon. Gentleman must remember that the pressure for change came from Europe, not from this country. We had to argue through all of this in great depth during discussion of the Agricultural Bill in 1992 and the proposals are the result of those deliberations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend point out to those Euro-enthusiasts on the Opposition Benches that we are in this club so we have to negotiate within the club rules? I commend my hon. Friend for the way in which he does that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his support. I do not want to speak for too long as I know that other hon. Members have a lot to say and we have to cover fishing as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish milk marketing board will be succeeded by the Scottish milk co-operative, the Aberdeen and district milk marketing board by the Aberdeen milk company co-operative and the north of Scotland milk marketing board by the north of Scotland milk co-operative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Milk producers now have the choice of whether they join those co-operatives and sell their milk through them or sell their milk direct to the dairies and other processors of milk. In turn, the dairies and milk processors will have the opportunity, for the first time, to source their milk direct from dairy farmers rather than through the milk marketing boards. That all follows extensive consultation, and we have tried to meet as many points from the Dairy Trade Federation as we have from the National Farmers Union and the Scottish milk marketing boards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Salmond 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Banff and Buchan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may have noticed the press reports about a herd in the north east of Scotland that was suspected to have been infected with BIV or bovine Aids.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is infected by the SNP too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a serious issue. There seems to be a discrepancy between the treatment of that condition in areas covered by the milk board in the north east of Scotland and those covered by milk boards in England. In England, the milk involved was prevented from going into the food chain, while, in the north east of Scotland, it was allowed into it. Is the Minister considering making BIV a notifiable disease, with compensation being allowed for the relevant farmers? Is he at all concerned about the integrity of the food chain, which this example concerns?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Munro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right to say that it is an important matter, and it is one on which he needs to be given a detailed answer. I shall try to provide one when I wind up. However, we do not intend to make it a notifiable disease. He said rightly that the matter concerned only one farm in Scotland. We must watch developments carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was talking about the responsibility of the milk marketing boards. That will sweep away the highly regulated statutory structure, under which all milk is sold through the milk marketing boards or under licence from them, and prices are determined jointly between the milk boards and representatives of the dairy trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In its place will be an open market, in which proper competition can flourish. That will bring benefits of increased competition and increased efficiency in the dairy sector as a whole as a result of market forces being allowed to operate for the first time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now that the reorganisation schemes have been approved, those milk producers who may have already signed up contracts with one or other of the successor co-operatives have a two-week period in which to reflect on whether they wish to remain with the cooperatives or to sell their milk elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is only fair that producers should have that choice, given that many of them will have signed those contracts last autumn in the expectation fo the reorganisation taking place on 1 April this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The livestock sector of Scottish agriculture is in very good heart. The 1992 reforms to the common agricul-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0143">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
tural policy led to substantial increases in the livestock headage subsidy rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, the developments in the market for beef and sheepmeat, in particular in the last few years, have led to buoyant market prices for cattle and sheep farmers in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Total expenditure on the livestock subsidy schemes—the sheep annual premium scheme, the suckler cow premium scheme, the beef special premium scheme and the hill livestock compensatory allowances—has increased from £182 million for the 1992 scheme year to an estimated £218 million under the 1994 scheme year. There has been a dramatic increase in subsidies. If we consider suckler cows in particular, the subsidy—including the extensification addition—is now £93.90, which is a tremendous help to hill farmers, particularly in the less-favoured areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result, the net farm income of cattle and sheep farmers has increased significantly in the past two years. Overall, those farming primarily sheep have seen their net farm income increase by 39 per cent., those farming mainly cattle by 100 per cent. That is all extremely good news for Scottish agriculture.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Maclennan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caithness and Sutherland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister leaves the subject of livestock—although he might have more to say about it—will he comment on the continuing difficulties and uncertainties that arise from the sheep quota allocations? A substantial number of my constituents and, I believe, others in other parts of the highlands face ruin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the great difficulty of the quota system. The Department has been trying to be as helpful as possible in resolving quota problems. As the hon. Gentleman knows, there is an amount of national quota in reserve which we have been allocating in recent months. We have completed categories one and two and now on to group three, which covers the majority of those who wanted additional quota. If all goes well, I hope that we shall be able to notify those farmers next month; I would like to think that if they have additional quotas, they will be in a position to purchase stock at the autumn sales. I understand the difficulties, but we are working through the complicated scheme that we inherited. The hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland and his colleagues in the north of Scotland have presented me with many problems but we shall try to resolve them speedily.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Calum Macdonald 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Western Isles)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the overall amount of subsidy for sheep protection has increased but he ignores the fact that the differential between the subsidies that are given to disadvantaged hill farmers and to other sheep farmers, has been reduced dramatically over the past couple of years. The Minister must know that those fanners face the worst conditions and ought, therefore, to get more support. Will that differential be restored?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman is right. The allowance for less favoured areas and the highlands and islands has maintained the value of
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
the sheep annual premium in most of the areas that the hon. Gentleman represents. As I said, while the high level of sheep premium has held its own in the past two years, the increase in the suckler cow premium has been substantial. That must help many farmers. I shall come to the subject of crofting later on, but we have tried to help crofters as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arable sector has also benefited substantially from the CAP reform. The Department made payments totalling around £97 million, including set-aside payments, to the Scottish arable farmers in 1993. My officials have been analysing claims that were made this year by Scottish farmers under the arable area payments scheme. A detailed announcement will be made as soon as that analysis is complete.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But it is already clear from our analysis of 1994 claims that there has been no overshoot in the LFA this year, and that there has been another overshoot in the non-LFA. While I must stress that some claims, including cross-border claims, have yet to be fully analysed, it is already clear that the overshoot is in the region of 3.8 per cent. That is considerably less than last year's overshoot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is too soon to tell exactly why that further overshoot has occurred. The early indications are that there has been an excess of claimed cropped areas, including set-aside, over the base area. That is particularly true in the case of oilseed rape. It is, of course, important to bear in mind that claimed set-aside counts against the base area. The 0.54 per cent. penalty set-aside from 1993 does not, however, count against the base area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the welcome measures that the Government obtained in Brussels to reduce the impact of the 1993 overshoot, only 20 per cent. of the penalties due in respect of the 1994 harvest in the non-LFA will be applied. That reduction of penalties gives farmers breathing space to get their claims back within the base area when they are preparing their cropping plans for next year. The fact that there is a 20 per cent. penalty on the 3.8 per cent. overshoot will mean that there will be only some 0.7 per cent. penalty in the non-LFA this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My Department will be making the first tranche of oilseed payments to some 2,000 Scottish farmers by the end of August. The remaining 400 or so payments will be made by the end of September.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister say in pounds and pence what effect the overshoot will have on the industry? Does he still stand by the base figures for last year, which were highly controversial, to say the least?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They were not highly controversial, except in the minds of the hon. Gentleman and some academics and consultants. The figures were absolutely clear and were gone through with a fine toothcomb. There was no doubt about the base figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation has improved substantially since last year. The overshoot is likely to be 3.8 per cent., so a 20
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0144">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
per cent. penalty is 0.7 per cent., which is a small figure. If farmers are careful about their cropping plans for next year there should be no overshoot at all. We should work collectively towards that objective. We are not far away from where we want to be: only a small amount is involved, but it makes a difference to the overall payments to farmers in the non-LFA areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to highlight the emphasis that we put on the environment. The environmentally sensitive areas schemes have been a great success in Scotland. There are 10 designated areas and about 800 farmers have agreements. I expect that number to increase, especially if we are able to widen the scope of the grants in the environmental schemes. We are considering introducing support for informal recreation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Worthington 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clydebank and Milngavie)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will mention farm woodland schemes. There is nothing more important for the environment in Scotland in the area over which he has control than forestry. Opposition Members are sceptical about the timing of the Secretary of State's announcement about the future of forestry. We suspect that it will be next week when there is no chance to debate the issue. What is the Minister ashamed of?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely nothing. I assure the hon. Gentleman that there will be a detailed statement from the Secretary of State next week. It would be wrong to go into details of our plans for the commission before that announcement has been made. It is right to say that the farm woodland scheme has been very successful. Indeed, we had to top up the fund because there were so many applications and we did not want anyone to miss out on planting grants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Maxton. The Minister said that the Secretary of State for Scotland will make a statement on forestry next week. The hon. Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor) has today tabled a planted question to the Secretary of State for the Environment about how he proposes to implement the national forest strategy and asks him to make a statement. That has serious implications, because it would appear that the Secretary of State for the Environment has taken over responsibility from the Secretary of State for Scotland and is proposing to make a statement this afternoon. It would be helpful if the Minister told us why that is so and how that relates to the remarks that he has just made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not a matter for the Chair; it is a matter for the Speaker. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to raise it in the House this afternoon, that is a matter for him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is off beam: that is a different matter altogether dealing with the issues raised subsequent to the meeting at Rio, not with the forestry commission in the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will get the full, unexpurgated version in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So that there can be no doubt, will the Minister make it absolutely clear that the Secretary of State will make a statement on forestry to the House next week? Is that right?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As far as I understand it, that is right, yes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was giving information about the organic aid scheme, which we also announced this week. Other important schemes, such as the heather moorland scheme, the habitats scheme and others, show the emphasis that we are putting on supporting the environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Time is catching up on us, but I want to deal with crofting. We must put substantial sums of money into crofting and support important schemes, such as the crofting building grants and loans scheme, which has transformed housing conditions in the crofting areas over many years under all Governments. The crofting counties agricultural grants scheme and the livestock improvement schemes will continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacDonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that a review of the crofter housing scheme is under way in the Department. In anticipation of the outcome of that review, is the Minister saying that the Government believe that the crofter housing scheme is valuable, that it should continue and that the amount that it gives for each house should be increased?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Munro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a good scheme and we want to make it better, as we have the livestock improvement scheme through the changes that we have made this year. The Government believe strongly in supporting the croftering areas as broadly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members may wish to raise other issues in connection with objective 1 and objective 5b, which are so important in the highlands and islands and, in the case of objective 5b, throughout Scotland. However, I wish to turn to fishing, which is as important as agriculture in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fishing industry is especially important in Scotland, as a major part of the United Kingdom fishing fleet is based there. A large majority of the fish landings made into the United Kingdom come into Scottish ports, and the salmon farming industry is almost entirely concentrated in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Especially in areas such as the north-east and in the highlands and islands, the industry is vital for the future of many of our coastal communities, especially in the remote areas and in the islands. The Government have never lost sight of that. We know just how important it is to sustain a viable economy in those areas, and we understand the part that a profitable fishing and fish farming industry can play.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that that requires us to have in place an effective policy on fish conservation—to protect the resources that will sustain the jobs in the long term. We recognise that some hard decisions are necessary in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0145">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
short term if we are to ensure the industry's future in years to come.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Norman A. Godman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Port Glasgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I right in thinking that the European Commission publishes a report on 1 July each year on the implementation of multi-annual guidance programmes throughout the Community? Will the Minister be kind enough to place a copy of that report in the Library, if he has not done so already? Is he willing to acknowledge that the United Kingdom is making much less progress that other maritime states with regard to multi-annual guidance programmes for the 1993–96 period? Are the Minister's decommissioning proposals likely to enable the United Kingdom to catch up with the other states, or will we continue to lag behind?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We will certainly place the report in the Library. I am about to come to the question of decommissioning, which is crucial. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that we are a long way behind our MAGP target, but decommissioning is a considerable step in the right direction. We have a long way to catch up by 1996 if we are to fulfil our duties to the Commission in terms of the MAGP, largely because the day-at-sea issue is before the European Court and cannot be implemented at the present time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the main requirements is to ensure that the size of the fleet is kept in balance with fish stocks. That is an issue throughout Europe, indeed throughout the developed world. Everywhere increasing efficiency in fish catching technology has meant that there are too many boats chasing too few fish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a number of ways of addressing the problem. The starting point must be to prevent uncontrolled increases in fishing capacity. For some years, we have had a restrictive licensing policy. All fishing vessels, regardless of size, now have to hold licences. New entrants to the fleet must acquire a licence from an existing licence holder, but that does nothing to address imbalances that have already built up. Nor does it tackle the problem of constantly improving efficiencies. These problems must be tackled more directly. That is why we believe that there is a role for a decommissioning scheme; we confirmed recently that that scheme is to continue this year and in 1995, at a cost to the taxpayer of £25 million over the three years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Wallace 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Orkney and Shetland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must clarify what will be the actual cost to the British taxpayer over the three years—how much of that £25 million will be returned to the British Government from Brussels and how much has already been taken back by the Treasury in taxation, given that my amendments to the Finance Bill last year, which would have exempted any decommissioning payments from tax, were defeated by the Government? What is the accurate figure of the cost to the taxpayer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman forgets that the British taxpayer pays a large overall sum to the European Community, from where any repayment would come. After the hon. Gentleman's performance in the House last night, when he proposed to reduce
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
taxation, I wonder how he would step up a decommissioning scheme such as the one that we are discussing. The hon. Gentleman is always saying that that would be the policy of his party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To follow the point made by the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace), the Minister says that £25 million has been spent, but have not the Government received £17.5 million from Brussels, thereby leaving a net bill for the Exchequer of £7.5 million, which will be further reduced by tax paid by fishermen in receipt of the decommissioning grants? That makes a sum far short of £25 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot accept that. As I said earlier, we must remember that we pay a huge sum into the Community before we start taking any grants back from it. The point is that we have this very important scheme, which will continue this year and next. That is very important for the Scottish fishing fleet. We had over 40 boats involved in the scheme last year, which was very beneficial to their owners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the question of funding, could my hon. Friend clarify whether, if the Government increased the £25 million to, say, £30 million, that would attract further contributions from the Community?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot be explicit on that. However, we must be clear that the money has been wrung from the Treasury after a great deal of pressure and I have been blunt with the fishing industry that there will be no likelihood of an extension of that £25 million in the current three-year period. I think that the fishing industry now accepts that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I promise that this will be my last intervention. The Minister is ducking the question of the MAGP when he talks about decommissioning. Is not it clearly the case that the criteria for the MAGP are the reduction in fleet tonnage and the reduction in engine power, but does not that necessarily lead to a reduction in fishing activity? Should not we be aiming for some sort of assessment of fishing activity, rather than a crude reduction in the fleet tonnage and engine capacity?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has asked about the MAGP; we reckon that the decommissioning scheme will take out 2.2 per cent. to 2.5 per cent. over the three years, so it is not a very significant amount. If things go well, and depending on how the scheme works out in detail, it may be 8 per cent. or 9 per cent. That is of course a long way from our 19 per cent. target. We will still have 10 per cent. to make up, some of which we must adjust to the registration and licensing scheme. Had we now been in the second year of the days at sea restrictions, we would have been able to have effected much of that target but, as the hon. Gentleman knows, we were taken to the European Court of Justice on that issue and it may be some time before it reports. The case was not taken there by the Scottish Fisherman's Federation, with which we have an excellent relationship. If we had gone ahead with the scheme—the final Government conclusions on the scheme were not published
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0146">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
because we were taken to court before we had the opportunity to publish them—it would have been acceptable to the majority of fishermen in the United Kingdom and would have made substantial strides forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacDonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given that the days-at-sea restriction has been withdrawn, for the reasons that the Minister gave, will he consider again the issue of a weekend ban on prawn fishing on the west coast? That would be easy to work out and to police and would be supported by local fishermen. This is the time to think again about a weekend ban.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always prepared to consider constructive suggestions. The hon. Gentleman will remember a forum of the Sea Fish Industry Authority, held in the Western Isles, to discuss that matter. The general view was that there should be no change. We must consider the entire Scottish fleet, although fishermen on the Clyde have their own arrangements and do not fish on Sundays or at weekends. I am prepared to ask the SFIA to reconsider the matter because, in the interests of the industry's long-term future, it is important to find ways of limiting effort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everyone says that conservation is crucial and that we must do all that we can to conserve precious and, in many instances, fragile fish stocks, yet there is much criticism when we introduce measures to try to reduce pressures on stocks and look to the long-term future of the fishing industry. We must find a way forward. With colleagues in the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and those in the industry, we are discussing technical measures and other ways of reducing current pressure on fish stocks. We have gone to immense trouble to get extra scientific advice which tells us that some stocks are in danger. Therefore, we cannot continue increasing the quota as we did with many stocks this year, although not in the Western Isles where stocks are even more fragile. When we discuss quotas and tax in December, we do not want to have to reduce them again, but, depending on how the fishing season goes this year, that is a possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government give much support to fishing over and above the £25 million decommissioning scheme. They give a total of about £50 million a year to protect the long-term future of the fishing industry, through fishery protection, scientific advice and other important support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking ahead, two issues above all others are most important: the quotas that fishermen are allowed to catch and the prices that they get for those catches. I have already spoken of my concern about quotas. There was an exceptional increase in the haddock quota this year. The rest are under pressure and we must be very careful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that prices have generally stabilised, after a substantial fall in the spring. In some cases, they have improved since last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
I shall finish now because I want to hear what other hon. Members have to say. Before I do, let me speak a little about salmon farming.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed that the Minister has said nothing about the safety of fishing boats. There have been many problems recently, particularly with the Ocean Gem, which was nearly pulled under by the USS Nitro. The captain of the American ship was given only a reprimand for that. There is continuing worry about naval vessels, particularly American vessels, in the Clyde. Will the Minister pursue that issue, through the Ministry of Defence, with the American navy? Like me, my hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman) is an honorary president of the Clyde Fishermen's Association. He will confirm that there is deep anxiety among Clyde fishermen about the continued threat to fishing boats from American naval vessels.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course we share the hon. Gentleman's anxiety about any fishing vessel being in danger at any time from Ministry of Defence operations. All seamen accept the dangers of the maritime environment, but they should not be affected by defence operations. But that matter is for the Ministries of Defence and of Transport, the latter of which has responsibility for the coastguards. The matter has been brought to the attention of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, but I shall make certain that a letter is sent to the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley about that particular incident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite a poor harvest, Scottish farming income in 1993 rose by 24 per cent. from 1992. It has been a good year. Interest rates and inflation are down, and farming is going extremely well at present. In the same way, we can resolve the issues of effort relative to fishing. We are working hard at that, and the future for that industry will be good, too. However, we must remember that conservation must always come first. We have seen what disasters can occur—the seas around Canada, for instance, were virtually fished out. We must be careful about the European common fisheries policy, especially given the accession of Spain and Portugal, and possibly that of the Scandinavian countries as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those matters are high on the Government's list of priorities. We intend to resolve them in the best interests of our fishermen.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for the way in which he opened the debate. However, I fear that the usual channels may have become blocked at some point: I understood that the votes to be tabled covered, agriculture and fisheries, but our Whips' Office made it clear that we wanted a debate on fisheries. That is not to diminish the importance of agriculture—just the opposite—but the Minister spoke for some 41 minutes. He gave us a Cook's tour of the various agricultural
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0147">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
issues, and touched only briefly on fishing matters. He started to tackle the question of salmon farming but got no further. We cannot do justice to Scotland's farming and fishing industries in a debate of two and a half hours. If I took as long in replying, and allowing for a wind-up of 20 minutes, there would be less than three quarters of an hour for other hon. Members to have their say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I shall confine myself to fisheries matters, about which we wrote to the Secretary of State earlier in the year asking for a debate. If we defeated the motion, we would have another day—another two and half hours of discussion, which we could devote to the important matters connected with agriculture. The Minister made it clear that there are many important matters for discussion, and we should give them no more than superficial coverage if we tried to deal with the whole remit of agriculture and fisheries in such a short time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirk-wood) can articulate the reasons better that I, but the perception was that a tax concession was being given to Englishmen that was not being given to Scotsmen. In the past, I have raised merry hell at such tax imbalances. Under the treaty of Union, there has to be equality on matters of personal taxation on both sides of the border.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is not a matter for either of the votes that we are currently considering. Therefore, I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman could stick to the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to continue. No doubt the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) will get his chance to try to keep the debate within order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only opportunities that we have to debate the important issue of fisheries are during the annual debate before the December council meeting on specific orders, or when the Liberal Democrats use their days to debate fisheries on the Floor of the House and in the Scottish Grand Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And, to be fair, the Scottish National party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The industry has been having a vigorous debate ignited by the Save Britain's Fish Campaign. Although I respect the conviction with which the leaders of that campaign have pursued their case—we all subscribe to the view that Britain must secure a successful future for its fishing industry—it is a misguided campaign. As the
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) is not a member of the Scottish Grand Committee, I suspect that the Save Britain's Fish Campaign does not have too many adherents in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The common fisheries policy undoubtedly has its faults but if there are international waters, some type of international management and agreement is necessary. Otherwise, the unilateral policy of one country can be undone by the unilateral policy of another. On a previous occasion we agreed that fish swimming in the North sea did not recognise dates on the calendar; neither do they recognise international boundaries and median lines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other substantial flaw in the Save Britain's Fish Campaign is that if we were totally to repatriate the fisheries policy, we would put it entirely in the hands of the British Government. Heaven help the fishing industry if it were entirely in the hands of the Government, given how they have mismanaged it recently. That could, indeed, be the reason why the Minister was not too keen to focus the debate entirely on fisheries. There is not much confidence among Opposition Members nor, I suspect, in the industry itself in there being competent management if the industry were left entirely in the Government's hands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. Gentleman list two or three examples of how the Government are seen to have mismanaged the fishing interest?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sometimes hon. Members respond by saying, "I was just coming to that" and indeed, the rest of my speech is about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, there is a policy vacuum. As the Minister suggested during his brief remarks on fisheries, the Government's policy was anchored in their commitment to days-at-sea restrictions. Despite repeated warnings from many Opposition Members and from the industry—and one or two Conservative Members who barely managed to find the courage to put their heads above the parapet—that the policy was unfair, unworkable and unacceptable, the Government pressed on. They spent considerable amounts of money trying to put the various bits and pieces into place and then, when the policy was challenged in the High Court by the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, it foundered. The policy has been suspended, pending a determination by the European Court, which is not likely to happen until the latter part of next year at the earliest, at a time when we shall be drawing close to the critical date for meeting our multi-annual guidance programme targets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first tranche of decommissioning occurred last year and it is estimated that about 2.2 per cent. of the 19 per cent. reduction in MAGP targets has been reached. A report by the European Commission on the progress of the MAGP states that the set of figures most favourable to British interests show the United Kingdom to be significantly outside the intermediate objectives for 1993.I think that the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow referred to that report earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The critical question is how in the world we will reach those targets. The Minister said that we must do some-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0148">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
thing towards reducing the pressure on fishing stocks but, just as the Prince of Wales walking through the Welsh mining towns in the 1920s said, "Something must be done", he was remarkably unspecific about what.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a written answer to me on 7 July, the Minister of State at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Currently we are moving towards our targets via decommissioning and licence penalties. We are also having discussions with the Commission on the possible contribution to effort reduction from technical conservation measures."—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 7 July 1994; Vol. 246, 	<i>C280–1.)</i></p></blockquote>
I want to examine the elements which seem to be the sum and substance of the Government's plan to try to reach the MAPG targets. Licence aggregation is a positive step that we especially welcome, because it allows for an element of new build. It is important that we try to ensure that the age profile of our fleet is as young as possible. Indeed, it has had some form of industry-financing decommissioning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we should really like to know is what contribution towards meeting the 19 per cent. reduction by 1996 do the Government think will come from licence aggregation? Do they have any proposals to alter the aggregation terms to make that aspect more effective?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been told that there will possibly be a contribution to effort reduction from technical conservation measures. Can the Minister tell us how negotiations are proceeding on that? It was my understanding that, in the review of the MAGP that has been referred to, the United Kingdom alone has put forward proposals for including reference to technical conservation measures being converted in some way into a reduction. I do not quibble with the fact that that should be included to some extent. However, the indications are that it will provide some help at the margins, but will not make a major contribution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: does the hon. Gentleman agree that it would be advisable for the Government to speak with to the industry about those technical issues? That approach has been neglected to date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course it is important to speak to the industry. Indeed, it put forward proposals as long ago as September. There was a long period in which there was not as much contact as there should have been but, to be fair, the level of contact has picked up recently. However, a degree of urgency is still missing, considering that the industry has done its part by making proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to decommissing, the Minister conceded that the proposals will not achieve a significant amount. If one assumes that the 2.2 per cent. reduction made-last year is repeated in the next two years, decommissioning will, at best, contribute 6 per cent. or 7 per cent. towards reducing our fleet capacity. That leaves a significant shortfall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not answer the question about the costs to the British taxpayer. He said that Britain makes its contributions to the Community. What he is saying,
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
basically, is that British taxpayers have been funding the decommissioning of other countries' fishing fleets, but have contributed little to funding the decommissioning of our own fishing vessels.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that that the bogus nature of the Minister's point was revealed by the fact that that argument can be applied to any European Union spending across a range of issues? Why on earth should the Minister pick out fishing and say that expenditure on it comes specifically from decommissioning, when there is no hypothecation of EC spending under the Fontainbleau agreement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason is the weakness of the Government's argument. They know that Britain missed out on decommissioning funds before 1992, which is why our fishing fleet has a higher capacity reduction target to meet. Since 1992, the failure to vote any real funds for decommissioning has meant that we are falling further behind and not making the expected contribution from decommissioning towards reaching the MAGP target.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was my party that proposed the tax reduction for fisherman in the Finance Bill 1993 to ensure that the money that they got from decommissioning was not subject to taxation. It was the Government who imposed the tax on the fisherman. That makes for an interesting contrast between the taxation party in Government and the reduced taxation party, which we represent in this case. The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson) laughs but, a fisherman in his constituency, if he has received decommissioning funds, will find that, after he has taken off the money for scrapping—which the fishermen themselves are responsible for—and has paid tax very little of the decommissioning funds is left.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we have is a hole in the Government's fisheries policy. The figures do not add up. We do not know how we shall reach the MAGP targets by 1996, and nothing that has been said today gives any indication of how we shall do that. We have certainly long advocated a much greater emphasis on decommissioning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not just a technical, academic point if we do not reach them. There are important implications for the fleet. As long as we remain so far behind, the fleet is being denied the funding that is essential for it to be restructured. The age profile of the fleet grows accordingly, and that has a damaging effect on efficiency and on safety, an issue that unites the Committee in our concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has also been an effect on boat building. The Sea Fish Industry Authority's review of the UK fish boat building industry, which was published earlier this year, emphasised the concerns that many of us have been expressing, not least my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie) who has an important boat building yard in her constituency. We are losing our capacity because there has not been sufficient investment in boat building. The fact that the Government seem to have little interest in any scrap and build policy under the new EC structures regulations means
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0149">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
that our fleet is going to get progressively older and less competitive than those of other EC nations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The industry fears that the Government are going to find some other way of reaching the MAGP target. Will they try to bring in effort limitation by the back door? Will the Minister say what prospect there is of effort limitation being introduced in area VI as a result of the arrangements that have been made for the completion of the Spanish and Portuguese accession? There was considerable interest and concern about what the impact of that would be on the North sea. I know that there is some dispute as to how effectively the Government have managed to keep Spanish vessels out of the North sea but, because of the focus on that, much less attention has been paid to the effect that effort limitation will have on those who fish in west of Scotland waters as far as the Irish box. Will there be containment of fishing effort there, and what will be its effect? Will some form of days-at-sea restrictions be applied to Scottish vessels that fish in area VI? I understand that some kind of effort limitation is likely. If it is applied, the principle of subsidiarity will then come into play. That raises the question of whether the Spaniards are going to enforce their rules on effort limitation as rigorously as we can well imagine the British Government will enforce the rules that apply to British vessels. We have already seen numerous television documentaries that show how lightly the rules regarding fish landing sizes are taken in Spanish ports; what guarantees will we have that there will be any enforcement of effort limitation in places such as area VI?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to resources that come into the industry, will the Minister say what representations or markers the British Government have already put down in order to receive funds from the PESCA scheme, which has recently been put forward by the European Union? My information is that 250 million ecu have been set aside for that, but bids must be made. The Government again seem reluctant to propose measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While some of the measures might be seen as negative in that they attempt to cope with the rundown of the industry in particular areas, they are important. Decommissioning funds go to the owners of vessels, but many people are employed on fishing vessels who do not receive any money from decommissioning schemes. Other measures to retrain such people and to enable economic activity to diversify in communities that have been hit by the restructuring of a fleet are very important. The Government will betray such communities if they do not seek to access funds that the European Union is making available. There are also positive measures for fishing communities, such as the marketing and promotion of fish products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On bureaucracy, the fishing industry is one of the most heavily regulated industries in our country. One sometimes imagines that a fisherman ought to take a Queen's counsel on board to make sure that he can keep within the law. That brings home just how remote these debates and the regulations that are promulgated from London. Edinburgh and Brussels are from real life. No institution, commission or Government has yet got to grips with problem—which everyone identifies—of catching small fish in nets with meshes that can
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
be made too small or which have attachments that do not allow the fish to escape. Many fishermen have to spend ages trying to find a way around the regulations simply to make a living. The importance of fishing communities does not seem to impinge as much as it should on those who make the decisions. Fishermen should have a greater involvement in the setting of quotas of allowable catches. They, too, have considerable knowledge as well as people in scientific laboratories. They would have a greater interest in maintaining those quotas because they would have had a hand in setting them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister tell us whether there is any truth in the rumour that the Scottish Office marine laboratory at Aberdeen and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food laboratory in Lowestoft are to be merged? Concern about that was expressed several weeks ago. There is general anxiety about the future of Government laboratories. If those two laboratories are to be merged, what will be the consequences for jobs and for control? Will control move to London or will it remain in Edinburgh? I said that fishermen should be more involved. It would be a big mistake if the focus of attention and decision making was taken away from Scotland because that is where the bulk of the fishing fleet is located.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for fish farming, there is now a lull in the storm after the great difficulties that the industry faced just before Christmas and in the early months of this year. Information coming from Norway is that 20 per cent. more feedstuff has been supplied to Norwegian fish farmers than at the equivalent time last year. We all know what the consequences of that were last year: over production and the subsequent dumping of much of that production on the European market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a delay in much of the Norwegian fish coming on to the market because of growth problems during the winter, but in the next month or two we can expect greater volumes of Norwegian salmon on the market. Are the Government ready for that this year and will they take more effective action instead of just showing good intentions? When it came to the bit last year, all that the Secretary of State did was to write to the Commissioner to express his concern and draw attention to the fact that enforcement action was available. Unlike the Irish Government, the British Government did not formally ask the Commission to take enforcement action to secure a minimum import price.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now have a reference price, but that will be effective only if there are other measures to back it up. Under GATT, there can be a countervailing charge only if measures are in place to control domestic production. This is an old issue, but the Minister will not be surprised to hear me mention producer organisations. They have widespread support throughtout the industry. In the medium to long term, we will never fully eliminate the troughs and peaks of the industry's success and difficulties, but we should try to iron them out not just in Scotland but across the European Union. There seems a willingness for Norway to participate.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Bearing in mind your strictures on brevity, Mr. Maxton, like the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland I shall restrict my remarks to fishing and fish processing in particular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said on previous occasions, after Humberside, Aberdeen has the greatest concentration of fish processors in the United Kingdom, most of them in my constituency. In Aberdeen, South there are almost 3,000 jobs directly involved in fish processing and many more in businesses that service fish processing and rely upon it. Aberdeen's relationship with the fishing industry has changed substantially in recent years, in favour of the processing sector, and I know that the Committee will understand if I dwell on that although I am acutely aware that catcher, processor, retailer and consumer are inextricably linked. Their fortunes are dependent on each other. Last year, when a group of catchers processors and salesmen met in Grampian to address the problems of supply and demand, they highlighted graphically the problems of lacking an integrated approach to common problems. It is a lesson which the Scottish fishing industry should take to heart.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But 1994 has not been an easy year for the fish processing sector. Whilst quotas for this year were increased, the expected stocks did not translate into landings and many processors were faced with shortfalls and higher quayside prices. It is testimony to the flexibility of the processors that they have been able to
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
absorb many of those factors in an effort to avoid passing on extra costs to the consumer. Their investment in new machinery and better working practices has resulted in more efficient operations but such cost absorption cannot go on forever, or go on unchecked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee, like the processing sector, recognises that a variety of economic factors have depressed the market—such as increased competition from other foodstuffs, low priced imports from European Union countries and the lingering effects of European recession. However, as the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland said—the structural problems of the catching sector are particularly responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have done much to prevent these problems from worsening and I congratulate the stance taken by my hon. Friend and his colleagues at the April Fisheries Council with regard to fishing in off-sea waters by Spain. Furthermore, I was particularly pleased at the way negotiations turned out for Norway's accession to the European Union. United Kingdom interests have been protected and the calculation of quotas respects the principle of relative stability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the old problem remains: we cannot catch fish which are not there. It is clear that there is still too much catching capacity. The Government's first round of decommissioning, long championed by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, when he was on the Back Benches, has been successful. I accept that it was a limited scheme but any scheme is a start and it has helped. I welcome the announcement that it will continue this year and next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1992, when I first came to the House, I served on the Committee of the Fisheries (Wild Life) Conservation Bill and I supported the days-at-sea legislation. In Committee, I said that it was not enough to cut fishing capacity, but that it was necessary to control the catching capacity of the remaining players. It is unfortunate that the days-at-sea proposals have had to be postponed in the light of the various actions that are taking place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Days-at-sea aside, I believe that more can be done to preserve stocks and safeguard the livelihoods of all those involved in the industry unpalatable though many such measures are to those people. If our conservation measures bear fruit, with an increase in young fish from higher breeding levels, the number of fish below the minimum landing size will increase—more will be discarded and wasted unless we enforce a change in mesh specifications. It is widely known that diamond mesh nets close under pressure and that the cod end becomes impenetrable to undersized fish so that they cannot pass through and die, of use to no-one. I have urged my hon. Friend the Under Secretary before and I do so again to consider making square mesh panels mandatory, as a real step in helping conservation and increasing fish stocks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Returning to shore, I referred earlier to efforts made by the processing sector to avoid passing on costs to the consumer and I would like to elaborate on that. In today's highly competitive food market, there is no such
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0151">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
thing as customer loyalty. Consumers are all too ready to try something new or something cheaper. That is why the Sea Fish Industry Authority initiative to start a major, £1 million, advertising campaign, including television, later this year is timely and vital. I hope that that development will result in year-round promotion of our quality fish products. One only needs to switch on the television to see the efforts made by other food produce sectors to appreciate that we must do much more to promote fish. If Scottish beef, Scottish pork and Scottish lamb can be marketed in such a way, with great success, then so too can Scottish fish. I know that the Sea Fish Industry Authority has applied for European Union funding for a follow-up advertising campaign early next year and I hope that my hon. Friend will give that initiative every support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier this year, I spoke at a New Zealand trade mission which was visiting Aberdeen with the aim of gaining new markets for fish from the seas of the southern hemisphere—it wanted to supply its product to British fish processors. That experience brought home two important messages to me: first, the ever-increasing international nature of the processing industry and, secondly, the promotional strengths of the mission—a matter which I wish to press on my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The quality of literature and the general sales pitch of the New Zealand industry is something that we must emulate. Scotland's agricultural produce has become the byword for quality throughout the world, and we must ensure that our fish products receive the same recognition. I welcome the efforts of Scottish Seafood Promotions, and I am heartened that industry representatives have joined Scottish Enterprise and Grampian Seaford to seek new ways in which to promote Scottish fish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned the processing sector's capacity to absorb price fluctuations to protect the consumer, but that cannot continue. In Grampian, more than £30 million of public and private money has been invested in refurbishing and renewing processing premises to satisfy existing and potential hygiene regulations. It is important that the regulations are applied uniformly throughout the European Union. We are all aware that, in other European countries, the same hygiene conditions are signed up to, but they are not enforced, and the resulting price advantage gives them an easy entry into our markets. It is time that we were tough with those in Europe who ignore European laws and rulings when it suits them. Fish processing is a prime example of where to start taking such action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to the Minister, my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro), who does a magnificent job of defending Scottish fishing interests. His job is not made easier by Opposition Members who whip up trouble for the sheer hell of it. They promise all things to catchers and processors alike, in the knowledge that they will never have to deliver.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fishing industry, however, is not so easily conned. It knows that, at every turn, the Government are fighting at home and abroad in the industry's interests. From the relatively small items, such as blocking new food
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
colour regulations that would affect our processors, to the even higher stakes of negotiating the accession of a new European Union member with a substantial fishing industry of its own, the Government can be relied on to fight for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fight will be made easier for us as we enter negotiations with all the clout that our United Kingdom membership brings. That fact is not lost on the leaders of the Scottish fishing industry. They recognise—even if Opposition Members do not—that Scottish Parliaments or Scottish Assemblies will not produce extra fish, but Will result in diminished influence in Europe. The fishing industry is vital for Scotland in general and for Aberdeen in particular, and I know that my hon. Friend the Minister will do all that he can to ensure that it continues to be so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.42 am</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The kindest interpretation of the fisheries industry is that the EC common fisheries policy remains uncertain and that the Government's position is even more uncertain. The fishing vessels decommissioning scheme will be debated in the House on Thursday. We welcome the fact that the uncertainty about the Government's commitment to decommissioning has ended by the laying of the current scheme. The undertaking that the third tranche of the overall budget of £25 million, which was announced in 1992, will now be forthcoming in 1995 represents the reality that decommissioning is the only means by which the United Kingdom can make an impact on its multi-annual guidance programme targets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A more substantial sum than £25 million is required. It is, at the least, half-hearted. That was also the finding of the Select Committee on Agriculture. Even Richard Carden of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, who appeared before the Committee, conceded that £25 million was nowhere near enough money to take out a sufficient proportion of the United Kingdom's fishing capacity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's failure to reduce the North sea fishing in line with European targets means that, by 1996, we will be legally obliged to cut our fishing by 19 per cent. The figures, however, in the European Union fishing vessel register reveal that the fleet will not be shrinking to schedule, and that we shall still have a 15 per cent., shortfall to make up. Earlier this year, 	<i>Scotland on Sunday</i> stated that Government sources admitted that the United Kingdom's fishing policy was in a shambles. The European Union register showed that Britain was lagging behind other member states, which are putting funds into decommissioning and into compensation to take boats out of the fleet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be a proper decommissioning scheme, backed with technical conservation measures. The abiding complaint of fishermen is that there is not a level playing field. Fishermen were denied access to Community structure funds for decommissioning purposes from 1986 to 1992. They were then offered only a limited recourse to funds by virtue of the modest £25 million United Kingdom decommissioning budget over three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0152">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
It is important to nail the Government in relation to Government expenditure. Through Community claw-back, the Government have already generated £5 million of the £7.5 million cost of the 1993 scheme. They will recover similar amounts from the global amounts spent under the 1994 and 1995 schemes. The Government commitment adds up to this: by the end of next year, the original outlay of £25 million for that purpose will mean a return of £17.5 million from Brussels, thereby leaving a net bill for the Exchequer of £7.5 million. As the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland pointed out, that will be further reduced by amounts of taxation paid by fishermen who have decommissioning grants. At best, that sum is niggardly. We need a further commitment from the Government, who undoubtedly have seriously mismanaged the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, crews should be adequately compensated through the European Community social fund. EC grants should be used for alternative employment and for retraining in communities where fish-related occupations are extremely important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not say much about salmon farmers. I refer to an article in the 	<i>Financial Tunes</i> last November. It showed that, contrary to the denials of the Norwegian Government, the Norwegian salmon industry receives both direct and hidden subsidies and it receives from the Norwegian Government 20 per cent. subsidies on the cost of production. In Scotland, 6,000 jobs are at stake in the salmon industry. It is worth £180 million per year, and almost half its products are sold in the export markets. The industry is extremely important. The Norwegian Government have been talking to Scottish farmers. However, there is still a long way to go on the issue. Although the Norwegians have stated that they will try to deal with the structural surplus so that free and fair competition can take place in the European Union, that will require the support and commitment of the Government. It appears that such support and commitment from the Government are still slightly lacking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Farmers Union for Scotland has welcomed the changes in the common agricultural policy, but there is still a long way to go on some issues—for example, hill farming. Hill farming is a crucial sector of Scottish agriculture. It occupies approximately 90 per cent. of Scotland's agricultural land and it involves 16,500 fanners and crofters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cuts in the hill livestock compensatory allowance for 1993 and 1994 have damaged producer confidence in the Government's commitment to the scheme and to less-favoured areas. There needs to be a re-establishment of the HLCA payment differentials so that the most disadvantaged areas receive support and compensation, because such farming is done in areas of permanent natural handicap. We do not want a depopulation and dereliction of the countryside. Therefore, it is vital to have a commitment from the Government on the future of the HLCA payments as a key to securing hill farming incomes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may briefly mention the arable area payments scheme. The National Farmers Union for Scot-
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
land wants the Government to find a long-term solution in the European Union. In the context of the scheme, there have been major problems since the introduction of the common agricultural policy reforms. A penalty of 5.4 per cent. was to apply. That would have meant a cash cut to the farmers and extra uncompensated set-aside in the next year. It must be remembered that 20 per cent. of Scotland's cereals land would have been standing idle as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The EU rules are being changed to moderate the impact of the penalty for the first three years. They are welcome, but they do not deal with the cause of the problem. The cause of the problem is that the arable area payment scheme base area figures for Scotland are too small. Unless that fundamental problem is addressed, we can look forward to more penalty problems in Scotland. The danger of massive financial loss—which will have knock-on effects on Scottish agriculture supply and on the food and drinks industry—looms over us. A long-term solution is, therefore, extremely important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned the Milk Marketing Board. I remember sitting in its headquarters in Govan with some of my colleagues more than a year ago. The board was perplexed about what the Government intended to do about the industry. There have been 12 to 15 months of uncertainty and we are now back in our original position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a co-op member, I welcome the Government's commitment to the establishment of co-ops in the milk marketing industry. However, the industry needs stability. We are aware that the European Commission is proposing a 1 per cent. cut in milk quotas. There is no evidence to suggest that cuts in milk support arrangements can be justified. The cuts in quotas mean long-term structural adjustments. Currently, Scotland is short of milk. It is important for the Government to argue their case and fight their corner in Brussels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is suggesting that a statement on the agricultural wages board should be made before the recess. Such a statement is already long overdue. Setting legal minimum terms for the wages and conditions of farm workers is welcomed by the National Farmers Union and by respondents to the consultation document sent out by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is poverty in the agricultural sector; it contains the most highly skilled workers, but their wages are 30 per cent. below the industrial average. Using the average of the Low Pay Unit and the Council of Europe's low pay threshold, 43 per cent. of full-time women agricultural workers have earnings below the low pay threshold. They earn £76 per week less than employees in manufacturing. The minimum rates for full-time pay set by the agricultural wages board in March 1994 ranged from £145 to £195. That is not luxury in anyone's terms. The farmers unions, both Scottish and English, do not want a minority in their midst who are paid starvation wages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fragile rural economies will be further jeopardised by increased hardship among agricultural workers. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0153">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
Government should heed the message from the Scottish NFU. Last year, the hon. Member for Orkey and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) and I were at the annual dinner of the Scottish NFU. The Secretary of State for Scotland told us that he was a fully paid-up member of the union. Indeed, he was so fully paid up that he double-paid the year before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish NFU wants the agricultural wages board to be retained. It also wants minimum wages, other entitlements and conditions of employment to be retained. The Scottish NFU sees sense in the Labour party's proposal for a minimum wage for everyone in the country. If the SNFU wishes that for its members and if the Secretary of State is a member of the union, surely the Government could accept such a sensible point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The farm woodlands scheme impinges on forestry. The Government's proposal for forestry was slipped out last year during the recess. Only because of concerted opposition from the Opposition and from the public did the Government change their view on the issue. I note that, under the farm woodlands scheme, £827 million is to be paid out during the next 10 or 15 years. The future of the forest industry is important to that scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A next steps agency has been suggested, but it is important that the criterion used by the Government is not commercial considerations but multi-purpose forestry. That will impinge on the agricultural sector in Scotland, and it is important that the Government maintain that criterion for multi-purpose forestry. The next steps agency and a desire for commercial freedom would be a betrayal of the Scottish countryside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The common agricultural policy is still a mess. It now costs £30.4 billion. For a typical family in Scotland, that means about £20 a week in higher taxes and food prices. That impinges on their budgets, and it is time that the Government stated their plans and sorted out the CAP.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Kynoch 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intend to be as brief as possible. Although I welcome the percentage increases in farm incomes, which my hon. Friend the Minister mentioned, they occur on an extremely low base, and I hope that incomes for farmers, especially in less-favoured areas, will continue to rise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister referred to integrated administration and control system forms and the prevention of fraud. Farmers in my part of the world welcome the combating of fraud, especially in the markets of our European partners, but they have little time for form filling. When the forms were introduced last year,. there were many problems about the time taken to fill them in. This year, there were problems arising from late sowings, which were caused by last year's late harvest, the late planting of winter crops, and late sowings in the spring. I hope that the farmers took on board the comments made by my hon. Friend the Minister. Just before the deadline, farmers could submit forms with estimated figures that could be adjusted later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
Farmers take instructions literally, and they need much guidance about what they can and cannot do. They are sensitive to the fact that if they do something wrong they could cut themselves off from Scottish Office assistance, so I welcomed my hon. Friend's words at that time. I hope that similar advice will continue to be given so that farmers will know where they stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for cereal overshoot, I was going to say that farmers were concerned about where they stood in relation to planning for next year. I was going to urge my hon. Friend to say what the overshoot, as declared by the integrated administration and control system data, would be. I was pleased that he anticipated what I was going to say, by announcing that the overshoot would be 3.8 per cent. I urge my hon. Friend to broadcast that figure—if it is the final figure—as widely as possible, so that all farmers are aware of it and how it has been arrived at.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister referred to the quality schemes. I was pleased to read the July edition of "Agribusiness", which is produced in my constituency. The editor, Edwin Gillanders, referred in his leader to the launch of a Scottish beef club for the United Kingdom, on the eve of the royal highland show. He urged farmers to participate in farm assurance schemes, so that their product, which is a quality product, was marketed as such in world-markets, so that it could command the premium prices that I believe it should.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned about Germany's attitude to beef imports and its BSE scaremongering. I am even more concerned that the French have followed the Germans in urging the European Union to impose further restrictions on the export of United Kingdom beef. I hope that the recognition that the British Government have given to the importance of the industry—to Scotland, in particular, but also to the rest of the United Kingdom—by their firm rebuttal of the German action will continue, and that, if the Germans go ahead with their ban, we will take Germany to the European Court to ensure that we have a fair and level playing field for our agricultural exporters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year, I accompanied my hon. Friend the Minister to the McIntosh Donald slaughterhouse in my constituency, which is one of the most modern slaughterhouses in Scotland and is heavily involved in exporting. This moring, I made inquiries there about German scaremongering. I was informed that it had about £1 million-worth of German sales in 1990, but that scaremongering then crippled that market for it. It has not suffered directly from the current situation, but made the point clearly that the longer the scaremongering goes on, the more markets—not just the German market—suffer. Word goes around and other markets—such as the French market—become concerned about whether there is something in what the Germans are saying. I hope that my hon. Friend will recognise that the National Farmers Union for Scotland is firmly behind him and his colleagues in their positive and firm rebuttal of Germany and in standing up once again for our farmers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to keep my speech incredibly brief to allow other hon. Members to speak, but I want also to men-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0154">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
tion the issue of fishing—but not the fishing issue to which reference has so far been made. I am greatly concerned about rod fishing, which produces a significant income for the economy of my constituency. I know that my hon. Friend the Minister is aware of the importance of salmon fishing, not only on the River Dee but on many east coast rivers in Scotland. He also knows of my concern that the Government should do everything possible to try to ensure that we do not damage the stock of salmon returning to those rivers. A great debate is under way about what has caused the reduction of stocks in Scottish rivers—whether it is the drift netters in the north-east of England, fish-eating birds, which can destroy some of the salmon parr, or the management of the rivers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On behalf of the fishermen in my area, I gratefully welcome the move initiated in the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Bill, in which my hon. Friend agreed to the derating of the salmon fish counter on the River Dee. Although that will not in itself directly produce benefits for the industry, it will save some £5,500 that would have been paid by the board in rates. I hope that the board will be able to plough that back into ensuring good management of the river, to ensure that stocks are optimised. The figures that I have read for the number of fish coming up the River Dee in the first four months of this year compared with last year show that the number has halved. That sparks great concern in my area for the future economy of the area relating to tourism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although my hon. Friend may not regard north-east drift netters as the sole problem, I strongly urge him to recognise that the 13 per cent. reduction in the number of those drift netters last year, resulting from phasing them out, is a reduction in numbers—not a 13 per cent. reduction in the volume of catch. That has only touched on solving the problem which, as I said, affects not just the River Dee, but all the other rivers on the east coast of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I join with my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South in recognising the significant contribution that my hon. Friend the Minister has made and is making to agriculture and fishing in Scotland by ensuring that Scottish interests are firmly to the fore. I hope that he will continue to do so at every opportunity.

I congratulate the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) on forcing this debate. I am not sure that he got the full debate that he wanted today, but he is none the less to be congratulated on forcing a debate on these extremely important matters. His first-class speech—such as he usually makes on such matters—was marred only slightly by his brazen touting for business when he said that a Queen's counsel would have to be in each and every fishing vessel. I understand that that would be worth £1,000 per trip. Perhaps we should examine the House of Commons rules to see whether we can tighten them up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate was enlivened by the Minister giving us an insight into next week's business. We attend business
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
questions every Thursday and are repelled by the Leader of the House, but the Minister has just told us that the Secretary of State for Scotland will be making a statement next week on an important matter related to these debates. Of course, he did not say who would be Secretary of State for Scotland at that time. I see some raised eyebrows on the Government Front Bench.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer again to BIV—bovine AIDS—and the milk supply. I know that it is a sensitive matter, but there seems to be a discrepancy between the treatment of the suspected condition north and south of the border. I understand from press reports that when the condition was identified south of the border, the milk board took steps to withdraw such milk from the supply, although it was contractually obliged to purchase the milk from the farmer. However, in the north-east of Scotland, milk was still being supplied from a suspected herd. The Minister has had an opportunity to familiarise himself more with the case, and I ask him in the most sensitive possible way to consider carefully the concern about the issue. People are worried about the integrity of the food chain. Given that the condition is rare, it would not be enormously difficult to treat suspected cases in a way whereby caution was the better part of valour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the hon. Gentleman see the quote in the 	<i>Press and Journal</i> from Ian Marr, the chairman of Aberdeen and District milk marketing board? He resented the hon. Gentleman's scaremongering in the matter, bearing in mind that all milk is pasteurised and rigorous testing procedures are carried out on all farm milk which must be processed through the milk marketing board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That silly intervention typifies the idea that if we shut our eyes to such problems there will be no public concern. That matter would be of interest to the press regardless of who commented on it. The hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch) did not address the substance of the issue, which is the clear discrepancy between the policies north and south of the border. Given the public concern, I believe that the policy applied south of the border is the wise one. In the most sensitive terms, I have asked the Minister to address that issue. If the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside thinks that that is scaremongering, perhaps he should revise his terminology. That silly intervention did him no credit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As many people know, I could speak on the subject of fishing for a long time, but I shall restrict myself to four issues: decommissioning; effort limitation and where that policy is going; the sectoral plan for fisheries that the Government submitted last month to the European Union; and fisheries protection. On decommissioning, the point has been well made that even on the most optimistic scenario the decommissioning expenditure will go only one third of the way towards the multi-annual guidance programme targets. That was admitted by the Minister, so he must tell us what will happen to the other two thirds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A strange argument has been offered as a defence by the Government for their failure to implement decommissioning when that should have happened and was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0155">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
supported by the Scottish Office in the late 1980s. Although there is a substantial rebate from the European Union, that does not count because it comes off the Fontainebleau settlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have hoped that a Minister with responsibility for Scottish fisheries would have made the obvious point to the Treasury Ministers that that argument could apply to any form of European Union spending. It could apply to spending on a bridge, a dam, an infrastructure project, schemes in the highlands and islands and the social fund. Those who say that are arguing against applying for any form of European Union spending across a range of issues. The argument is not specific to fishing, but is against any form of EU spending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever the former Prime Minister had in mind when she handbagged her European colleagues many years ago in the Fontainbleau agreement, surely it was not to say that it should be used for not arguing for European structural assistance across a range of issues. I would have hoped that a Scottish Office Minister in charge of fisheries would make the opposite argument rather than apparently falling into line with the narrow-minded Treasury view on those matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, with regard to effort limitation, the Minister says that because of a court case the policy has been blown off course. Indeed, it has, but the Minister has an obligation to tell us the intent of the policy. Is it to continue to pursue effort limitation dependent on the outcome of the court case, or does he have any ideas on how the MAGP targets might be met through other methods?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister knows my views on those matters, and I should like to see some determination on the part of fisheries Ministers to return to the subject of square-mesh panels. That issue was analysed in the trials which impressed on so many hon. Members representing fisheries constituencies the great advantage of a square-mesh panel in relation to fish conservation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If effort limitation was successfully argued by the Government as counting towards the targets of the MAGP, why should not square-mesh panels—which are a form of fisheries effort limitation—also count towards them? I should like the Minister with responsibility for fisheries to show solid determination to argue for that case, which is well supported by the Scottish industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had a considerable suspicion that the previous English fisheries Minister did not want to pursue that argument because he had a particular fascination with the idea of individual transferable quotas. That was his magic solution for the problems of the fishing industry. I hope that the Minister will refer to his determination to press the square-mesh panel idea as counting against MAGP targets, or at least confirm that that argument will be put to our European colleagues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, with regard to the sectoral plan, the Minister is aware of the exchange of opinion among ourselves and the Grampian region. There was great concern that
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
after the sectoral plan was finally pushed forward towards the end of May, consideration of its details seemed to show that the north-east of Scotland and the 5b area status of fisheries were not being given the same attention as was rightly being paid to the objective 1 areas in the highlands and islands. As the Minister well knows, the sectoral plan makes specific reference to the possibility of aid to construction and modernisation in Scotland, but only in the objective 1 areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also knows, as does the Minister with responsibility for industry in Scotland, that the objective 5b status was sought and won for the north-east of Scotland in many senses on the argument of fisheries dependency. It was therefore a considerable disappointment to the representatives of the north-east of Scotland to find themselves apparently neglected in the sectoral plan when it was put out to consultation. The Minister is aware that that was not just my view, but that of Grampian regional council and its fisheries committee. Although he attempted to mollify us in his reply on 28 June by saying that all of that was taken care of, I should like a firm assurance and an explanation of why aid for modernisation and construction was considered in the sectoral plan as a possibility for the objective 1 areas but not, apparently, for the 5b areas, where the bulk of the Scottish fishing industry lies. He may remember that his ministerial colleague was caught flat-footed during the European election campaign when asked to comment on the matter in Aberdeen, but seemed to give an assurance that the sectoral plan would include a commitment to the 5b areas in the north-east of Scotland. Will the Minister repeat that explicitly today?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister with responsibility for industry was helpful and supportive in respect of the original 5b application. I hope that that sympathy will continue. The Minister should not interpret my kind remarks as backing for his candidature. I have been trying to avoid imposing on him that heavy burden of support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fourth point relates to fisheries protection. The Minister may remember our exchange of views on the Government's wisdom in allowing Spanish access to fisheries waters. I recall his telling me that the Scottish fisheries protection fleet sorts out any Spanish armada that was doing what "The Cook Report" proved that Spanish boats do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister knows, in various major fishing confrontations, the Scottish fisheries protection fleet based at Leith and elsewhere has been backed up by the Royal Navy vessels based at Rosyth. Given the present argument surrounding the naval base, surely there is a strong case for suggesting that those vessels, which may be required if the Minister is serious about sorting out the Spanish armada, would be better plied from a North sea base than from a base in the English channel, as most of the controversial fisheries at stake will be those in the North sea or off the west coast of Scotland. Is there not a strong fisheries dimension to the arguments about the naval base? Is the Minister putting that case to his ministerial colleagues?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a personal level, I have the highest regard for the Minister with responsibility for fisheries in Scotland,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0156">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
but it cannot be argued that he is the Scottish Fisheries Minister. In terms of representation and policy, when the Minister is allowed to go into Europe, he goes as the second string to English Fisheries Ministers, and there is often a conflict in the attitudes and arguments put forward. On decommissioning, for example, it is my certain knowledge that the Scottish Office supported a decommissioning scheme at least from the late 1980s, yet it was 1992 before such a scheme appeared, and the strings attached to it made it extremely unpalatable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to the time when we have a Scottish Office Minister who has the freedom and manoeuver-ability to represent Scottish fishing interests without looking over his or her shoulder at superiors in Whitehall and taking account of their views on a range of fisheries matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South that the reality of power and influence in the European Union is responsible for the fact that, of all the communities and industries in Scotland, there is overwhelming support in the fishing industry for the concept of independence within Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.18 pm</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) made a familiar point, which we are used to hearing from him and his party, about the differences in interest and view between the Scottish and English fishing industries. He argued that the differences could be resolved if all the decisions were taken in Scotland. Let me point out to him, however, that there are differences of interest and of view even within the Scottish fishing industry—most notably from east coast to west coast—so simply devolving matters down to Scotland unfortunately will not overcome the problem of different fishing sectors having different views about the best way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As an example of that, I could cite a matter that I raised with the Minister in an intervention—the west coast view that a valuable instrument in the general aim of effort limitation would be a weekend ban on the prawn fisheries on the west coast. That we have not succeeded in persuading the Government to have a weekend ban until now is nothing to do with the Minister who is responsible for English fisheries or English fishing interests. It has everything to do with opposition to that notion within other sectors of the Scottish fishing industry, along with Scottish fish processors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appeal to the Minister again. I welcome his statement that he would be willing to reconsider a weekend ban, especially given that the days-at-sea restrictions have been put on hold. I draw his attention to other countries in the European Community such as Spain, where there is a regional weekend ban on fisheries in Galicia. There is no reason why, within the EC laws, we could not have a similar regional approach to effort limitation in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All hon. Members with an interest in fisheries have received a letter from the Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food about the arguments
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
over Spanish and Portuguese accession. The Minister confirmed that the Government are pursuing those arguments on the basis of the two principles of relative stability—that is, that the United Kingdom will not lose any quota—and of no overall increase in fishing effort. Those two important principles must be pursued in the accession negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We on the west coast are worried about non-pressure stocks. When the Spanish gain accession to the waters of the west coast, we know that pressure stocks will be under threat, but non-pressure stocks will be, too. The two principles put forward by the Minister do not apply to non-pressure stocks such as crab, lobster, crayfish, scallops and so on. Will the Minister give an equivalent guarantee to that given by the Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on pressure stocks? Will he guarantee that there will be no increased Spanish effort on non-pressure stocks in western waters, beyond the 12-mile limit? There is no justification for such an increase in fishing effort from the Spanish on such stocks. The country has no historical entitlement to them and they have been fished only in fairly recent times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Effort limitation is important, but equally important on the west coast is its fleet, much of which is quite old. Its boats need to be renewed, rebuilt and replaced. It has been argued that that can happen without an increase in the fishing effort. The great pressure on stocks is in the North sea rather than the west coast where there is no pressure on prawn, for example, from its total allowable catch. Nevertheless, the aging fishing fleets are being caught up in the same restrictions that affect the entire United Kingdom fishing fleet. That is why I favour a more comprehensive and generous decommissioning scheme. I do not want any members of the west coast fleet to be removed from the fishing industry, nor do I want to reduce those fleets, but a decommissioning scheme and the fulfillment by the Government of the multi-annual guidance programme will lead to a restoration of the grants and aid that will help to rebuild the west coast fleets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not only a question of rebuilding the fleets. There is a strong case also to be made for the exploitation and exploration of new kinds of fisheries. The case has been made repeatedly to the Government that they need to support exploratory voyages into the deep waters west of the Hebrides. Those waters are already being exploited by French and Spanish boats. There is no reason why we should not do so as well, but that requires assistance from the Government. Will the Minister confirm that EC grants are still available for exploratory voyages, such as those into the deep waters west of the Hebrides? If they are available, will he seek to ensure that west coast ports are able to gain access to them?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support what the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland said about fish farming. Long-term stability in the industry requires the introduction of producers' organisations. To be effective, those producers' organisations must be introduced on a statutory, not merely voluntary, basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On crofting and agriculture matters, it is important to put the amount of support given to crofting in perspec-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0157">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
tive in terms of the United Kingdom's overall support for agriculture. Agriculture support for crofting amounts to about £20 million to £25 million a year, which represents just 10 per cent. of the total grants for oilseed production alone. The proportion of agriculture support devoted to crofting is therefore very small, but it is important and valuable. In benefits about 650 townships and almost 10,000 crofting families, that support must be sustained and enhanced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister tried to suggest that the differential between the support given to hill farmers in the less advantaged areas and to other sheep farmers has not been reduced in recent years. That is not true. There was a big cut in the hill livestock compensatory allowance in the severely disadvantaged areas in 1992. To my knowledge, that cut has not yet been restored or made up. It is not good enough for the Minister to point to farmers' incomes across Scotland or the United Kingdom as a whole and to state that they have been maintained or even increased. That has not happened in the highlands and islands. We must maintain the differential in matters such as the hill livestock allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On forestry, mention has been made of the disposal programme and of the prospects for the forestry commission in terms of the statement to be made by the Secretary of State next week. I wrote to the Secretary of State recently on the related subject of the disposal of individual pieces of woodland by the forestry commission and Forestry Enterprise. The Minister may know that a controversy arose recently in my constituency, where Scottish Natural Heritage agreed to sponsor a specific woodland sale by Forestry Enterprise to the local college of further education and a local private company. It was subsequently discovered that certain directors of that local private company which received sponsorship from Scottish Natural Heritage were employees of Scottish Natural Heritage. That raises serious and obvious questions about conflict of interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister think it right that employees of Scottish Natural Heritage, of Forestry Enterprise or of any other public agency should have outside interests and or businesses of directorships with outside interests whose activities overlap directly and clearly with those of the agency by which they are employed? I do not think that that can be allowed. It must be changed. I would welcome the Minister's views on that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.31 pm</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to participate in what I consider to have been one of the best debates that I have heard since coming to this place. My hon. Friend the Minister set the standard when he opened our discussions and the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland added to the value of the debate through his well-put case, as did many other hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A marginal point with which I take issue was the contribution from the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) (who referred to milk quotas. I accept his point about fighting to hold levels of quota, but I found it slightly ironic that he suggested that my hon. Friend the Minister should argue our case vigorously and fight
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
our corner in Europe, when so often we hold our position and fight our corner but receive great criticism from Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I really wanted to deal with issues concerning fishermen and the problems that they face. They have all the problems that change brings about. Improved techniques and equipment introduce the potential for higher catches. Modern industries are required to try to improve efficiency and increase competitiveness, but there are lower stocks and to catch them takes higher levels of investment. Many hon. Members referred to there being too many boats, and to decommissioning scheme requirements. The hon. Member for Western Isles said that he did not want to take people out of fishing. Unfortunately, decommissioning means that boats are taken out. That is a sad fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an intervention during the speech of my hon. Friend the Minister I referred to the question of attracting greater amounts of cash from Europe for decommissioning. I asked whether, if we requested them, more funds would be available. Perhaps my hon. Friend could write to me if he cannot answer me now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Decommissioning and aging boats create a great contrast, and the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland and other hon. Members who referred to the aging of a fleet made good points. I will throw in an additional aspect: the existence in Scotland of the fishing boat building industry. Here, too, there is uncertainty and loss of business and, if the hon. Gentleman wants the fishing boat building industry to be sustained, the issue must be addressed when we examine decommissioning and support for the fishing industry in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another major problem facing fishermen, certainly in my constituency, is the considerable reduction in the price that they can obtain for what is often a depleted landing in case. Prices at the quayside have fallen considerably in real terms during the past 10 years. As I said earlier, business is growing harder and regulations seem to be expanding the need for cash input from the fishermen: such things as boat inspections and safety standards create additional requirements for investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I compliment my hon. Friend on the assistance he gave to the fishing industry by bringing under control the excessive demands on stern gland and bearing inspections of fishing vessels. I appreciate the interest he took at that time. However, the fishermen also sometimes feel rather aggrieved when they compare their situation to those of people in the agricultural industry; fishermen regard themselves as competitors in the food market and yet they can see their rivals in the agricultural industry picking up large amounts of subsidy which are not available to them. Rightly or wrongly, it is an issue that fishermen feel very strongly about. I also congratulate my hon. Friend on his involvement in the European negotiations which resulted in the containment of the Irish box and of Spanish and Portuguese involvement in the North sea. Fishermen, certainly in my constituency and in the Clyde estuary, were very concerned about those issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are several questions that I would like to ask. First, I ask my hon. Friend what has happened to the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0158">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
proposals of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation on alternatives to the Sea Fisheries (Wild Life) Conservation Act 1992? It has suggested that taxes be abandoned, which would make days-at-sea limitations acceptable to them. I recognise that the involvement of the European Court has thrown a spanner in the works, but we should respond to the constructive comments of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation. There is another area that concerns me and on which I am not very clear: there appears to be a European requirement for the introduction of fishing permits that would set down the time, the place and indeed the catch of fishermen. That seems to overlap with the Sea Fisheries (Wild Life) Conservation Act; would my hon. Friend comment on any knowledge that he has on that additional permit requirement, as seen through the eyes of the European Commission?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has done a good job in respect of enforcement in British waters, but could he say what attention he has given to enforcement in other European countries, particularly Spain, where it is common knowledge that undersized landings are the order of the day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many other issues that I would have liked to address; I shall perhaps take them up privately with my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary. The point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South, which was also covered by other hon. Members, was on the use of the square mesh. That is an important issue, which we should address. I would like finally to suggest to my hon. Friend, who does such a remarkably good job for Scottish fishermen, that the advice of the experts should perhaps occasionally be put aside and greater account taken of the voices of the fishermen themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.38 pm</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a valuable debate; nine contributions have been made. The Minister has been asked about 30 specific questions and for his comments on about another dozen matters; as he expects to have around ten minutes in which to reply, he has his work cut out, without anything that I might say I shall not therefore, repeat points that have already been made—certainly not at great length.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I want to begin by saying that I regret that, although my hon. Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland said that he wanted to focus the debate on fisheries matters, the Minister chose to widen it—which is perfectly in order,—to cover an even broader canvas of agricultural matters. The Committee is at its best when it focuses most sharply on limited matters. That is not to say that we should not have a debate on agricultural issues—that would be valuable as well. However, it is not possible for Back Bench Members to contribute effectively in short, 10-minute speeches in debates on such a broad canvas as that which the Minister stretched out at the beginning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to begin with two modest, specific questions, which have not been touched on. One relates to shellfish production and to aquaculture generally. At the
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
annual general meeting of the Association of Scottish Shellfish Growers, concerns were expressed that Scottish Natural Heritage was drawing up a secret list of special areas for conservation for submission to the Secretary of State and that not enough time would be available for full consultation on them. There is considerable anxiety that that could nip in the bud a valuable aquaculture development in important, sparsely populated areas of the west highlands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The special areas may be partly justified from an environmental point of view, but it is not sensible for Scottish Natural Heritage to rush into this area, as it has rushed into my constituency, damaging the forestry industry and failing to undertake proper consultation on or consideration of the economic impact of its actions. I should be reassured if the Minister undertook to consider that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second question is also of local import. Is the Minister aware of the continuing concern that the quotas affecting fishing from the western ports on the North sea, which have gone down by a third over a three-year period, are so tight that any serious interference with them would have a damaging impact on prosperous ports. It has been put to me, especially by representatives of the port of Kinlochbervie, which has been doing quite well in recent months, that some reallocation of quota between the western and eastern sectors may be necessary if there is not to be a damaging dislocation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A matter on which the Minister touched but did not expatiate is the possible use of objective 1 and objective 5b status in respect of fisheries expenditure in the areas for which those objectives have been obtained. The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan mentioned the problems under objective 5b, which are of concern in the Grampian region. There is interest and uncertainty about how those moneys might be disposed of, especially under objective 1, in the highlands. There is not a lot of money under objective 1 when it is spread over a period of years, and the costs of capital expenditure on harbours are very high. It would be wrong to build up expectations that it will make a significant difference to the condition of some of the harbours, especially those that are not owned by local authorities, such as the Wick harbour, on which only a modest amount of money has been spent for fisheries purposes and which needs a substantial amount for other purposes. Projects could be greatly assisted by capital expenditure on infrastructure, such as the deepening of the entrance to the Kinlochbervie harbour, which is too shallow for some of the vessels that have to use it. I hope that that will be considered eligible expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must turn to the wider issues raised by this debate relating to the direction of Government policy on fisheries. The core uncertainty lies in the Government's failure to implement their effort limitation policy—I accept that their failure was brought about by the English fisheries organisations. The consequence of that seems to be a policy vacuum. We do not know how the Government intend to meet the mandatory multi-annual guidance programme targets by the end of 1996. We have been advised that the modest decommissioning programme will not go anywhere near filling the gap
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0159">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
and reaching the 19 per cent. reduction that we are required to achieve. How do the Government propose to bridge that gap? A crisis should not be allowed to develop following the delivery of a judgment by the European Court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that contact has been made with fishing representatives in Scotland and that a dialogue is taking place, albeit at too leisurely a pace, on alternative fishery limitation methods, especially mesh sizes and square mesh panels, to which reference has already been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the years, our industry has lurched from one device to another in confronting the underlying and continuing problems of over extraction of stocks. That that is no less of a problem is clear from the evidence of landings, even this year. Again relying on information from my constituency, I am conscious that fishing activity is proceeding at an unprecedented and successful rate. Vessels are coming in, turning round and going straight out again, whereas a couple of years ago there were some gaps.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From what the Minister said, I do not have a sense that the Government have any conception of how they would tackle this problem. It is clear from all that we have been told that the problem should best be managed in this country as in other European countries by a proper decommissioning scheme that is predominantly financed by the European Community—to the extent of 70 per cent. I fear that the Government are storing up trouble for themselves and for the industry by not engaging now, prior to the delivery of the European Court of Justice judgment, in dialogue about alternative conservation measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.49 pm</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to all hon. Members who have contributed to a valuable debate, to which I have listened with great interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me answer first the questions about fishing. I accept that it is not easy to determine at this stage how we can meet our multi-annual guidance programme targets. I need not go into more detail about decommissioning because we shall debate that matter on Thursday. As I said, we might take out 2.5 per cent. or 3 per cent. a year and set the figure at 8 per cent. over three years. With the penalties on licensed transfers and aggregation, we hope to get to about 5 per cent. over the same period. That would mean a total of about 12 per cent. or 13 per cent., which is still a long way short of our 19 per cent. target.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why we are discussing with the industry issues such as technical conservation and mesh sizes, which the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan mentioned, relative, to square-mesh panels. However, the position on meshed panels is not as straightforward as the hon. Gentlemen suggested. I doubt whether he would get unanimity on that, even among his constituents. Every fisherman rightly has his own view on the matter. I have to try to find a solution that is acceptable to all. That is why we are in constant discussion with the SFF, which is constructive and helpful in those discussions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The concept of the 90–80 mm square-meshed panel, which was tested in Keila trials, is one of the few aspects of conservation policy which has, and has had for many years, the support of the overwhelming bulk of Scottish industry.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall include that useful information in the consultation, and I thank the hon. Gentleman for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall discuss decommissioning in detail on Thursday, when there will be an opportunity for my hon. Friend the Minister who will lead for the Government or for myself to go into the financial predictions. The matter of the Fontainbleau rebate and the bottom line of the difference between what the Government and the EC pay toward decommissioning is not as simple as the hon. Member for Dumbarton suggested. We can deal with that point in detail on Thursday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned in passing that we have a contract with the Royal Navy for Scottish fishery protection work. There is no reason that that should not be fulfilled, whatever the decision about Rosyth. I remind hon. Members that the Spanish armada is more of a problem on the west of Scotland than on the east because we are confident that we can keep the Spanish out of the North sea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland referred to PESCA, which is a useful new measure from the Community to help business development and job creation in areas dependent on fisheries. The programme has an obvious relationship with areas of Scotland and I hope that we can take advantage of that initiative. We are still discussing the details and the money that will be available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Western Isles mentioned the exploratory voyage grant that was available from the EC. Last December, the Council decided to end that provision because it was found to be ineffective. I should not expect it to be reinstated unless the hon. Gentleman can produce good reasons to put before the Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I curtailed my earlier remarks on salmon farming because of the pressure of time, but there is a crucial discussion on that matter. I do not want hon. Members to go away with the impression that nothing has been happening. I have had the most detailed discussion, as has my right hon. Friend, with the industry. As members of the Committee know, I went to Oslo to speak to the Norwegian fishing Minister, Mr. Olsen and I am going to meet him again in the autumn. The situation is better than it was a year ago because the current price is above both the reference price and the minimum import price, but I am fully aware that it could change dramatically later in the summer or in the autumn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must achieve support and unanimity of view among salmon farmers in Norway. They will meet in August to discuss the issue and, if they are prepared to consider producer organisations and other methods of

	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
regulating the industry, we must do so, too. There is no use in doing that unilaterally, because it is the increase in the number of salmon going into nets in Norway that poses a danger to the Scottish salmon fishing industry. We are, however, well aware of all the problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's comments are helpful, but will he confirm that he said that, if there was a willingness on the Norwegian part to have producer organisations, the Government would consider compulsory producer organisations in Scotland or voluntary ones with the extension rule?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not exactly what I said. I shall certainly consider the way forward carefully, once we know what the Norwegians are prepared to do. At the moment there seems to be great conflict within their industry as to the best way forward. The important thing is for both the Scottish and Norwegian industries to put fewer salmon into their nets in the next two or three years. I suspect that the increase is far exceeding what the market can stand in years to come.

Hon. Members raised the issue of the sectorial plan. I am sorry that there have been misunderstandings about the position, particularly in the Grampian area. The sectoral plan is a UK objective 1 issue and it covers fishing throughout the United Kingdom, whereas the details that we are going to feed into Grampian, and particularly the north Moray coast, are an objective 5b issue, which again is under detailed consideration. I hope that both schemes will have an effect on areas that are affected by fishing, particularly in the north-east of Scotland. We are working hard on that matter.

Several questions were raised about agriculture. We will issue a press release about the 3.8 per cent. overshoot so that the farming industry will know exactly where it stands in the coming year, when fanners are planning their cropping arrangements. I reiterate, however, that we must try to have no overshoot, and then all farmers will receive the maximum amount of money available.

We are as sympathetic as we can be to any errors in the IACS form but we are, again, limited specifically to
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
matters in which we can be flexible. That is not often possible with a European regulation.

The hon. Member for Western Isles raised the issue of the highlands and islands supplement for the HLCA. We have a firm commitment to continue with the HLCA; it is a very important grant to hill farming. In 1991, the sheep annual premium plus the highland and islands supplement was £25.42; in 1993, it was £30.79. The combined grant, therefore, of the sheep annual premium with the HLCA supplement has gone up rather than down. I appreciate the importance of that grant to crofters and I give the hon. Gentleman firm assurances that we will continue to have the HLCA. The matter has to be considered each autumn in relation to the recommendations from the hill farming committee with examines hill farming incomes and reports on them each year.

I strongly support my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on the issue of BSE. She has fought a valiant battle in Europe to show that British beef—particularly Scottish beef—has no problem at all with BSE. The way that the Germans have trumped up that problem and tried to bring the French in on their tailcoats is outrageous, but they have not succeeded. We shall go on fighting our corner as hard as we can.

I thank all my hon. Friends; I am sorry that I have been unable to reply to all their points, but farming is in good heart and we are doing our best to see that fishermen will have a good, profitable future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
