	<p>	<i>Amendment made:</i> No. 247, in page 27, line 20, after "continuing", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"until they are changed by an education authority in accordance with this Act".—[	<i>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 329, in page 27, line 20, after "continuing", insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1D) Where the arrangements for the placing of children or young persons with special educational needs in schools subsisting before the establishment of new local government areas under Part I of the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 lead, as a consequence of such establishment, to school education for such pupils belonging to the area of one education authority being provided at schools or educational establishments under the management of another education authority (in this subsection referred to as the provider authority), the education authority shall have a duty to make arrangements with the provider authority to ensure an adequate and efficient education for the child or young person with special educational needs, including an appropriate level of psychological services support and in the case of a child or young person with a record of needs, the services specified therein.".</p></blockquote>
This is one of the pivotal debates that may divide the Committee. This morning, we discussed various matters that are of interest to Christian denominations and the Minister's one-time sojourn in Catholic education. I am reminded of a quotation that is not exclusive to Catholic education, but which is most appropriate. It was written early in Christian teaching, in St. Matthew, chapter 25:
	<br><blockquote><p>"inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me."</p></blockquote>
It is appropriate to the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said in Committee on 8 March that he thought that there was adequate cover for special needs and special educational needs in the Education (Scotland) Act 1980. He stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Under section 60 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 education authorities have a duty to establish which children in their area have pronounced, specific, complex special educational needs—which, as such, require continual review—and to keep a record of needs for each such child. Under section 62, it is the duty of the education authority to make certain that its decision for a recorded child includes provision for special educational needs. All such duties will remain in force, and there is no question of their being changed."—[	<i>Official Report, 1st Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 8 March 1994; 	<i>c.</i> 918.]</p></blockquote>
That may be so, but they need to be strengthened. Provision for special educational needs should be in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1044</span>
Bill so that there is no question of any authority—or either, if there are two—being able to walk away from that duty. The amendment would ensure that. Section 60 of the 1980 Act makes it clear that the local authority shall have the duty to ascertain which children in its area have special educational needs, interestingly, section 61 of the Act provides that parents shall be duty bound—they will be liable to a fine of £10—to ensure that their children attend any psychological or medical examination as the authority considers necessary to ascertain whether they have special needs. I spent almost 15 very happy years teaching in a school for children with special educational needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will be as delighted as I am that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The word "deprecate" is not the sole preserve of a chairperson, so I say that I, too, deprecate that sort of intervention. It was a silly comment, especially as I spent so much time in this area of education. It trivialises the subject—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. It would help the Committee if there were fewer interruptions from the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson). I am trying to listen to the debate. An occasional interruption is understandable, but constant barracking is extremely annoying. The subject is worthy of better behaviour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No one should make sedentary interventions. I hope that as a result of the hon. Gentleman's point of order, they will cease on both sides of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that having to be here late at night can be trying and that people try to raise spirits with a bit of humour and intervention, but I believe that this is a serious subject to which members of the Committee should pay attention in the afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It took such a long time for the United Kingdom to charge the Warnock commission with the duty of considering seriously the needs of children who were not catered for in the mainstream of the education system. It was a long process. I had tremendous hopes for the recording of special needs and the rights that that would bring. I looked forward to reaching the position in which—we are not quite there yet in Scotland, but we are getting there—most children with learning difficulties who were either physically or intellectually challenged would get adequate support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 61 was included because it was thought, correctly, that many parents would feel that the recording of special needs was a stigma rather than a gateway to progress. The good thing is that parents are resisting the process less and less. It can be an emotional strain to realise that one's child has a special need and should be recorded as being different from others and given special attention. But now many parents see it as a gateway to provision. I hope to be able to show that that is because
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0580">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1045</span>
provision has grown with the realisation that those needs exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parents may be afraid of taking that step because of their emotions, because of embarrassment or because of the social mores of our society, so we should encourage them not to baulk at that emotional hurdle, to go through that gate and to give their child access to the support that is currently available and is improving day by day. If we do not do that, and if they fear that if they go through that. gate, they will have a label round their necks, but no extra facilities and inadequate provision, we shall have done a great disservice to those children, to those parents, to the work of the Warnock commission and to all the people who have tried to implement its report with all its great difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 62(1)(d) of the 1980 Act as amended in 1981—I presume that the Minister was referring to that version and not to the original—says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and the education authority may thereafter decide that the child requires special education".</p></blockquote>
That is the reality; it "may" decide. There is no compulsion, there is no objective standard that can be laid down and there are no legal rights, such as those to which the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) referred. There are standards; it is a qualitative process. They can vary if there is no universal provision and if there is no agreement to scale up the resources to cope with the many and varied difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to give way because this morning, I was pushed on by my Whip, as is his duty, and I did not allow hon. Members to intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman speaks about a universal provision. Right now, with the split in the regions, we do not have that, but there is a sympathetic provision across the existing councils. If the hon. Gentleman is aware of differences between the regions, perhaps he could bring that out in his comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is well made, but it is based on an inadequate perception of how special education has grown from the Warnock commission days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision introduced after the Warnock commission has grown because of the involvement of a group of professional people throughout Scotland. I do not have a detailed knowledge of England and Wales, except through the Socialist Education Association, but I think that an attempt has been made across the United Kingdom to produce a growth in specialisms and professional support. The career pattern of such people often shows that they have transferred back and forth across the regions of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those people, like the directors of education to whom we referred earlier, have grown professionally, not because of statute, but because of the way in which the service has developed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Something similar happened to professionals in special educational provision. Tables 9 and 10 in the Scottish Office statistical bulletin of August 1992 give an analysis of the increase of professionals in the service between 1981 and 1991. It is interesting that for 1981, which was
	<span class='label label-info column'>1046</span>
some time after Warnock but when we were beginning to get up speed in responding to Warnock, there are no entries for some of me categories of employment. A series of employment categories for non-educational services are blank—such as doctors, nurses, psychiatrists, physiotherapists, and speech dierapists. We were beginning to develop an integrated service. Other categories such as auxiliaries and trained nursery nurses changed year by year. The number of professionals working in the education authority special schools increased from 909 in 1981 to 1,324.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that growth in the body of professionals came me growth that I witnessed in the quality, range and intensity of support. At the special school, Dawson park school in Central region, for children who would now be described as mildly intellectually challenged but were men called mildly handicapped, I was the first secondary teacher to set up a social studies programme. Some of the children were not intellectually but physically challenged and had no access to a secondary curriculum at standard or higher grades. Some of the physically handicapped children who left that school with qualifications at higher level would not have had the chance before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thank goodness we have at least now found ways of integrating all those physically challenged children into mainstream secondary schools. However, many other children left in the schools are intellectually challenged and now have a broad curriculum, with a broad range of specialisms. With that comes a broad range of support from educational psychologists and physiotherapists. The Minister with responsibility for health at the period I am discussing set aside £2 million for speech therapy, so important and so undeveloped was that specialism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The good book, to quote from it again, tells us that as
	<br><blockquote><p>"a man soweth, that shall he also reap."</p></blockquote>
We now see the Government sowing the wind and reaping the whirlwind. They are disaggregating services, although a body of knowledge and specialisms is what carries guarantees for all children in a broad area. If that is broken down, the necessary numbers—the critical mass that permits all the specialisms and responses required—is lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that we are debating this subject today. I notice that I am the only one still wearing the sticker and ribbon from yesterday. We saw yesterday that people with disabilities are not necessarily disabled: they are disabled by disabilities if they do not overcome them. The visit yesterday by people who came to lobby Parliament and to persuade hon. Members from all parties to vote tomorrow for the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill was moving, heartwarming and encouraging. People came from Strathclyde. I noticed that my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South (Mr. McMaster) was with the Strathclyde Disability Alliance yesterday. Despite physical disabilities those people had travelled overnight by train to articulate their needs. That is what special education is about—making sure that people overcome disabilities, that persons with recorded needs within the terms of the Act may have their record of needs set down and that the authority will allocate the required resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have filled in such documentation for children many times. When a small authority such as my result from the disaggregation examines its budget and the numbers of people in its area—and I believe that there are six educational psychologists for all of Eastwood—will it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0581">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1047</span>
really be able to carry out the duties that we should want it to carry out? Under the 1980 Act they can walk away from those duties. They can decide they will not record, because they know that the resource statement will bring it decisions for resources that they do not have. Our amendment clearly states that the authority which has the duty of looking after a child will ensure that the provider authority will provide the right resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no get-out. There is a clear link in the amendment: when an authority says that the special provision is needed, it will contract or get into a relationship with another authority to ensure that it is carried out. We disagree with the nonsense that has been created, anyway. The boundary-driven local authority reorganisation will decimate the reality for people that need resources to have their needs met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quoted the Bible this morning, in another context:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Father, forgive them: for they know not what they do."</p></blockquote>
That might be all right for the Minister, but I want to know where are the people in St. Andrew's house that I talked to as a special education teacher, president of the Education Institute of Scotland in central Scotland. Where are those people who talked about Warnock in a lucid and clear fashion? Where were we when the Minister was driven into this black hole of despair that engulfs a lot of people in Scotland in these little authorities? They go through the emotional process of saying that they accept that their children are to be recorded and at the end of it have no guarantee that they will get anything other than a badge that says, "I am disabled", "I am handicapped" or "My child is handicapped or disabled", because, as the Act stands, there is no guarantee of resources and there is no guarantee in the Bill that the resources will be provided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening to the hon. Gentleman's argument. No one doubts his commitment, and it is unfortunate that his hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) is not present to hear the hon. Gentleman's speech. Would he quantify the critical mass of which he speaks? Does not he agree that while the critical mass is important, it will still be there after reorganisation because of the size of some of the larger authorities that will be created? It will still be there if two or three of the smaller authorities get together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that, despite some of the behaviour of the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South, under that mauve shirt ticks a heart, beating slightly. Years of being a teacher did not drive away all his compassion. The reality is what happens in disaggregation. For example, what will happen if Stirling gets together with Perth? It is 58 miles from Balfron high school to Perth. It is not possible for people to feel that they are within a community and near the provider if that is the case. From Alva or any part of the north of Clackmannan, should it stand alone and take services from Glenrothes, with the best will in the world it is 30 miles or more away from the provider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More importantly—my point this morning stands the test—lest anyone thinks that there is spare capacity in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1048</span>
larger authorities, for example in the Falkirk area, the leaders of any of the specialities in central Scotland will say that they have dozens of children at this moment who are getting less than the kind of provision that they would wish to give. If any capacity is freed-up by division, it will be sucked immediately into the needs of the people within Falkirk. Is the Minister with responsibility for education, who sometimes shows compassion, saying that he wants to have more people on the payroll? We would like that, but we will hear from the Minister with responsibility for development that there is no money to pay for them and that extra resources are not available because there is no money for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman. I am not hostile to much of what he says. However, I wish that he would not go into the problems of geography. Any hon. Member who represents a large constituency such as mine, can say that, for example, it is a long way from Bridge of Gaur or Rannoch to Perth, both of which at present are in Tayside region. Hon. Members with large rural constituencies understand the problem. We believe that it can be overstated: for us it exists already, under a system that the hon. Gentleman claims works.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that, in a sense, the hon. Gentleman was trying to be helpful. He succeeded: the point of the amendment is to ensure that the primacy of the recording authority will go with the primacy of the deliverer. In a partnership the person in the smaller, recording authority will be secondary in the developed remit of the provider authority, or of the provider-contractor, whatever that contractor may be. We want the Bill to provide that that primacy will come together, so that if a person has a special need in a small district, it will be the district's responsibility to ensure that the resources to meet that need will be provided by the provider authority. There is no question of anyone walking away from the responsibility: we want to bring the two responsibilities together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall conclude with a couple of statistics. It is important to make clear the scale of the problem, and I make no apologies for citing central Scotland, which is the area that I know best. The education budget in that region is £8,231,000. It has been calculated that, if Stirling wished to match that budget, an additional £162,000 would be needed. My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell), quite rightly, kept pressing the Minister to say whether extra resources would be provided and whether an extra £162,000 would be provided to Stirling to make sure that services remain the same. If such extra resources are not made available, there will be a diminution of services. The amendment would ensure that the children who need support most desperately would not suffer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will be the costs for a Stirling stand alone authority? At present provision for the deaf in central Scotland consists solely of Windsor Park in Falkirk, where it costs £14,768 per pupil to attend. If Stirling has the majority of children who are recorded as having special needs because of hearing impairment, and if Falkirk decides it wants to find another way of providing for them, will Stirling set up another Windsor Park, with all the associated costs, and will the Minister fund it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0582">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1049</span>
The only centre for cerebral palsy in central Scotland is the Charles Brown unit at Fallin. It is an excellent unit which has developed its own specialist treatments. Its staff includes educational psychologists and people who can deal with all associated problems. It costs £12,911 per pupil at that unit. I taught at Dawson Park for nearly 15 years. The average cost there is £14,768 per child. Many of those children come from Stirling district, so the question of whether Stirling will have sufficient resources to provide for them is very important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The broad psychological services for 350 children with a record of needs in central Scotland costs £200,000. Twenty-one psychologists are involved, 10 of whom specialise in areas as diverse as visual impairment to cerebral palsy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Disaggregation will mean a loss of rights. The 1980 Act, as amended in 1981, offers no defence. Clauses 60 and 62 are not enough. Perhaps we should leave emotion behind and let our heads rule our hearts. The Bill should ensure that there is no way for a provider authority or for the authority in which a child lives to slip out of their responsibilities. Only in that way can we stay in line with the Warnock spirit, thinking about the child and not about the political cost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon McMaster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) has a great interest in these matters. He gave a good potted account of the problems with the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am secretary of the all-party disablement group. I have had correspondence—as I suppose that all members of the Committee have—from Hugh Stewart of Enable, who raises some pertinent questions. He is generally interested in the services provided and has no other axe to grind. On the eve of the debate on the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill, it would be wrong not to mention the lobby yesterday, when disabled people campaigned for the Bill. They are making it clear that they want to be treated as full and equal citizens. There is broad support for disabled people to be treated as such, but for that support to be meaningful, such treatment must start at the earliest stage, during the school years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past 20 years, the provision of services for disabled people and children has improved. That is a significant comment to make because we spend a lot of time in the policial knockabout, saying that everything has got worse in the past 20 years. I must make the qualification, however, that things could have got a whole lot better with more funding. Attitudes have changed in the education service and among disabled people. As we saw yesterday, that means that pressure has been put on the Government. That makes it difficult for the Government—any Government—to resist such pressure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past 20 years, educational provision for young disabled children has not improved. The service is now beginning to show signs of strain. The Bill will add considerably to that because it does not include any guarantees on that service. Many examples prove that strain, but I shall give one only. The number of appeals concerning children with records of special educational needs has increased greatly. That may be because people are becoming more aware of those services or of their rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1050</span>
Problems have also been imposed by Government policy, such as those resulting from league tables. A dichotomy exists because current thinking in the education of disabled children aims to maximise integration. My hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East would agree that where there is a need for special and residential schools, there has been a move towards integration. School league tables do not take account of the money put into schools because the money does not necessarily show a benefit in schools where disabled children—young, mentally handicapped children or intellectually challenged children or whatever the term—attend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are arguing that the special measures needed to protect disabled children should be included in the Bill. Real problems exist. The hon. Member for Tayside, North commented on geography. It is common for children to travel long distances to attend special schools. Even if they attend normal schools, for part of the week they may attend another school to use specialist equipment that it might have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Residential schools may cover large catchment areas. By their very nature, they are residential and can cover a large catchment area. The Bill poses a particular problem. What if that residential school finds itself in a small authority? I ask the hon. Member for Tayside, North to accept that this is a genuine point about geography. How can the residential school cope with the co-funding? There should be provision in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will realise that my constituency has a residential school because of the distances that children have to travel to Aberfeldy. Also, some of the island communities have to send their children to residential schools. Those communities are single authorities with responsibility for education. Although the argument about the size of the authority may have some validity, one must not think that such examples do not exist now. There are residential schools in what the hon. Gentleman would consider to be small authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that there are some problems, but that is not a good reason for multiplying those problems a hundredfold by having many small authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The thrust of my argument is that the clause allows authorities to do many things, but it does not guarantee that those things will be done. That is the basic philosophical difference between the Opposition and the Government. Some children have complex disabilities—they may be deaf and blind or autistic—but those complex disabilities are not found widely in the population. Therefore, the catchment area for the provision of services for those children is necessarily wide. How will the Minister guarantee that services for such children will be provided by small local authorities? If a small authority inherits a school that has a large geographical catchment area, what guarantees will be in place to ensure that those services will continue to be provided?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That problem does not cover residential schools only. In my constituency, Strathclyde regional council runs
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0583">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1051</span>
Gateside school for the deaf, which is an excellent school. It covers an area far wider than Paisley and even Renfrew district. Children come to the school from east Renfrewshire, from Eastwood, Inverclyde and sometimes even from Dumbarton. For the past couple of years, the school has faced a problem because it has not been able to secure the services of an audiologist. If that is the current position, how will it be improved by reorganisation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have received many letters from parents of children and the teachers at Gateside. They are worried about whether the school will continue to exist, if the Bill is accepted unamended. I ask the Minister to give those parents a guarantee that those fears are not well founded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Corseford school for spastics is on the edge of my constituency. It is run by the Scottish Council for Spastics, which covers the whole of Scotland and provides residential care for children with cerebral palsy. What guarantees are there that the council will receive the funding that it needs to provide that care?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of us will be aware of the problem that arose with speech therapists. Parents had to take education authorities to court before anything was done. The Glasgow 	<i>Evening Times</i> is to be complimented on its campaign, which resulted in the Government finding an additional £2 million to deal with that problem. That type of case will be multiplied unless guarantees are written into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to keep everyone else quiet because we then start digressing. I shall have to discipline myself so I shall follow the example of the most experienced member of the Committee and make my final points in the form of questions. My first question to the Minister is about what will happen when a small authority inherits a school that provides services for disabled children from a far larger area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, is it not more likely that there will be an increase in the number of residential schools? If there are more small authorities that are jointly funding and trading between themselves, they may be able to provide residential care. Residential care is expensive, so will there be a commensurate increase in funding?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, what guarantees will there be for voluntary organisations that provide funding in one local authority, which has a far wider catchment area?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, what are the guarantees for children attending special schools outwith their areas? We want guarantees similar to the ones on denominational education. Those were inadequate, but as I do not imagine that the Minister will give anything more on this issue, we want at least the same guarantees as those on denominational education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fifthly, what will happen to the regional psychological services? How will the shadow authorities in Strathclyde resolve the issue of the provision of existing psychological services, and what arrangements will be made for the transition?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My sixth question is again about transitional costs. Will there be transitional central core funding for the specialised services that are currently in place?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have two more brief questions. What will be the requirement to publish the plans and policies for the provision of education for children with special needs and must those plans and policies include at least a statement on the relationship with neighbouring authorities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1052</span>
Finally, what is the complaints and appeals procedure when parents feel the provision of service is inadequate?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to the Minister's answers to those questions. I hope to see him in the Lobby tomorrow when we vote on the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What would the amendment mean for flexibility at local level? I ask that because I have not always been totally happy with some of the changes in education. I am not convinced that every child should go to the local school. Children with special problems should be given special care and treatment. There are special schools in my constituency which have done a remarkable job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to lower the tone of the debate, but I have always been worried that a child with special needs who goes to an ordinary school could be classified as the school daftie. We all know that children can be cruel. Children may take a long time to recover from such a handicap and, indeed, some may never recover. Therefore, we must think carefully before suggesting that we fix in concrete a certain system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that other hon. Members have in their constituencies, as I do, children who require special treatment and that they have had to fight hard to ensure that they are given the attention that they merit. I include among such children the very bright and talented who are sometimes called dafties because they are too bright to be understood by their contemporaries. It is not a simple matter to deal with such special problems and the unique situations that arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recall one individual at my school who was deemed to be daft. He turned out to be deaf and, academically, was the most gifted child in the class. If I recall correctly, he ended up with a double first, yet he was considered daft as a five or six-year-old just because he could not hear. We need flexibility in education to deal with such matters. I hope that when my hon. Friend comments on the amendment, which deals with fundamental principles about what we do for our young people, he will reply to my points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Tayside, North said, the amendment is fundamental. I want to speak about three matters: psychological services, HIV and the central subject of music teaching.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, what does the Minister regard as the minimum population necessary to sustain an educational psychological service? Does he believe that a service of fewer than 10 educational psychologists is viable? In Lothian, the policy has been to provide an integrated assessment service in psychology and related areas equally to all parts of the region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Association of Scottish Principal Psychologists states that a full service can be provided only where a population is greater than 115,000 people. That would result in a service of 10 psychologists, which would allow the necessary specialisations, for example, physical disabilities, sensory impairments, learning difficulties and emotional or behavioural difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The service in Lothian has 39 psychologists, who are well distributed. Features include highly specialised testing kits which cost up to £1,000 each; specialist expertise in the great majority of childhood disabilities;
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0584">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1053</span>
access to specialists in other parts of the region for children, no matter which part of Lothian they live in; and a fully integrated service which is efficient, avoids planning duplication and responds to national initiatives. Staff are able to develop great expertise in their field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of my constituency experience, I am very impressed by the service that Lothian region has developed. I want to ask six questions about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, how could a psychological service be organised in smaller areas, such as that represented by my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson)? On the basis of expert advice, it would not be viable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not a hope.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, would it be necessary to return to the pre-1975 position when special needs children had to go to Edinburgh corporation for assessment and education? I remember the difficulties with that. For 13 years, I represented an area in which great problems were created.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, would children with an unusual condition receive the expert attention that they receive currently?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, how could the current level of expertise be sustained?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fifthly, how could the current efficient service be maintained with so much time needed for inter-authority co-ordination? The Government have reckoned that the inter-authority co-ordination will take far less time than is the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sixthly, given that the critical mass of a psychological service consists of 10 staff, what would happen to psychological services in authorities with fewer than 115,000 people in their area?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is vital that the education of children with disabilities or learning difficulties is not disrupted by the reform process, for example, by disputes between councils about which pays or how much a service should cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 32(2)(1C) allows local authorities to continue such arrangements, but there is no guarantee that they would do so. The amendment would place a stronger duty on a child's council, but, ideally, we would like a duty to be placed on the council that takes over existing services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another issue is children with rare or complex disabilities. One group most at risk is children with very specialised or intensive needs—for example, those who are both deaf and blind and those with autism. Often, few such children live in an area and services are organised on a regional basis. Many of the new councils will not be big enough to deliver high quality services to those groups or to employ specialist staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, each year—I shall do so next Wednesday—I take round pupils from the Windy Knowe primary school in Bathgate and pupils from Donaldson's school for the deaf. I know something about the subject at first hand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A legal duty may still exist to meet a child's needs, but it will rely on provision from other councils with no duty to that child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1054</span>
The recent problems with speech therapy show what can go wrong. Education authorities had a duty to secure speech therapy for children with special needs, but the therapists were employed by health boards. Many boards could not or would not provide the therapists and parents were forced to take legal action against the education authorities. It was only after a major campaign by the Glasgow 	<i>Evening Times</i> that the Government stepped in and an extra £2,000,000 was found.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A particular danger is posed when a specialised service is inherited by a small authority that may be unable to meet the core costs, with only the hope that other councils will buy the service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When there is co-operation, it is extremely difficult to imagine that such arrangements could promote locally based education with proper support. Instead, what is likely to happen is that more children will be sent away to residential schools, losing contact with their family and community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister says that he has replied to many of those points in his letter of 8 March—I shall be brief for the sake of the Committee—I should simply throw back to him a letter from Mr. Chant, the director of social work in Lothian region, who said that that letter of 8 March was bland. I fear that the replies that we have had so far from the Minister have been very bland—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I am cutting much of my speech because of the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must refer to the brief dated 2 February that we have all received from Bamardos, which mentioned:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The loss of such could well result in social work in general and the needs of children in care in particular being marginalised. Barnardo's believes strongly that we must retain an effective body of knowledge at both Officer and Member levels. Following Orkney, the Directors of Social Work together published a Report on child abuse/protection, Barnardo's at UK national level have publicly commented that this is the most authoritative and knowledgeable report published to date on this highly complex and difficult subject."</p></blockquote>
It also expresses its concern about the Bill, as do the British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering which state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Our Medical Committee in Scotland have expressed deep concern that the person vested with such responsibility might not be professionally qualified in social work. It is our understanding that in a significant number of cases, the evidence and supporting papers for and against the recommendations from the Panels have to be carefully scrutinised by the Director before a decision to support or overturn the recommendation is reached. It would be worrying if this responsibility was to be vested in someone who was not professionally qualified in social work."</p></blockquote>
It shares my concern and that of my hon. Friends about the provisions of psychologists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the sensitive subject of HIV and AIDS. Does the Minister agree that an effective HIV and AIDS strategy must rely heavily on education? If so, is he prepared to make HIV and AIDS education a duty on authorities. If not, how can he ensure that it is provided?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of HIV concerns everyone in Lothian, both as individuals and as a community. The Lothian strategy—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt, but the amendment deals with special needs education. The hon. Gentleman might usefully make his remarks about HIV, and about music, in the clause stand part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to follow your advice, Sir James, only amendment No. 329 does state that

	<span class='label label-info column'>1055</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"the education authority shall have a duty to make arrangements with the provider authority to ensure an adequate and efficient education for the child".</p></blockquote>
I accept your guidance, however, and shall raise the matter in the clause stand part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I echo what the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) has said? I hope that the Minister will answer his questions. Will the new system mean more residential schools, or more court cases to get action for exceptional children? In other words, will more restricted access mean that services will be squeezed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By definition, special local government educational needs require greater resources. They involve fewer pupils and more teacher input. The problem is one of scale. Given the move from larger to smaller regions, there cannot but be doubts about the provision of these specialised services. What reassurances can the Minister give about specialist provision in the new smaller authorities? At present, every regional authority operates a special educational needs service that offers a wide range of provision. That provision is based on size. Can the Minister guarantee that that provision will continue on the smaller scale of the new authorities? The provision includes, as well as teaching and ancillary staff, the screening services to assess children with problems. On what basis does the Minister believe that the services will not be affected by the proposed major changes? Will he explain what sort of complaints and appeals procedure will be available if parents feel dissatisfied after the changes are implemented?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to respond to the debate. As a local councillor I served on the Trefoyle school committee. That school worked with children who suffered as a result of thalidomide. I also made a practice of visiting many schools catering for many types of learning difficulties. Those schools included Donaldson's College for the Deaf and the Royal Blind School in Edinburgh, Cherry Bank special school in Perth, Struan house special school for autistic children in Alloa, Kingslea special school in Aberdeen, the Craighalbert centre in Cumbernauld, Oaklands school in Edinburgh, which is linked to Telford, Drylaw special school in Edinburgh, and the Isobel Mair special school in Eastwood. Some years ago, I also visited the Westerlea school for spastics. The standards at those schools were high.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Three impressions were made on me. First, there is a wide variation in the conditions and types of learning difficulty that must be catered for. Secondly, the children in those schools were happy and fulfilled—a fact that was important for their parents, who were much happier knowing that the best was being done for their children. Thirdly, it is extremely important to provide information to parents. In that connection, it is worth noting that parents of children with special educational needs will still be able to get full information about the available provision for their children after the local goverment reforms are implemented. New arrangements for local government boundaries will mean that the Department for Education list G, which details the provisions in Scotland for pupils with special education needs, will have to be revised. We have begun discussions with the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1056</span>
Association of Directors of Education in Scotland to consider how to extend the information in list G. Recent initiatives in education have increased significantly the information available for parents. The necessity for schools to produce handbooks containing a description of available needs provision will be invaluable for parents of children with special educational needs who must decide which school is best before and after local government reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Linlithgow spoke about speech therapy. As he said, an additional £2 million has been made available. The hon. Gentleman may wish to know that a further £1 million is to be made available in 1994–95 following a detailed study of the demand for speech therapy, which was undertaken by COSLA and the health boards. This extra sum has been widely welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Overall spending on special educational needs provision has increased enormously. In 1979, it was £29 million; it increased to more than £133 million in 1992–93, which reflects the importance that is attached to it. We also provide an additional £9 million for research and development in special educational needs. The total is therefore well above £ 140 million a year, and the Scottish Office Education Department will continue to make provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are consulting on a draft circular, the final version of which will be issued in due course. The hon. Member for Falkirk, East will be pleased to know that in January we issued a draft circular containing detailed guidance on the issue of provision throughout Scotland, including the recording arrangements. The consultation ends in April; we shall study responses carefully before we issue the final circular. The objective is to unify provision in line with good practice and statutory procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Special educational needs children, including those with disabilities or learning difficulties, must not have their education disrupted, nor must they be required to change schools simple because of reorganisation. I assure hon. Members that this will not happen as a result of the proposed changes. Section 1 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 places on an education authority a duty to ensure adequate and efficient provision of school education in its area. It is defined expressly to include provision for special educational needs, and will continue when the Bill is enacted. Similarly, section 62(3) of the 1980 Act lays a specific duty on an education authority to make provision for special educational needs of recorded children, and recorded young persons, in its area. The duty, which is not limited to what is specified in the record, will also continue. The Opposition's amendment would impose a limit on what was specified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under existing legislation, pupils attending a school at the time of reorganisation will be entitled to continue their education at the school even if, as a result of reorganisation, the school is located in another authority's area. Such pupils may be excluded only on disciplinary grounds. Arrangements are already made in statute under which an authority in whose area a pupil lives must reimburse another authority that provides school education for the pupil. If there is disagreement over costs, there is provision for the Secretary of State to decide. Clause 32 will enable new arrangements for cross-border provision of education to be made, and old arrangements to continue. Such procedures are not exclusive to children with special educational needs. Other children may be in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0586">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1057</span>
a similar position and, as I have said, their continued education will be guaranteed by existing provisions. I emphasise that guarantee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For children with records of needs, the authority to whose area the child belongs will retain the duty to ensure that the child's special educational needs, as defined by the record, are fully provided for. To discharge that duty, an authority will have to ensure that the school being attended is able to do that, and that it is nominated in. part 6 of the record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes: 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is being helpful, but could he clarify one point? For example, let us assume that there are three authorities in Ayrshire and that there is a special school in North Ayrshire, which is classified as the appropriate school for a child from South Ayrshire. Is South Ayrshire obliged to pay the costs for that child? That is the key question, but the one that the Minister has not answered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many of the same considerations apply as arise in general. [HON. MEMBERS: "Yes or no?"] Let me explain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Special schools making provision for children and young persons with special educational needs are not being relocated. Children with such needs will be living in the same location. It follows that travel to the school should be more or less the same before and after local government reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When special schools or units have relatively large catchment areas that involve longer journeys for children, that will, as now, be taken into account in the annual settlement agreed between the authorities and the Scottish Office. Distribution reflects the different needs of rural areas and takes into account the number of recorded children and young persons in an authority's area. Therefore, those authorities under greatest pressure on account of transport costs for recorded pupils will receive a settlement that reflects that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that information on travel costs, but it was not the question that I asked. If a child with special needs from one authority is classified so that he goes to a special school under another authority, there is a payment from one authority to the other. Is the authority in whose area the child lives required to pay the other authority the cost of educating that child? That is the crucial question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill provides for full reimbursement of costs by the authority for the area in which the child resides. That is the answer: payment will be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Several hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Must be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a crucial issue. I understand what the Minister is saying. If there is an agreement between the two authorities about the level of payment and there is an agreement to pay, I understand that payment will be made. However, let us suppose that the new South Ayrshire authority says "Look, we cannot afford to pay
	<span class='label label-info column'>1058</span>
that: we are cutting back because we are an enabling authority", and refuses to pay, how can the parents or someone representing the child's interests ensure that the authority pays for the special education that the child needs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is in section 23(2) of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980. In disputes of that type, the Secretary of State would be the arbiter. As I said in relation to other matters, that section states that the Secretary of State may
	<br><blockquote><p>"if a claim therefor is made within the prescribed period, recover from that other authority such contributions in respect of such provision as may be agreed … or, in default of such agreement, as may be determined by the Secretary of State, who shall have regard to the estimated cost".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, the Secretary of State is in a position to determine the issue in the event of disagreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) that there has been positive co-operation between authorities in the past. That will and should continue.

The hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North asked what would happen if the duties were not implemented. Under section 70 of the 1980 Act a complaint can be made to the Secretary of State who can, by order, require that the duty be discharged. It is not just a question of duties being in statute: they have to be implemented. Under the law of the land, the Secretary of State can insist that that happens.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to refer to the question from my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley. We understand that a local authority will be obliged to provide an appropriate place for a child, but will parents have any choice about the school to which the child is sent? Will children from my hon. Friend's constituency continue to attend the other Ayrshire school, which they attend at the moment, or might they be sent to the cheapest available alternative, perhaps in another part of the country altogether?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. This issue is determined by the needs of the child concerned. Parents will be able to make placing requests for their children to be educated in a school that is managed by an authority outwith the area under which they are covered. Authorities are under a duty, with certain exceptions, to place the child accordingly. That will provide the means of access for children to the nearest and most appropriate school, even when it lies within the area of another education authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not it the case that the notion of parental choice is one that the Government have introduced over recent years against, at times, opposition from others?

	<br><blockquote><p>"If you consider any one of these options would be best for your child, you may make a request to that effect. If the education authority do not agree to place your child there, you can refer the decision to your local appeals committee.

	<span class='label label-info column'>1059</span>
It continues at the bottom of the page that the education authority
	<br><blockquote><p>"must accept your request unless it can be shown that it is not reasonable to grant it, having regard to the extra benefit which is likely to result from the school placement proposed by you compared with the extra cost."</p></blockquote>
Section 4 of the Education (Scotland), Act 1980, as amended by the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986, already provides that it shall be the duty of every authority to provide for its area a psychological service, with certain specified functions for children with special educational needs.

For all of those reasons, I suggest that the amendment is unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the process is not carried out as we believe that it should be and the inspectors carry out their inspections, we will be able to earmark funding.

We would take appropriate action if there were signs that the process was not being properly carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have visited many schools—no doubt, I shall visit many more—I must tell the hon. Member for Linlithgow that I believe that local authorities are sincere in their resolve, dedication and willingness to ensure that the matters are treated absolutely seriously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government are not serious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must tell the hon. Member that the funding figures speak for themselves. They have increased enormously over the past 10 years and, as I mentioned, more than £140 million is being provided. That is a healthy trend because of the different types of special learning difficulties covered. I have every reason to suppose that the commitment to special education needs will be every bit as strong in the future as it has been in the past few years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am greatly disturbed by what I have just heard. The Minister's comments on special education concern me. At the moment, with a relatively small number of large authorities, each makes provision for special education in several areas within its own boundaries. There are cross-boundary arrangements, which the Minister described, but there are not many. The arrangements between the regional councils are well established and work on a co-operative basis, creating few problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen in future? We shall have 30 authorities. Each one will not be able to offer the full range of provision, so the number of cross-boundary arrangements will increase tenfold or hundredfold. Such a huge increase will create many administrative and bureaucratic problems, with bills being sent backwards and forwards and attempts made to find appropriate
	<span class='label label-info column'>1060</span>
placements for the children involved. I foresee problems, especially in cases such as the one that I described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose, heaven forbid, there were three authorities in Ayrshire and one, the present Kyle and Carrick authority, for example, was Tory controlled. The schools to which the children would go might be in the new North or East Ayrshire authority or in another local authority. One of those right-wing, reactionary Tory authorities, which might be trying to cut expenditure, may be unwilling to pay the cross-boundary fees. That would be bad enough if children without learning or other difficulties were involved but the parents of children with learning difficulties and disabilities have enough problems without having to face the bureaucratic difficulties that I have described. The Minister has given no reassurances on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I graduated in psychology and I was disappointed that the Minister did not deal with that provision. As my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow and others have said, there is a critical mass in relation to the number of psychologists who can provide the range of services efficiently and effectively—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a serious matter; psychological services are vital. The Minister did not respond to the point that a number of smaller authorities will be unable to provide a full range of psychological services. On two counts, the Minister's replies have been most inadequate. Perhaps he will try again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On psychology, the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986 amended section 4 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 to require that
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of every education authority to provide for their area a regional or island authority psychological service in clinics or elsewhere, and the functions of that service shall include … provision of special education for such children".</p></blockquote>
That is a duty and, as I explained, if duties are not followed, the Secretary of State can take further action to require that they are implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to the hon. Member for Paisley, South and to my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North that there is no evidence from the current arrangements that children located within small authorities fare worse than those within larger areas. Indeed, authorities already provide services for children with special educational needs. There is a long and reassuringly successful history of such arrangements having worked well and I could give many examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A substantial range of new provisions exist to ensure that children with special educational needs have the best possible support. These provisions and the corresponding duties on authorities will continue unchanged by reorganisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a Member of Parliament representing an Edinburgh constituency, the Minister knows that the issue of HIV concerns everyone in Lothian, as individuals and as part of the community. The council's strategy is to provide information, co-ordinate services and plan for future needs. Prevention and care are closely linked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know about Lothian's work at first hand, and I am greatly impressed by the sensitivity and effectiveness of the teachers involved. Lothian features highly successful conferences of fifth year pupils—4,500 a session; good information; training for staff; education on the subject in all areas of the region; teaching staff who are specialists for different stages; support for schools, and a unique HIV-AIDS drama project for 13 and 14-year-olds. Lothian has seen the beneficial effect of helping young people make responsible lifestyle decisions as well as increased awareness among them of the implications. The region also uses speakers who are HIV positive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will effective HIV-AIDS education be available in all parts of the new authorities? Will each authority have at least one member of staff to co-ordinate AIDS initiatives? Will there be a narrower focus on deprived inner-city areas, and will the different projects be continued by the new councils? Will children get HIV-AIDS education from teachers experienced with their stage of education, and will the spread of AIDS continue to be checked by educational means?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those matters are not confined to Lothian. Mary Hartnoll from Strathclyde says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Extensive use has been made in schools of drama with three production companies being engaged in HIV-related productions with follow up workshops."</p></blockquote>
Strathclyde has done excellent work, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always believed that music is not peripheral, but central to the curriculum. Lothian's policy is to provide a service that will allow people the opportunity to learn to play a musical instrument without having to pay for tuition, and to play together in bands and orchestras whose players are drawn from a wide area. That highly integrated service is staffed by specialist instructors, who provide tuition in primary, secondary and special schools across our region. Besides tuition, instruments, music
	<span class='label label-info column'>1062</span>
and transport to rehearsals are also provided. The region benefits from concerts of the highest quality, which have attracted sponsorship from the most prestigious companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lothian has 135 instructors; resources of £2.5 million per annum; availability of instruments, can cost up to £6,000 and a high degree of co-ordination to make specialist tuition available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Specialist ensembles are drawn from the whole region. A "Fanfare for Europe" concert was given in the Usher hall in December 1992, and a "Fanfare for Lothian" concert in November 1993. Features also include free provision of instruments to pupils, free tuition, tours abroad to Canada and Denmark, and repeated championship successes in United Kingdom and European competitions. I know at first hand about the advantages of those facilities, my family having benefited from them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will Lothian's outstanding musical success be sustained by smaller authorities? Would a small authority have the resources for highly specialist tuition? Will the new councils be able to afford expensive percussion, brass and wind instruments? Will provision inevitably be reduced to bread-and-butter tuition directed at popular instruments? Will parents in small authority areas be prepared to pay for tuition if necessary, and will it be necessary to pool resources under joint arrangements?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some, if not all, Committee members received communications from the Musicians Union. I talked to Dennis Scard, its general secretary, and to Ian Smith, its new Scottish organiser. Their letter states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We do not wish to see in Scotland what has already happened in England/Wales where in November 1992 a UK Council for Music Education and Training survey showed that centrally funded music services amongst the Local Education Authorities had dropped from 92 per cent. to 37 per cent. in five years. By September 1993, this figure was 25 per cent. Devolved or 'privatised' music services have struggled to survive with few exceptions and the break up of the ILEA has had a disastrous effect on the provisions of instrumental teaching in London."</p></blockquote>
I could discuss the subject in much greater detail in the light of the experience of Mrs. Reid, who came from the Inner London education authority to be director of education in Lothian, but I shall spare the Committee that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have two further questions. Will the Government ensure that the requirements illustrated by previous experience of the breaking up of large education authorities in Britain are properly funded? When ILEA was dissolved, the number of posts with salaries of £20,000 or more increased by 238, or 67 per cent. Those figures come from 	<i>Public Money and Management</i> of spring 1991. Such an increase in senior posts and other aspects of administration, particularly at the inception of a new authority, would inevitably affect cost effectiveness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of even greater import is the possible impact on service delivery, stemming from increases in the costs of administering the education service—such as had been documented—regardless of any general increase in administration costs, estimated as part of the price to be paid for the Bill's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leads to my final question. In the face of the experience of the successor London boroughs to the Inner London education authority, how will the Minister ensure that there will be no reduction in specialist education
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0589">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1063</span>
services in terms of for example, class sizes, or the closure of small schools, to pay for increased administration costs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we began consideration of the Bill, we established that there would be no new money. That will have to come from somewhere and I fear that in the upheaval, specialist education will, in part, have to pay the price</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause is largely about what the Minister termed cross-boundary pupils. In the debate earlier today, he said that he saw no reason for local authorities to change catchment areas, to align primary schools inside their boundaries with secondary schools. I can see several reasons for local authorities not only choosing but having to change catchment areas to align primary and secondary schools. One relates to the funding of pupils who cross boundaries to attend a school in another council area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the twenty-first sitting of the Committee, the Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The grant-aided expenditure assessments for school education are predominantly based on pupil numbers by attendance rather than on their home addresses. They therefore take account of the authority directly incurring the expenditure"—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 8 March 1994; 	<i>c.</i> 973]</p></blockquote>
I understand that to mean that children living in the Dundee area who cross the boundary to Monifieth high school in the Angus council area will cost Angus council money. As a result, Angus council's grant-aided expenditure will be increased to enable it to meet the cost of Dundee pupils who attend schools in its area. The Dundee authority's grant-aided expenditure will be decreased because pupils no longer attend schools in its area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Immediately, there is a reason why the new Dundee authority might find it necessary to realign the catchment areas of its primary schools to ensure that they are within the catchment areas of Dundee schools rather than those of schools outwith the area. Whoever controls the Dundee area might change the catchment areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman could be right that the Dundee authority might make judgments and decisions. Does he think that those judgments and decisions might be influenced by the decline in Dundee's population and the growth of the population in the rural areas around Dundee? Such changes are bound to have an impact.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are bound to have an impact on the amount of money that the council will be able to spend on education within its boundaries, which is another good reason for changing some primary school catchment areas around Broughty Ferry which currently fall within the catchment area for Monifieth high school. That school will be outwith Dundee's control. There may be an attempt to bring primary feeder schools within the catchment area of Grove academy, which remains in Dundee. It may be insisted that the children in the area attend Grove academy rather than Monifieth high. The Minister has not addressed that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hundreds of children are in that position, so a considerable sum of money will be lost to the new council in Dundee as a result of the proposed boundary changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Dundee authority might change school catchment areas because Dundee has 12 other secondary schools
	<span class='label label-info column'>1064</span>
within its boundary. The decline in population and revenue base will mean that the new smaller authority will find it difficult to keep the 12 schools open.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the twenty-first sitting, I quoted the Secretary of State for Education on half-empty schools in England and Wales. I shall repeat the quote. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If there are two schools within two miles of each other, and there are many surplus places, there should probably be only one school. We want top-quality schools, not half-empty schools such as those kept by Labour education authorities".—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 8 March 1994; 	<i>c.</i>989.]</p></blockquote>
In the course of our debates the Minister has said that he does not rule out rationalisations of school places. There will be pressure on the new council to close some schools in the Dundee area. It is inconceivable that a Labour or a Scottish National party authority faced with school closures will simultaneously help to fund pupils from its area who are going into another area's schools. That will not happen. There will be pressure on the new council to realign the catchment areas of its primary schools to ensure that they fall within the Dundee area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Three of the 12 secondary schools in Dundee are Catholic. We were given a lot of nonsense this morning about the reassurances that had been given to the Catholic population in Scotland that Catholic education would not suffer in any way as a result of the boundary changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am telling the Minister that it will be difficult to keep open three Catholic schools in the Dundee area if the new Dundee authority area is small. The authority will not have the revenue base to keep the schools open. It will be forced to introduce closures as a direct result of the boundary changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not the only person who is making those arguments. The Catholics who live in the Dundee area recognise that. I have letters from Bishop Logan of Dunkeld, from the school board of Lawside academy, which my children attend, and from the board of St. Joseph's primary school in Dundee expressing concern about the future of Catholic education as a result of the changes introduced by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The financial pressure on the new authorities will be enormous. The grant-aided expenditure and the revenue support grant that is allocated to the new education authorities is based on the consultation document issued many years ago by the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), now the Minister of State, Department of Employment. That contains a pupil-teacher ratio that is considerably below the pupil-teacher ratio currently provided by Tayside education authority. I think that Tayside spends £5 million in excess of what the Government gives to it in revenue support grant for the pupil-teacher ratio.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new authority will not be able to sustain that expenditure above the revenue support grant that it receives from the Government and so will be forced to make savings, which implies that there will be fewer teachers and fewer schools for the people in Dundee. For that reason, there is pressure to change the school boundary areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister claimed that the transitional costs will be funded wholly by the Government in the move to the new single-tier authorities. However, his estimate of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0590">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1065</span>
transitional costs is well below everyone else's estimates. The transitional costs are likely to be three times what the Minister will give as grants to the authorities. That money must come from somewhere and so it will come from the money for the services that the new authorities will provide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all those reasons I do not accept the Government's assertion that the existing pattern of education provision in Dundee and Tayside will not be affected. I think that the Bill will result in enormous problems and that that experience will be repeated throughout Scotland because of the boundary changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the subject of provision for children with special needs, I must say that I had experience as a councillor in Tayside of working with families in Dundee and outside to make provision for visually handicapped children, for blind children. Special provision has been set up in a school in Dundee which used specialist equipment and brought in specialist teachers to ensure that the children could stay in their locality and not have to move away from their homes in Tayside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tayside regional council resisted such special provision for a long time and gave way eventually only after pressure from parents. It resisted because of the costs involved and because of the numbers that were needed to justify the provision. Those numbers had to come not just from Dundee, but from all over Tayside before the costs could be justified. The changes proposed by the Bill put at risk such provision because there will no longer be joint arrangements between Dundee, Perth and Kinross and Angus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister knows that Perth and Kinross is already in secret negotiations to make joint arrangements with Stirling and will come out of any arrangement with Dundee. There is no guarantee that Dundee and Angus will agree about continuing such joint arrangements. Those councils may be very different in their political colouring and may find it impossible to agree on priorities and on how money should be spent within their education budgets. The likelihood is that Dundee will be left on its own with specialist provision in one of its schools which it cannot really afford and cannot justify in terms of numbers because the children from Angus and from Perth and Kinross are going elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not good enough for the Minister to say that authorities have a specific duty under the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 to make adequate provision for such children. They always had that duty, but they did not have to have specialist provision, such as that in Dundee. Children with visual impairment could be sent from Dundee to the Royal Blind School in Edinburgh. Therefore, children had to leave their families and live in residential homes during the week and could return home only at weekends. Authorities were meeting their duties under the 1980 Act when they arranged that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be cheaper for the new single-tier authorities to meet their duties under the 1980 Act by continuing to send children to the Royal Blind School in Edinburgh, which the Minister, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton), has visited. He should visit the provision in Dundee which is put at risk as a direct result of the changes in the Bill. If the Minister does not understand that, he is not fit to be sitting where he is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1066</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the final exchange on the biggest local authority service. We have had a day and a half discussing various education issues during which the Minister has repeatedly had the opportunity to ease the anxieties of many people working in the system and of parents by explaining clearly how he expects the new system to operate. I regret that he either chose not to do that or was unwilling to do so. He provided virtually no answers to our many serious points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the benefit of a classical education, the Minister at least reads well. He read out his brief well, except when one of the pages seemed to be in the wrong order. However, that brief did not contain much and did not answer our questions. I presume that as many of those questions were complex you will write to us in due course. I asked particular questions about specific locations and particular circumstances, but you referred to only two out of my six questions. You mentioned briefly the position in Argyll in relation to St. Joseph's, but did not answer all my questions, and you referred to St. Ninian's in passing. We deserve to receive full responses and I hope that the Minister will undertake to give written answers to those questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposals will result in different policies being applied to Roman Catholic schools and to non-denominational schools. As I said earlier, I understand that you brought forward the new proposals as a logical extension of the existing provision. However, when the catchment areas cross boundaries, Catholic schools will be dealt with differently from the non-denominational schools in exactly the same position when neither school reaches the 80 per cent. rule. You must be aware—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I know that the hon. Gentleman is referring to the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The Minister must be aware that the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of Scotland have said clearly and publicly on many recent occasions that they want both sets of schools to be dealt with in the same way. However, that will not happen under the Bill. We are entitled to a clear and categorical answer from the Minister on how he squares that circle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also want the Minister to clarify whether the Government accept the Eastwood principle, to which I referred this morning, as one of the criteria for determining signifiant deterioration. That principle is that children in Eastwood should be educated in Eastwood and should get priority over youngsters from other authorities. If the logic of that policy is carried over to other geographical areas, it has clear implications for provision in those areas. The Minister must tell us whether he accepts the position of his fellow Minister, the hon. Minister for Eastwood, or whether Government policy will be determined on a fair and impartial basis, depending on need in a particular location rather than on an arbitrarily drawn boundary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister completely ignored the question of who makes the final decision when consultation crosses boundaries. We all understood that there was to be joint discussion and consultation, but the Minister did not spell out which authority would make the final decision in those circumstances. As we discussed this morning, the decision of one authority could have substantial knock-on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0591">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1067</span>
financial and educational effects for another authority. It is not clear whether the Minister will make that final determination. If so, he will have final responsibility for virtually every school closure in Scotland which I should have thought that he would not welcome, although as a former education chair, I should be happy for him to have that responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The complexity is considerable. A reorganisation of Catholic education in the south side of Glasgow, for example, could include four authorities. In those circumstances, the problems of co-ordination are considerable. The Minister must spell out how those problems are to be resolved. Otherwise, there will be a great temptation for authorities to choose to make rationalisations that are restricted to their own boundaries, rather than going across boundaries. Those cross-boundary rationalisations may be more necessary but their greater complexity will meaan that there will be pressure to avoid them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I want to ask the Minister what is understood by the term "significant deterioration", which might stand as part of the clause. I went to the source of almost all wisdom, the Library, for a definition. The reply that I got stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"You asked what the phrase 'significant deterioration' means … staff in the Oriel Room of the Library were unable to find any reference to such a phrase in other legislation … colleagues have checked the Annotated Current Law statutes and judicial dictionaries but have not found the definition of the phrase."</p></blockquote>
I said that the Library was not the source of all wisdom. Library staff resorted to the Scottish Office, where they thought that they might find the answer. They told me in their reply that "they understood from an official in the Scottish Office that" phrase appeared in a Government circular, but that
	<br><blockquote><p>"it does not explain how it should be interpreted. The official said that this will depend on the circumstances of each case."</p></blockquote>
That is a wonderful example of how to tell someone nothing at all but be pleasant about doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is the Minister. We are entitled to a clear explanation of what the Minister believes the phrase "significant deterioration" means in these circumstances. What factors are to be taken into account—cost, capital cost or revenue costs? Is it a question of distance, or of curriculum balance, or of the size of the school? I believe that all those factors should be taken into account, but authorities will have no idea of the nature of the Minister's reserve powers or of how he intends to interpret them. The feeling today has been that those powers exist only to preserve the existence of separate Catholic primary and secondary schools and that the criterion of "significant deterioration" would be the only one to be applied. However, the matter is not so clear now. The Minister must spell out how he intends to use the powers that he will insist on taking by forcing through the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the past few sittings, the Government have revealed an unwillingness to accept that the reorganisation of local government will have a severely deleterious effect on services in general and on education in particular. There is an assumption that we will simply muddle through in some way, that everything will be all right on the night and that something will turn up.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1068</span>
However, costs will greatly overrun the amount of money that the Government are prepared to allocate to reorganisation. Those overruns will come out of services. So in addition to the dislocation and disruption that will occur, there will have to be cuts in services at a time when those services need more money spent on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will give the Committee better answers to those questions than he has given so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have the opportunity to respond. The hon. Member for Linlithgow asked about HIV and music. I can tell him that we shall issue guidance to the new authorities on a whole range of matters. We have already issued guidance to education authorities on HIV and AIDS. It will be up to education authorities to decide how to target those matters. Our guidance will cover a range of subjects including the arts, sport, music and libraries. The questions raised by the hon. Gentleman relate not only to the Scottish Education Department but to the social work services group and the Scottish Home and Health Department. I shall consider the detailed points that the hon. Gentleman raised and discuss them with my colleagues. I was slightly surprised that the hon. Gentleman did not also raise the question of drugs education, which relates to HIV and AIDS and for which a task force has been established.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Lothian police organised two major conferences on drugs, one in Linlithgow and the other at Edinburgh Fettes. I attended the Linlithgow conference and I was absolutely taken aback. Although those of us who attended had a fairly good idea of the extent of the problem, we had our eyes opened even further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some £40 million is being spent on that problem across a range of services in Scotland. I shall consider carefully the points made by the hon. Member for Linlithgow and reply to him in writing in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to special educational needs, I must make it clear that if a child is in a special educational needs school, the funding goes to where the child lives, and if a child is in a mainstream school, it goes to where the child is educated. The funds must follow the child, and in the event of difficulty, the Secretary of State has powers to arbitrate and to enforce the duties, as I mentioned earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Govan was anxious for me to give a further definition of "significant deterioration". I do not want to be unhelpful, but the meaning of deterioration in the context of provision, distribution and availability of school education inevitably must depend on the circumstances of each case. It is not possible for me to make a judgment in advance on individual cases. Clearly, in reaching his view the Secretary of State would take account of all the relevant factors, especially the advice of Her Majesty's inspectorate. I shall consider the points that the hon. Gentleman raised. He said that I had not answered one or two of them. I shall read 	<i>Hansard</i> carefully and reply to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Govan raised the issue of Eastwood. Before any change in St. Ninian's catchment area could take place, there would have to be full scale consultations. We have not come to any view on that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0592">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1069</span>
because inevitably the Secretary of State would have to consider the results of consultation in a school that is more than 80 per cent. full. There are other possibilities: if only a small number of extra pupils are required to be accommodated at the school, the case for additional capital expenditure on further building would have to be considered. It is inappropriate for the hon. Member to suggest that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has formed a view in advance. He cannot do that, because he has to have before him all the facts and circumstances. I pay tribute to the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), who is an outstanding Member of Parliament for his constituency, which is why his majority increased enormously at the last election. We recognise that he is an exceptional Member of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The correct rules and procedures will be followed scrupulously in all cases. Before there can be any change in any catchment area, the authority has to consult fully all interested parties and thereafter, under the 80 per cent. rule, the case has to be referred to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Govan asked what will happen if schools are not 80 per cent. full. As now, the authority concerned will have the jurisdiction. In his case, he had the jurisdiction to decide whether a school should be closed because of the need for rationalisation. I do not envisage a change in that procedure. The hon. Gentleman also asked me whether I thought that the powers that he exercised as chairman of an education committee should be taken away and given to the Secretary of State. The answer to that is no. I think that that practice should continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister deal with the warning given by the hon. Member for Dundee, East that if the money follows the pupil, the education authority might question why it should send money outside its borders when it has spare educational capacity within them? What would happen if Dundee did not wish to send pupils to Monifieth high school, but the parents of Barnhill, whose children enjoyed a superb education at Monifieth high school, wished them to continue to attend? The Minister has created this situation. Who would decide if the education authority in Dundee wished to fill the spare capacity in Dundee, yet the parents in Barnhill wanted their children to continue to enjoy an education in Angus?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The simple answer is that the duties are in statute and they have to be carried out. The authority cannot default on those duties, and if it tries to do so, the Secretary of State has powers to ensure that they are carried out.

The clause also protects the interests of brothers and sisters by providing that any arrangements giving them priority for admission to schools must not discriminate against siblings in the area of another education authority.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is probably appropriate that I should nudge the Committee gently into the more tranquil waters and less contentious areas of clause 33 and schedule 4. The education clauses were, rightly, contentious, and have been argued with some passion. I hope that the Minister will concede that this is a significant group of amendments, which cover an important part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Coming from my part of the political spectrum, I try and spend as much time as I can attaching importance to the other person's point of view. The trouble in this Committee is that it is difficult finding other views from the Government to which to attach importance. I hope that the Minister will give us an idea of what the Government have in mind and how their thinking has developed since the publication of the consultation document and the White Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me say at the outset that I defer to the greater experience and knowledge of the hon. Member for Fife,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0593">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1071</span>
Central, who is a technical expert on these matters. I fear that the Committee's weekend might be late rather in starting early because, knowing what the hon. Member for Fife, Central can do with a marginal, restricted brief, goodness knows what he will make of these amendments. I look forward to having a short debate, however, and trying to find out further details of what the Government have in mind for the planning processes, especially structure plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said before, I am prepared to support the Government's general thrust in terms of establishing unitary authorities and having slightly smaller authorities. However, I am concerned at the possibility of fragmentation of the coherence of the planning structure, especially in relation to structure plans that we have enjoyed in Scotland since the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are three groups of amendments to clause 33, all dealing with separate issues. In addition to the amendments before us, the group led by amendment No. 348 deals with the prospect of structure plans as they will affect parts of unitary authority areas, while the group led by amendment No. 349 argues the case for joint boards, as opposed to joint committees. I think that the Committee would be well advised to spend more time debating the final group of amendments than the first two groups. However, we would value the Government's views on the first two groups of amendments to the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 335 would leave out "may" and insert "shall"—not blindingly original, perhaps, but very significant in terms of structure planning north of the border. It is worth spending a moment considering why we should have structure planning at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear from what the Government have said in the consultation document and the White Paper that structure planning is required so that decisions of an over-arching and strategic nature or of more regional significance can be assessed within a strategic framework, and so that exclusively local views and ideas alone do not always prevail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By its very nature, structure planning means that difficult decisions need to be taken about particular land use which cannot and should not be taken at a purely local level. Of its essence it is a function of local government that deals with cross-boundary issues, which are becoming more significant to our constitutents. There are difficult planning decisions to be taken and choices to be made not just about housing and industrial developments but about large-scale mass incinerators, theme parks, tourism developments and so on. Those issues are on such a scale that they cannot be countenanced in an entirely local context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Strategic planning has an important role in protecting local communities against wider external development changes which could threaten their future well being.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.30 pm</p>
	<p>[MR. MICHAEL J. MARTIN 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>In many ways, the debate is about subsidiarity, about decisions being taken at the most appropriate level: the lowest level consistent with sensible administration.</p>
	<p>Structure plan areas must therefore be drawn in a manner that ensures that communities of interest,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1072</span>
travel-to-work patterns and other such matters are taken into account. I am not persuaded that the boundaries as they are currently drawn match the socio-economic geography of some of the areas of Scotland for which we are legislating for local government. For example, Helensburgh and Argyll have difficult issues to resolve in making proper provision because of the differences between the two areas. Milngavie and Bishopbriggs have far less association with each other than both have individually with the city of Glasgow.</p>
	<p>The Bill splits land use and transportation. That has a natural consequence which could lead to a situation in which there is no individual agency which can co-ordinate strategic land-use planning and transportation. The Committee must consider that issue. Transport as a function is split into three separate functions—indeed, in the Clydeside conurbation it could be said to be split into four. Public transport, road building and traffic management would be difficult to cope with in a co-ordinated way and an integrated system of transport will be that much more difficult to achieve than it is under the current structure.</p>
	<p>The Stoddart committee considered the issue of structure planning and local planning in 1980. Its report stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Scotland cannot be divided into water-tight regions … However it is possible to identify areas within which there is a high level of inter-relation in matters such as housing, transport, shopping and employment, areas throughout which any major planning decisions are likely to have some effect and which through geography and patterns of settlement seem to form natural units".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>The committee found a high correlation of community of interest between certain areas. The Stoddart committee said that such areas need some form of strategic regional planning. Annex 2 to the Stoddart committee report published in 1990 stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"While it might be argued that smaller planning units could combine to prepare a strategic plan for their region it would be difficult to gather sufficient unity of view and purpose to make such a plan effective."</p></blockquote>
It continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Some authority is needed to set and maintain the overall framework for the area and to deal with individual applications which involve the interests of more than one of the smaller units within it."</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>Stoddart was right to take that view. It is true that the Government recognised that to some extent in the White Paper and the preceding consultation process. The amendments are intended to clarify some of the issues and take the matter further forward.</p>
	<p>A view is held among the environmental pressure groups that if structure planning as it it now exists were to be seriously compromised it would be harder to work towards the Government's environmental objectives for sustainable development, given the lack of co-ordination or strategic view. Speaking as someone from an area with a lot of forestry I consider the matter particularly important for the development of forestry strategies all over the country.</p>
	<p>What worries me more than anything else is that the Government's present approach to the issue could lead to conflicts of interest between councillors and officers, whom it is not right to put in that position. We should recognise the work that has been done by the bigger planning authorities—the strategic regional authorities, which have been in operation since 1973. An example is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0594">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1073</span>
Strathclyde's Greening the Conurbation strategy, which has produced some excellent results. That issue is not even mentioned anywhere in the Bill. The excellent regional parks that have been such a signal success recently should also be mentioned. Many other specialist planning services, such as archaeology, are growing in importance. The Government have a duty to make proper provision for such services in the Bill.</p>
	<p>Amendment No. 335 would place a duty on the Secretary of State, whereas the Bill as it stands is permissive. Clause 33 will import a new section after section 4 of the Town and Country Planning Act (Scotland) 1972, making it permissible for the Secretary of State to designate areas by order.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Atkinson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman reads what will, if the clause is passed, become section 4A(2) of the 1972 Act, he will note that it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The district of every planning authority in Scotland shall be included in a structure plan area."</p></blockquote>
The subsection would require every area to be included in a structure plan area. I should have thought that the Secretary of State would therefore be compelled to allow for that. The amendment is redundant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Only if a structure plan exists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The subsection states that each district "shall" be included.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know, but subsection (1) would take precedence over subsection (2). The hon. Gentleman made a good try. If he stays with this question he may arrive in the end. Some issues which, to be fair to the hon. Gentleman, I shall discuss later in the debate with reference to other amendments, give rise to concern among professional associations and bodies dealing with planning in Scotland that the Government's plans are too uncertain. Amendment No. 335 is intended to deal with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 347, which is almost the same in intent as amendment No. 377, tabled by the hon. Member for Fife, Central, would determine a date by which areas should be designated. Now that I have seen amendment No. 377 I prefer it to mine, because it would allow more time for the shadow authority to see the definition of the joint structure plan areas to be published by the Secretary of State. Amendment No. 336 would subject the order to the affirmative rather than the negative procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has an opportunity to explain further the Government's intentions with regard to definitions of areas. Their definition is so important to the strategic planning of structure plans that the duty in amendment No. 335 should be imposed. The areas should be defined within a time scale that would enable a smooth transition and transfer of the service to the new joint bodies or joint committee. That will guarantee the continuity of the new service from 1 April 1996.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local plans will be adopted and implemented by each new unitary authority. There is no difficulty about that. However, the local plans will need to be consistent with the structure plan that lays down broader policies for the wider area. We need to know what is in the Government's mind for the provisions that will be made for joint planning arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1074</span>
The Government gave a hint of what they had in mind in the document on local government which they published in July 1993. It does not tell us much. There are four or five sentences about transport, but they constitute a casual approach to that subject. Transportation policy and an integrated policy are necessary, particularly in view of the environmental pressures of which we are aware. Page 8 of the document states casually:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Those few services which require co-ordination between adjacent authorities can readily be arranged through joint co-operation."</p></blockquote>
That is fine as far as it goes, but where is the flesh on the bones of this clause? There is not much to take us forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document devotes three paragraphs to planning, but they are superficial, optimistic and, in some cases, positively opaque. The document states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As at present, local plans will need to be consistent with a structure plan laying down broad policies for a wider area."</p></blockquote>
That is fine as far as it goes. It is a necessary condition to make the structure framework right. However, the next paragraph adds that the Secretary of State
	<br><blockquote><p>"will expect the authorities in those areas to work together to prepare and maintain such structure plans."</p></blockquote>
That is optimistic and more a triumph of hope over expectation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 3.20 covers cases when the Secretary of State
	<br><blockquote><p>"considers that inadequate progress is being made".</p></blockquote>
I do not know what that means and I would like a definition of "inadequate progress". However, if he thinks that that such progress is being made the Secretary of State
	<br><blockquote><p>"might, if he considers it necessary, use his powers to take over the preparation, alteration, repeal or replacement of a plan himself."</p></blockquote>
There is residual enabling power for the Secretary of State to step in to clarify the position. The Government were right to include that provision, but it is not clear from clause 33 and schedule 4 when that provision will apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not clear and I have not seen any evidence about what the Government have in mind for the membership of joint committees or joint boards. I assume that each unitary authority that takes part in a joint committee or joint board will, by definition, have at least one representative on the committee or board. That point extends further than planning. On any joint committee or board, I assume that there will be at least one representative from each unitary authority area. It is inconceivable and unconscionable that one could have joint committees and boards that did not have proper representation from all the areas that they cover, even though I appreciate the need to keep them as small as possible so that they are efficient and can take executive decisions effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put it to the Government that under the consultation process professional bodies and local authorities remain uncertain as to what is in the Government's mind about the detail of the joint structure plan areas. The amendments give the Government a chance to tell the Committee what they have in mind. Their thinking must have developed a bit since July 1993. I am aware that civil servants hate putting dates into Bills or in primary legislation. I understand why that is so. The amendments
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0595">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1075</span>
are probing ones and I shall withdraw them, if the Minister gives us some assurances about the dates by which the areas will be known and gives us some idea about the structure plan areas that he has in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We understand that the four principal cities will inevitably need some type of joint working arrangements. However, the Clyde valley area is an example of one in which schedule 1 has changed the structure of the new authorities. That may have led to some reconsideration by the Government. If the Committee is to consider clause 33 and schedule 4 sensibly, it needs more information from the Minister about what he has in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) for his comments about my expertise. It is a bit rusty. I spent five years studying the subject, but that was a long time ago. Funnily enough, my first job was in the social work department of Edinburgh corporation where I did research into social work. My degree was of little use initially, but it helped me to secure a job with Dunfermline district council. I should not say that I worked for that council, but I was employed by it for 13 years so that I could be involved with Fife regional council as a councillor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire has set the tone for the debate. This should not be a contentious issue. Despite the word "planning", which could be an anathema in a political discussion with Conservative Members, Scotland has had a huge success in the post-war period in relation to strategic planning for the United Kingdom and Scotland, particularly for the west of Scotland where some of the work has been excellent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause deals with strategic planning, land-use planning, transportation planning and structure planning. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire raised some of the key issues, which will unfold over the debate on the amendments. I do not intend to be long on some issues because amendment No. 349 on joint committees and the statutory framework is the issue upon which most concern has been expressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not talking in abstract terms about a planning concept. As the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire pointed out, the issue is about the quality of the environment and the quality of life. I hope that we can consider the process in two ways. First, we should examine the transition period that the reorganisation will create. That period will be uncertain. Secondly, we must look beyond the implementation of the reorganisation, if it gooes ahead, at what will happen to the interface between the structure planning process and local plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no dispute about the issue of local plans. They will be concentrated in the new unitary councils, but they are an important element in local plan preparation—an issue of more concern to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first group of amendments concentrates on the permissive nature of the provision. The argument revolves around the words "may" and "shall". It is important in planning to have statutory guidance for all concerned. It is less than helpful of the Government to suggest that, in a new unitary structure, it can be left to local authorities to decide whether they join or participate in joint committees, or voluntary boards. The provision should be stronger, because a great deal depends on
	<span class='label label-info column'>1076</span>
it—including commercial investment decisions, the quality of transportation and the environment, and the quality of life in the household—not only at the local planning level but at the important level of structure and strategic planning. It is vital to get this right. Government Members will say, "That is the Opposition. They want statutory requirements to force people to do things, and organisations to be prescribed in a heavy-handed way." That is not so. The self-evident common sense of our proposals should attract the Government's support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a danger that some new unitary authorities will think that they can steal an advantage over other authorities by having, a more flexible approach to planning issues. By tightening the whole process, and having a local plan framework in statute, and a structure plan framework that is not permissive, we shall ensure that the planning system will unfold, with all the issues that I mentioned being accommodated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have dealt with the use of "may" and "shall". We are also considering areas for structure planning. The Bill is a little misleading about what constitutes a structure plan area. Strathclyde and Lothian have an excellent system of cohesion in local planning, structure planning and the umbrella strategic planning. Of course tensions arise, for example, in Fife, which has three districts and is something of a self-contained unit. Tensions will always arise on issues that affect planning, because many aspects are involved and people will have differences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present a statutory framework exists whereby each authority in Strathclyde, and the regional council, knows what is happening. That is a sensible way forward. It would not involve the Government making concessions on the politics of their philosophy. It would mean that through the transition period and beyond, there would be a simple set of statutory rules that would allow every sector, including the private sector, to know where it stood. That would mean good planning all round.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have highlighted briefly some concerns that we shall pick up later. Our amendments may, as the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire said, be probing ones, but I believe that they have substance. When the Minister responds, I hope that he will take on board if not their precise nature, the spirit in which the Opposition have moved them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish that my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central had gone on for another five minutes. I fear that my speech will be interrupted by the adjournment for dinner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been clear throughout our debates that the effect of the Bill would be extremely disruptive. We have had a series of debates on education, exploring the impact of the fragmentation of local authority services on the crucial education service in Scotland, and now we are discussing planning. It is abundantly clear to me, and to my hon. Friends that the proposals could wreck everything that has been achieved by the present extremely high quality strategic planning structure in our cities; conurbations and rural areas in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments were designed to make the best of a bad job. They would require the Government to designate areas for structure plans and to establish joint boards to fulfil the function. The Committee has discussed joint boards previously. Labour Members do not like joint boards; they are an inherently unsatisfactory way of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0596">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

The Committee keeps returning to the fact, that there is a requirement for local administration and for a strategic overview of a range of local services. The idea was developed by the Wheatley commission and has worked well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government say that they want to cut through that and establish small, single-tier authorities, but an examination of practically every clause of the Bill establishes that that is not how things will work. There is still the need for an overview and an intermediary authority between the Scottish Office and the local councils. The Committee is compelled to get round that by going for the second-best, botched job of establishing joint boards. That will be the case for planning as it is for everything else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The value of what has been achieved by structure planning as provided by the regions cannot be overstated. Structure planning is particularly valuable to the major conurbations. Schedule 1 of the Bill will mean that Glasgow, and to a lesser extent Edinburgh, will be surrounded by several small and poorly resourced new authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Edinburgh will be surrounded by West Lothian, East Lothian and Midlothian, the Borders and, across the Forth, Fife, which is a bigger authority. Glasgow will be surrounded by no fewer than eight small, peripheral authorities, nine if North Ayrshire is included. How on earth Eastwood can produce a structure plan beats me. Obviously it cannot.

It is worth referring to what the Government said in the consultation document on the structure of local government in Scotland, "Shaping the New Councils". They stated in paragraph 19.15:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The greater the number of authorities involved in joint working the more cumbersome the coordination becomes. It is also likely that there would be conflict between individual authorities' interests and the collective interest."</p></blockquote>
That is self-evident; we are trying to provide for it in the course of the debate.

Members of the Committee can envisage circumstances in which a small new council might be persuaded to accept a major development proposal despite the fact that it might breach a structure plan. There is an example of such conflict in my constituency. The Minister will be familiar with the case because he lives in the area.

Archerfield is a fine, but derelict building of great architectural importance. It should be redeveloped, preserved and turned into a public asset. A developer came along and proposed that Archerfield be developed as a hotel with a golf course. As usual, part of the package was consent to a housing development—500 houses to generate the money that was required to pay for the development of the building.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The district council understandably thought that it was worth paying the price. It was prepared to give consent to the 500 houses. No one was keen on the houses being built because the site was not appropriate to the development of what was effectively a large village. Lothian regional council called in the proposal because it was a breach of the structure plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to note that because Lothian was able to take a grip of the situation, 25 houses, not 500, is the price of the development.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
