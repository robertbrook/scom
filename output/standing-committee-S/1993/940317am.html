	<time>Thursday 17 March 1994</time>
	<p>	<i>(Morning)</i></p>
	<p>[MR. MICHAEL J. MARTIN 	<i>in the Chair]</i></p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Local Government etc. (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. On Tuesday night—admittedly late at night, which perhaps explains it—the Minister, the Member for Edinburgh West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton), said, on a number of occasions and I quote from one of them:
	<br><q><p>"The Bill does not make any specific arrangements for staffing of local roads authorities."—	<i>[Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 15 March 1994; c. 1213.]</p></q>
He went on to say that there would be no effect on staffing in St. Andrews house, yet, under under the heading, 	<i>Effect of the Bill on Public Service Manpower,</i> the Financial Memorandum states:
	<br><q><p>	<i>"Clause 38 and Part IV</i> will result in a further small reduction in local authority staffing levels and a commensurate small increase in the numbers employed by The Scottish Office."</p></q>
In the light of that, would the Minister like to correct what he said late on Tuesday night, otherwise the Committee will have been given misinformation? It is very important that what he said is corrected, and that he explains exactly what the position will be on public service manpower.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a matter for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) should not be carrying on a discussion with a member of the public. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I do not care who they are—they should not be having a discussion at the end of the Room.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Martin. I accept your ruling, as I always do. It would be helpful if the Minister were given an opportunity—perhaps on a point of order—to correct the misinformation that he has given to the Committee. It would be unfortunate if that misinformation were left on the record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I say again to the hon. Gentleman that that is not a matter for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. I suggest that we could raise and discuss the issue during the clause 42 stand part debate, if that would be acceptable to you.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1222</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Members of the Committee received a letter yesterday from the Scottish National party in Kilsyth, saying that the views of the SNP had been misrepresented in the Committee and that the Kilsyth SNP totally disagrees with the Cumbernauld SNP former provost about what should happen to the boundaries. Could we go back to discuss that section of the Bill to allow the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh), who represents the SNP on the Committee, to change his view and come into line with the SNP in Kilsyth?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whatever the hon. Gentleman said must have been in order. The views of any political party about what is said in Committee are nothing to do with me. It is up to the hon. Member for Angus, East to decide what to say in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>ESTABLISHMENT ETC. OF STRATHCLYDE PASSENGER
<br><br><!-- lb --> TRANSPORT AUTHORITY</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 248, in page 38, line 16, leave out from "Authority," to end of line 20 and insert—
	<br><q><p>"() Section 9 of this Act shall apply to any person transferred to the Authority under this section as if any reference in that section to a new authority included a reference to the Authority.".</p></q>
The amendment clarifies the transfer of functions, staff, property, rights, liabilities and obligations from Strathclyde regional council as the current passenger transport authority to the new Strathclyde passenger transport authority as from 1 April 1996.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 40(2) provides that the functions, staff, property, rights, liabilities and obligations of the existing PTA will transfer to the new PTA on 1 April 1996, but it goes on to provide that the order-making powers of the Secretary of State in chapters 2 and 3 would also apply to the transfer insofar as it dealt with staff, property, rights, liabilities and obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that automatic transfer and vesting is the most straightforward way of dealing with the transfer of functions, staff, property, rights, liabilities and obligations between the two authorities, and it is therefore considered that the references to chapters 2 and 3, which are deleted by this amendment, are unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clearly right that any staff who might be transferred to the new authority should not be disadvantaged in any way. The amendment makes it clear that they will retain continuity of employment by the application to them of the provisions in clause 9. The amendment clarifies and simplifies the transfer between the two authorities and makes suitable provision for any staff who might go to the new authority. I therefore commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is a reformed character this morning and the Opposition welcome that. He has announced that he intends to safeguard the rights of staff who are transferred from employment by Strathclyde regional council to the PTA. We welcome that, but why are there safeguards for staff who are transferred to the PTA when there are no such safeguards for highways staff, whose situation we debated on Tuesday evening? There will be no safeguards
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0679">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1223</span>
for the people who will have to be forcibly transferred from the local authority to the Scottish Office, or perhaps made redundant. Why is there that contrast in the treatment of different groups of local authority staff?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I explained the situation in relation to roads exactly the other night. With the detrunking and trunking of more roads, there will have to be full consultation with the local authorities concerned and we must have a clear idea of what consultancy arrangements can be used. If it is appropriate, Mr. Martin, I can answer the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) in detail but, as I have suggested, it might be better to deal with the matter in the clause 42 stand part debate. I shall accept your guidance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said before, we must keep to the amendments before us. Perhaps it is a good idea to raise the matter during debate on clause 42.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, Mr. Martin, this amendment is about staff rights. Hitherto, with the exception of the roads people, there has been complete consistency. There have been proper safeguards to protect the employment rights of staff who are transferred or to pay them appropriate compensation if they are made redundant. One group of people, however, are slipping through the net. I welcome the fact that the Minister has tabled this amendment—this forfeit—but what about the people who have been missed out? Will the Minister please make the Bill consistent so that all staff have equal rights?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the best way forward is to deal with the subject in the clause 42 stand part debate, which will happen soon. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that the transfer of functions relating to staff is provided for by the Bill. The amendment clarifies that and should be of considerable assistance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 443, in page 38, line 21, after "may", insert 	<br><q><p>"after consulting the relevant local authorities.".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 445, in page 38, line 34, after "may", insert
	<br><q><p>"after consulting with the relevant local authorities.".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments would require consultation with all the relevant local authorities about participation in the new PTA in Strathclyde and about its boundaries. Is it the Government's intention that the Strathclyde PTA should have the same boundaries as the present PTE, or will it be contracted or expanded? What do the Government have in mind about consultation and the boundaries?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 443 would place on the Secretary of State the duty to consult the relevant local authorities before making an order to set the boundaries of the area for the new PTA and its constitution and membership. Amendment No. 445
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1224</span>
would place on the Secretary of State the duty to consult the relevant local authority where it is proposed that the boundary of the authority should be varied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the Government's intention to consult relevant local authorities before making a decision on the boundaries of the new authority area. We see considerable merit in discussing fully with those bodies the implications of such boundary changes. However, we see equal merit in consulting more widely on the issue with other interested parties—for example, the PTE—and other bodies representing relevant interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We consider that it would be invidious to single out one particular group of bodies for consultation, as the amendments would effectively require, particularly where an assurance has been given to consult relevant bodies, including local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same argument holds good where it is proposed that the boundaries should be varied. When consideration is being given to altering the boundaries of the authority's area, I assure hon. Members that the relevant local authorities will be consulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consultation on the constitution of the membership of the authority is clearly a matter in which the relevant local authorities have a close interest. I am happy to confirm that we shall consult the authorities on that issue. I hope that hon. Members will accept that such consultation will take place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not too happy with that reply. I am happy to accept the undertaking on consultation, but we sought through the amendments to give the Government the opportunity to say what area they think the Strathclyde PTA should cover. Should the PTA cover the same area as the current PTE, or should the area be smaller, or larger?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our intention is that the area should not be smaller. We want to consult about the matter, as the population can change. During the past 20 years, for example, Glasgow's population has decreased, while the populations of other areas have increased. Such factors have to be taken into account in the consultation that I have undertaken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is probably most appropriate for consultation to take place shortly after 1 April 1995 with the new shadow authorities. The hon. Gentleman suggested that they would not have any staff. They will have a limited number of staff and that will be the most appropriate time to take the matter forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has given his opinion about the PTA and its future boundaries. Will he now say what the Government's policy is about the future of the PTA in Strathclyde? As the Minister said, the PTE covers only a part of the Strathclyde region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall discuss concessionary fares later, but what would happen if the PTA's area were not extended, but the PTA obtained powers to provide concessionary travel for residents in its area? What then would happen to concessionary travel in Strathclyde outwith the PTA's area?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scale and size of the PTA are important. We accept what the Minister said about consultation—that was the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0680">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1225</span>
main aim of the amendments—but it would be useful if the Government were to tell us what their policy is for the future of the FT A, especially as there will be a large number of single-tier councils, which may or may not wish to be part of the PTA. What powers will the Government retain to ensure that we have a sensible, coherent, efficient and effective passenger transport structure in the west of Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallic 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to record my pleasure at the Minister's comments about consultation on the PTA area. That is important to my constituents. The rail network currently extends as far as Ayr, just as it does to Helensburgh, which is in another constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that Strathclyde regional council has extended its PTE area on a 12-mile adjacent area basis. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will examine that in his consultations, and that he will have regard to it when the responses come in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) implied that his constituents enjoy the benefits of the PTA at the moment. Will the Minister confirm that I am right in thinking that the PTA does not stretch to Ayrshire?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot tell the hon. Gentleman exactly where the future boundaries will lie. Existing boundaries will be maintained, and I am happy to furnish him with a map of them. I cannot confirm now that they do not extend to Ayr.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr is relevant and will be borne in mind during consultation. I cannot say what the boundaries will be in future, but we do not intend to reduce them. The question is whether they should be extended to provide, for example, greater reassurance on the future of supported rail services, which are of great importance and benefit to Strathclyde.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) touched on concessionary fares. We shall debate them later, but I can, perhaps, answer him briefly. I am aware that concern has been expressed on the issue, and the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) brought a deputation to discuss it with me. We have responded by tabling an amendment which will be considered when the Committee reaches schedule 13.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Strathclyde Elderly Forum has asked me to thank the Minister for the courteous and helpful way in which he dealt with its representations at our meeting. The amendment that he has tabled is a step forward. We shall discuss it in more detail later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is vital that concessions that are to be made in the current Strathclyde PTA area are extended to the whole Strathclyde region. For once, I agree with the hon. Member—I nearly said my hon. Friend for Ayr. It would be intolerable if the concessions covered only the existing Strathclyde transport authority area. They must cover all of Strathclyde.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister told us on Tuesday that he would begin consultation during the next few months. I am certain that elderly groups, community groups and all sorts of organisations from all over Ayrshire will insist that the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1226</span>
PTA extends the benefit of concessionary travel to Ayrshire and other parts of Strathclyde. I hope that the Minister will indicate that he expects the PTA area to expand to include Ayrshire, and not to contract</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a remarkable event when the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley and my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr agree. Travel concession schemes can be extended to places in the vicinity of PTA boundaries. Local authorities in Scotland can make concessionary travel schemes for specially defined categories. Our proposals will leave that unchanged. New councils inside and outside the new Strathclyde PTA will have powers to promote schemes, as local authorities do now. The amendment would enable the new PTA also to exercise that power, thus providing maximum flexibility for the provision of concessionary travel schemes. The PTA and individual authorities will be able to co-operate in providing travel concession arrangements across local authority boundaries. I see no reason why satisfactory schemes should not continue to be provided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not dwell on concessionary travel, as the next group of amendments deals with the subject. It is crucial that we concentrate briefly on the future boundaries of the Strathclyde PTA. All members of the Committee are aware of the huge benefits that the PTE provides. To try to avoid confusion in future, any consultation should take place against the background of a Government who are firmly committed to an integrated transport network in the west of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We may have consultations about the extension of the powers and boundaries of the PTA, but that may have an impact that we would not like on some authorities. The new single-tier councils will inevitably be transport authorities, so we want the Government to be firm in their support of the PTA and in their commitment to a policy of extending it and ensuring that there is not a free-for-all in transport and planning in the west of Scotland—because at the moment there are 12 transport authorities pursuing individual policies while Strathclyde is responsible for concessionary travel arrangements which may not continue in every area if the PTA has only part of the power. Rail, and other forms of public transport must also be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a powerful case for the Government not just to give an opinion but to develop over the next few months a coherent view that applauds what the PTA has done and ensures that it is continued and extended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are keen to avoid any disasters during the next two or three years, and I hope that the Government will accept that. The Minister will reassure everyone if he says that there is a firm commitment to ensure, through consultation, that the PTA's enormous success is not diluted—indeed, that it is extended to every part of Strathclyde.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the hon. Member for Fife, Central. I should like to record my appreciation of the networking facilities of the PTA, but I believe that in certain areas some diminution of its involvement would be welcome. I want to make it clear that I do not support everything that the hon. Member for Fife, Central said, although I agree that networking, particularly in rail, should be extended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0681">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1227</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his remarks. I can do no more than return to the terms of the amendments: as I said, they are too restrictive in their present form, but I could consider a less restrictive amendment on Report so that the matter can be taken forward effectively. I think that that would meet the wishes of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a helpful debate. I am a little worried by the possible implications of the reservations expressed by the hon. Member for Ayr. Consultation is all very well, but there is a risk that the failure of some people to participate in the ongoing work of the PTE could wreck it completely. It is important to proceed with the greatest possible consent and support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The nightmare scenario would be if one of the new small authorities—East Renfrewshire, for example—were to decide that because its citizens were going around in Jaguars and had no need to worry about buses and trains, it should opt out of the PTA. That would severely damage its future operation.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to speak principally about the new clause 4, which would make it possible to establish passenger transport authorities in other parts of Scotland besides Strathclyde. I welcome the fact that clauses 40 and 41
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0682">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1229</span>
and schedule 5 will ensure the continued existence and operation of the Strathclyde passenger transport executive. I cannot resist commenting that that is yet another example of the Government's having to reinvent Strathclyde. It has happened with strategic planning, the police and fire services and with a whole list of joint boards. All the legislation started life in an idiotic, infantile speech at the Tory party conference, in which Strathclyde was described as a monstrosity. Here we are reinventing it, beause it is not a monstrosity, but does a useful job and people need it; "Oh yes"—to use the catch phrase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The passenger transport authority is, emphatically, valuable and necessary to people in Strathclyde. If the PTA system is good enough for the Clydeside conurbation, it is good enough for other major concentrations of population in Scotland. It is worth emphasising the value of the PTE to people in the Strathclyde area. A brief summary of its work shows that its annual budget of about £91 million is clearly valuable to that area. Since its inception in 1975, the PTE has invested more than £430 million, at current price levels, in public transport in Strathclyde, opening 42 new stations. Strathclyde subsidises rail travel by 50 per cent., halving fares for thousands of people. For example, the Helensburgh to Charing Cross day return fare is £4.50. Without a subsidy it would be £9. A monthly rail ticket from Cumbernauld to Glasgow costs £52.30, but without subsidy it would cost £104.60. The general subsidy of 50 per cent, amounts to £30 million a year in Strathclyde.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More than 400,000 concessionary travel cards are issued to elderly and disabled people, providing them with subsidised travel across the region. Last year that service cost £17.98 million or £39.70 per card holder. It is estimated that the benefit for each card holder is about £60. The much admired dial-a-bus scheme costs only £800,000 a year and is available to 95 per cent, of disabled people in Strathclyde. Friends can go shopping and move around the region whenever they choose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Strathclyde subsidises its bus services within the region. Without them many communities, particular rural ones in the more distant parts of Strathclyde, would be completely isolated for all or part of the day. Strathclyde's rail network is the largest in the UK outside London. It has 171 stations and carries 35 million passengers each year. School transport is provided to 52,000 pupils at 599 schools across the region. Strathclyde passenger transport executive provides 3,400 mostly free park-and-ride spaces throughout the network.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth putting on the record that summary of the extremely extensive and valuable work of the Strathclyde passenger transport executive. The PTE can do all that because it is able to plan integrated services throughout the area. It has the advantages of economies of scale and, as a PTE, under section 56 of the Transport Act 1968 it has access to special funding for the development and operation of passenger transport services throughout its area. Those services are the envy of other parts of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Strathclyde has opened 42 new railway stations in co-operation with Scotrail since 1975. It has made major investment in trains to serve the needs of the area. The PTE now owns 120 electrical multiple units and 25 diesel
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1230</span>
multiple units, purchased for the people of Strathclyde with the aid of special Government subsidies available for the PTE. It also works to co-ordinate and develop bus services. That co-ordinated provision of good public transport, convenient timetables and reasonable fares has achieved an increase in the use of public transport in Strathclyde which is truly remarkable as public transport use has been squeezed in most other areas since bus services were deregulated in 1986. That trend in Strathclyde is extremely good news as it is helping to contain the growth of private car traffic in the region. As my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central said, the concessionary travel scheme for pensioners and disabled people means that Strathclyde's elderly people are some of the most mobile pensioners in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a lobby yesterday by members of the Strathclyde Elderly Forum. They came down to express their concern about what could happen to the concessionary travel scheme in their region. In their submission they said:
	<br><q><p>"Concessionary travel is a lifeline for older people allowing them to shop, use health and community care services, play an active part in their communities and maintain social contacts. Without an adequate concessionary fares scheme many older people will become isolated in their own homes.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>Strathclyde Regional Council currently operates the most extensive concessionary travel scheme in Scotland, costing £17.98 million a year, allowing pensioners to travel for just 25p per journey. It is vital that this service is not lost during this reorganisation.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>We wish the Bill amended to include a statutory obligation on the new Passenger Transport Authority to operate a concessionary travel scheme."</p></q>
The Minister has said that he will move an amendment later. We welcome the concession that he announced following a meeting yesterday with the Strathclyde Elderly Forum and my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley. I congratulate all concerned on that achievement and I am delighted that that high quality concessionary travel scheme should be able to continue in Strathclyde.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But why should Strathclyde be the only part of Scotland to have the benefit of the structure and funding of the passenger transport executive? Why should Strathclyde be the only part of Scotland to have these safeguards for the vital concessionary travel scheme? The contrast between the quality of public transport in Strathclyde and in other parts of Scotland is clear enough now. The Bill could worsen the situation considerably in a number of other regions, most particular in Lothian which is the one that I obviously know best.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lothian has not had the benefit of a PTE. Indeed, it is the largest conurbation in Britain, other than London, that does not have a formal PTE at present. It has not had access to section 56 funding but in spite of that Lothian regional council has been able to make considerable achievements. In my constituency, Lothian region and Scotrail have opened a station at Musselburgh and are constructing a station as Wallyford; they have electrified the north Berwick branch railway line; they have helped to provide parking areas at stations in the district for the benefit of commuters and other travellers going to and from Edinburgh. Lothian region's regional perspective has led to the development of rail services through Edinburgh from east Lothian to Livingston and Bathgate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The region also promotes a good network of bus services. We have the advantage of a good concessionary
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0683">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1231</span>
fares system across the region. There is a 30p flat-rate for all journeys by rail or by bus. In Lothian, 135,000 passes have been issued to pensioners and disabled people and 33 million trips are made during an average year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Age Concern has written to the Minister appealing for similar safeguards for the concessionary fares system as it applies in Lothian, in line with the concessions and undertaking that he has been prepared to give to Strathclyde. I hope that he will make a positive response. As a Lothian Member of Parliament, he should be anxious about the needs of his constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are serious grounds for fearing that pensioners and disabled people in East Lothian and other parts of Lothian region could lose the benefit of the current scheme as a result of the Bill. This month, our pensioners will be hammered by VAT on fuel. Next year, they could be deprived of their mobility by the break-up of the concessionary travel scheme. That is possible, because the three smaller councils in Lothian will find it difficult to reconstruct a regional cross-subsidy scheme. For example, the average cost of a concessionary bus journey within the city of Edinburgh district is 56p. The fare charged to people who qualify for the concession is 30p. There is a subsidy of 26p per journey for pensioners. For pensioners in my constituency in East Lothian, in Midlothian and in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) in West Lothian, the average cost of their longer concessionary journeys—greater distances have to be travelled by those who live in outlying areas—is 80p.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The flat-rate fare of 30p applies across the region, so the subsidy for people in outlying areas is 50p a journey, in contrast to 26p a journey for those in the city of Edinburgh. Such a cross subsidy is possible in a regional council that serves the whole area, but I doubt that the new Edinburgh city council will be prepared to underwrite the extra costs of the scheme in East Lothian, Midlothian and West Lothian.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a risk that the scheme will be broken up and that pensioners in East Lothian will not be able to use concessionary passes for journeys to Edinburgh and that the fares for the journeys that they can undertake will be greater. That will be a serious blow to many elderly people in my constituency and in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow. They will be left more isolated than they are now, which would be deplorable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is vital that the travel concessions be safeguarded. One of the best ways of doing that would be to provide for the establishment of a PTA to cover Lothian at least, and perhaps a wider area. A PTA would be able to make further improvements for bus services and, most importantly, it would be able to achieve more investment in better rail services. There could be more stations and better timetables, which would help to take commuters off the roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am acutely conscious of the situation in my constituency, where Lothian is able to subsidise rail services on the north Berwick branch line and the communities served by it. However, at the other end of my constituency, the Dunbar area is served only by InterCity trains. The timetable provides for few stops which is not convenient for commuters and adds to traffic on the A1. If there was a Passenger Transport Executive,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1232</span>
it would be possible to subsidise rail services to Dunbar, which would divert traffic off the roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A PTE for the area around Edinburgh could improve transport services on both sides of the Firth of Forth; better rail services, better trains and more stations in Lothian and in Fife could and should reduce the volume of road traffic throughout the area. It would improve the environment in the city, and should kill off the idea of a second Forth road bridge, which would be wasteful and unnecessary if there were proper transport planning in the area. All in all, the new clause could do a great deal to safeguard existing services and avoid further aggravation of road traffic in and around Edinburgh and in other parts of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is hopelessly confused, with an ever-increasing mixture of supposedly single-tier councils and a proliferation of joint boards. This part of the Bill will create an intolerable degree of discrimination by providing special arrangements for Strathclyde which could not be implemented in other parts of Scotland. That discrimination could have a vicious impact on pensioners in constituencies such as mine, as well as having an adverse effect on road traffic and other transport issues. The new clause would make the same advantages available in every part of Scotland. On that basis, I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should say at the outset that the new Strathclyde PTA will have powers to borrow and spend money, and it is therefore appropriate that it be subject also to relevant controls and checks in relation to the exercise of such powers. At present, the Bill applies the accounting and auditing provisions in section 96 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. Amendment No. 249 will, therefore, apply other similar provisions which might be regarded as flowing naturally from the basic accounting and audit requirements in section 96. Thus, for example, by virtue of these amendments, the PTA will be subject to examination of the Commission for Local Authority Accounts in Scotland. These are sensible extensions of the basic accounting controls currently contained in the Bill, and I commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be grateful if the Minister would speak more slowly. He is speaking far too quickly for hon. Members to follow these very important points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members have not spoken to their amendment (a), but I shall be happy to accept it. I shall explain why shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 251 and 252 will insert a reference to the new PTA in section 23 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1975. This will mean that the new PTA will be subject to the jurisdiction of the local authority ombudsman who will be able to investigate complaints of maladministration in accordance with his powers under the 1975 Act. I am sure that members of the Committee will agree that this is an appropriate measure, and I commend the amendment to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment (a) would place on the new PTA the duty currently placed on local authorities to make proper arrangements for their financial administration, and to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0684">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1233</span>
ensure that the proper officer of an authority has the responsibility for those arrangements. It is, therefore, a general provision which complements the detailed provisions of accounts and audit which it is proposed should apply to the PTA. I do not see such a provision as being, in itself, of great significance, but in placing a duty of sound financial administration on the PTA, the Government subscribes wholeheartedly to its terms. I am happy to support its inclusion in this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened very carefully to the arguments in support of new clause 4, which seeks a power for the Secretary of State, on application by two or more authorities, to establish a PTA. We believe that the PTA in Strathclyde has worked extremely well. Our desire is to continue with the arrangement whereby the PTA and the Strathclyde PTE are responsible for public transport matters in the transport area centred around Glasgow. It has been a successful arrangement, and we wish to ensure that it continues in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Outside the Glasgow conurbation, our view is that the new councils will be fully capable of co-ordinating their transport requirements without the need for statutory joint arrangements. It may be helpful to remind honourable members that local authorities outside a passenger transport area exercise similar powers to those exercised by PTAs. That is a very important point. The ability of local authorities to function effectively in relation to public transport requirements will be undiminished by their lying outwith a statutory PTA arrangement. I should stress that where it would prove useful for adjacent authorities to co-operate on public transport matters, they will of course be free to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some members of the Committee may want me to define the special nature of the public transport needs of the existing designated area in Strathclyde to which I referred. The scale of the permanent infrastructure and its uniqueness in Scotland justify the use of the term "special" to describe Strathclyde's public transport needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to return to the general point about discrimination in view of the fact that the Edinburgh conurbation is the biggest in Britain without a PTA.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond to that technical point before I sit down.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall in a moment if the hon. Gentleman is patient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no need in our view for a PTA structure in Lothian because a co-operative solution between the parties is capable of progressing work on the various transport measures envisaged. We see no reason why those measures cannot be carried forward, where
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1234</span>
appropriate, by the new authorities. Lothian region is an excellent example of co-operation on a considerable scale. A package of transport measures such as roads, park-and-ride facilities, bus ways and enhancement to rail services, including new stations, parking faculties and a second road bridge, is being considered by Fife and Lothian regional councils, the Forth bridge joint board and the Scottish office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister asked me to be patient. I and some of my hon. Friends are impatient because if the Bill had been thought through, the Minister would not have to turn round to ask Mr. Hetherington for a note. The Minister would be able to answer such fundamental questions immediately. Again, it has been revealed that Ministers do not understand their own Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the hon. Gentleman was about to ask a question of substance about Lothian.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities outside the PTA area exercise similar powers. However, the funding of rail services is different in the PTA area where support for rail is provided by the PTA rather than directly by the Government as in other areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
PTEs do not figure in the clause, but it is not possible to consider PTAs and PTEs separately. The PTA is responsible for broad policy matters in respect of public transport provision and, crucially, the funding of the PTE. The PTE, with its separate statutory existence, is responsible for the day-to-day execution of functions, such as the support of railway services and socially necessary bus services across the conurbation. The partnership between the PTA and the PTE constitutes an appropriate public transport structure. Nowhere is there a case of a PTA existing without a PTE.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are no conurbations comparable in size outside the Glasgow area, and none would justify the imposition of a PTA/PTE structure. The new councils, which will inherit public transport functions, will be able to work jointly on a voluntary basis and will prove equal to then-task.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendment No. 491 enables the new Strathclyde passenger transport authority to promote travel concession schemes for its area. The powers of the constituent councils within the PTA to make schemes will remain and those arrangements, which are parallelled in PTA areas in England and Wales, will ensure that authorities have maximum flexibility to respond to local and conurbation wide requirements.

The amendment will enable concessionary fares to be made available in future. It makes clear the desirability to continue and promote travel concession schemes. As I mentioned earlier, a day ago I met a deputation with the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley. I am happy to commend amendment No. 491, which ensures that the new PTA will have the necessary powers to deal with this important subject in its area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Davidson) will be interested to know that amendment No. 449 would do the same thing, so he will welcome the fact that we have covered already what we believe to be an essential point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (1) of new clause 39 would enable Strathclyde passenger transport executive to act as an agent of any local authority in Scotland in securing the provision of public passenger transport services. The PTE exists to secure such services within the Strathclyde passenger transport area, and in accordance with policies defined by the PTA. Those arrangements, whereby there are separate powers and duties of PTAs and PTEs, are designed to meet the transport needs of specific large urban areas. It would not make sense for the PTE to act on behalf of local authorities outside the PTA area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, the proposed provision could lead ultimately to the creation of an all-Scotland PTE, which is unnecessary and unjustifiable. We believe that outside the PTA area the new authorities will be fully capable of meeting their own local transport needs, where necessary in co-operation with one another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The extensions to the PTE's powers proposed in subsections (2) and (3) are unnecessary. The Local Authorities (Goods and Services) Act 1970 contains an order—making power that could be used for the purpose envisaged by subsection (2) of this new clause, namely to designate the PTE as a public body for the purposes of the Act. With regard to subsection (3), the PTE already has substantial powers in the Transport Act 1968 to do things required for the purpose of its business, including constructing and repairing anything required for that purpose. The power could no doubt be used in respect of bus shelters and queue barriers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a straightforward question. I am puzzled by the Minister's reasoning. If he is saying that Strathclyde works for transportation and for fire and police services, why is he abolishing it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that it is his party's policy to have one tier of local government. It then makes little sense to have a region that covers two fifths of the Scottish population. I do not imagine that even his party would
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1236</span>
introduce a proposal along those fines. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Gentleman has clearly not been listening to our debates. We want local government to be much more responsive to local democracy and we believe that that will be the effect of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend amendments Nos. 249, 251 and 252 and amendment No. 491 on concessionary fares. I invite my hon. Friends to support Opposition amendment (a) to amendment No. 249, if the Opposition press it. In the light of what I have said I hope that they will not press their other amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given that the Minister is such an honourable Member and a generous man, it is a pity that we have to launch an attack on the clause. The implications of the comments on the amendments and on the Government's future transport policy in Scotland are disastrous. Of course the west of Scotland needs an integrated transport policy, yet the Minister says that the PTA boundaries will remain and that there will be a commitment to consult the new single-tier units on whether they wish to participate in relation to policies, services or boundaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government do not take seriously the effective functioning of the west of Scotland as an economic and social unit. When we try to obtain some idea of what they want for the rest of Scotland, all we get from them is praise for Strathclyde and for Lothian. We have heard complete and utter drivel from the Minister. That is an appropriate word because if we used anything more sophisticated, it would endow the Minister's contribution with more than it deserved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are we really to believe that after introducing a major reorganisation of local government, the Government will turn back the clock for public transportation and for concessionary travel? I fear for the whole process. We have argued for the Strathclyde PTA to be extended to the whole of Strathclyde. Every regional policy and planning decision since the war has accepted that the west coast of Scotland—the Clyde—is a unit that can be planned for and can provide effective and co-ordinated strategic and transportation planning. All of a sudden, because of the Government's hatred of the word planning, that is to be asset stripped and the PTA is to continue, but not be extended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen outwith the PTA when Strathclyde disappears? The Government said that each single-tier authority will have transport powers for a concessionary scheme. I should not like to be a pensioner living in an area of Strathclyde that is outwith the PTA. I fear that 12 individual decisions could be taken, which would torpedo some of the best concessionary travel schemes anywhere in Europe. That is the price that people will have to pay for the absurdity of this reorganisation and the Government's ideas for the future of the public transport authority in Strathclyde.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments also deal with what will happen outwith Strathclyde. It is nonsense to say that Lothian and its constituent authorities—however many they are—will get together. That is policy on a wing and a prayer. Travel and business depends on a proper and effective transportation system. Hundreds of thousands of people in Lothian currently benefit from some of the best available provision, yet all that could be lost suddenly because of this crazy half-baked Bill. Does the Minister
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0686">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1237</span>
never accept serious comments about the Bill? What is he offering to Lothian if it is dismembered into its constituent parts? Is he saying merely, "Let's get together, folks. Let's have some voluntary co-operation. Let's forget Lothian's excellent concessionary travel scheme and leave it up to the three or four authorities involved"? Those are dangerous and reckless policy perspectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Government to take away much of the nonsense that we have heard this morning and the nonsense in the Bill and start to get to grips with some of the serious issues that this flawed Bill introduces. The Minister talked about Lothian and Fife in relation to the new road bridge that may be built with private sector funding Under the new system will the West Lothian single-tier authority pick up the bill for the accompanying roads to the new road bridge? Lothian will not exist. Will the people of West Lothian foot the bill entirely for their part of the crossing? Meddling with effective and successful regional councils forces small single-tier councils to pick up a much larger bill than in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does that issue not cry out for some coherent transport planning in Lothian? Why will not the Minister accept that where two authorities wish to come together they can have a statutory PTA? Why will not the Minister accept that we cannot carry on with this wing and a prayer approach to real issues? We need statutory arrangements. As my hon. Friends have pointed out, no matter where one starts in debating crazy clauses one always ends up with a two-tier system. That is what we get every time. The Government have no answer. Ministers bow their heads and get on with their letters. They simply have no answer, the Bill started off as a single-tier Bill yet as every clause unfolds we find that we have actually got a two-tier Bill. Because of the Government's obsessive prejudice against areas like Strathclyde and Lothian they will not accept that</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is worse than that. It is a discriminatory two-tier system. They are providing for two-tier transport planning and administration in Strathclyde for very good reasons, but by resisting new clause 4 which would make it possible to establish PTEs in other parts of Scotland they are ensuring that that sort of co-ordination cannot be achieved in other parts of Scotland. That is discriminatory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right If the door had been left open to that possibility that would have been one thing. This reckless abandonment of good practice means that local authorities in the new set-up will have no possibility of getting together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to speak briefly about concessionary travel. This is the big political issue for pensioners in Scotland. At present our regional councils provide excellent schemes. My authority in Fife will be spared the axe, although the Government still intend to steal Kincardine and Kincardine pensioners will be dismayed to lose their concessionary scheme. Fife provides free travel for 55,000 older people and those with special needs. It is an excellent service. Because Fife will not be dismembered the scheme will, I hope, carry on with a sane and sensible council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen in Lothian? What will happen in the parts of Strathclyde outwith the PTA? Let us remember
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1238</span>
that on the vesting day those efficient and effective transport councils will just disappear. I want the Minister to tell every pensioner in Scotland today that every public transport service they enjoy, whether bus or rail, will be totally safeguarded under this reorganisation. There should be no ifs or buts and no equivocations. We must have a statement from the Minister today that every existing service will be maintained and there will be no reduction in the quality of life enjoyed as a result of the public transport services provided by the current councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that the Fife concessionary scheme is a cross-boundary scheme? People can travel freely by train or road into Lothian and back again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to extol the virtues of Fife. Not only do we have transport to the major cities through the integrated services provided but many people enjoy 20 free journeys to the cities in Scotland as a result of the British Rail agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason that I am stressing—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I served in the Labour minority administration which took over Tayside regional council in 1986. We found that we could never match the Fife scheme because we inherited the legacy of 11 years of Tory control. As a result our concessionary travel scheme could not match that of Fife, which had a Labour administration from the inception of regional councils in 1975.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is again inviting me to be immodest. I accept the challenge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fife's geography, uniqueness and enduring ability to return Labour administrations means that it has one of the best schemes, but why should Fife pensioners and disabled people enjoy such a service when pensioners' services will be put at risk in the new set-up because local government is being butchered?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister cannot run away from the Committee without telling more than 1 million Scottish pensioners that their services will be safe in Tory hands after the reorganistion. We do not want the drivel that we heard earlier. The Minister should give guarantees to every pensioner. If he does not we will ensure at the forthcoming elections—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even that pensioner on the Government Front Bench.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister, the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) is not in that age group. My hon. Friend's remark was less than charitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government do not give guarantees this morning, this will be a major issue that will confront the electors in both of the forthcoming elections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The technicalities of the matter are important. Can the Minister say who will provide the concessionary travel scheme if there is not a PTA for, for example, Lothian? Will it be the constituent single-tier authority? Will a voluntary arrangement be arrived at by the four constituent single-tier authorities? Will some parts of Lothian not have a travel scheme? He must confirm
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0687">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1239</span>
whether any of those eventualities will arise and, hopefully, discount the latter option.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fife and other authorities operate other services which are linked to the statutory provision in the Transport Act 1968. In Fife, if an old person, someone with special needs or someone who is severely disabled cannot use public transport, they obtain a free colour television licence. Such services are replicated throughout Scotland. Has the Minister involved himself in the details of such services or are the Government once again joyriding through services, unconcerned as long as they get the Eastwood boundary right? Nothing else matters. The Minister raises his eyebrows and laughs, but he knows that the Bill was built around Eastwood. Anything else was superfluous. He may laugh, but the Committee knows the truth. He is now trying to grimace without a laugh, but that is difficult in this situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must answer my questions. Failure do do so will mean that my hon. Friends and I will attack the Government until we receive the guarantees that are vital to the people we represent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Fife, Central was not sure whether he was immodest. He was particularly ungracious, especially when he referred to Government amendment No. 491. The hon. Gentleman should have joined the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley in complimenting the Minister on his commitment to continue the concessionary scheme in the Strathclyde PTA area. It is unfortunate that that was not recognised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is always generous in giving way. My wider concern is what will happen in the rest of Scotland. It is easy to acknowledge, as the Government have done, that there may be a problem with the PTAs, for which there is a provision in the Bill. However, what will happen outwith the PTA area?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully recognise that problem. I shall make a few brief comments on it when I discuss new clause 39.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has given excellent examples of what may happen in the rest of Scotland. He has mentioned an excellent scheme in Fife, which I know from first-hand and intimate knowledge. A local authority has established that scheme. Other authorities will see the example that Fife has set and will attempt to create such schemes. In many instances, they will be capable of doing that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has demonstrated that it is possible to look outside a local authority area. He has confirmed that the Fife scheme provides for the elderly free transport to Glasgow and Edinburgh. Therefore, the scheme crosses boundaries. My hon. Friend the Minister is offering similar arrangements for the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Kynoch 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the difference between the two sides that the Opposition want to put everything in statute and have little confidence in the new local authorities while Conservative Members believe that local authorities should be given maximum flexibility? I pay tribute to the concessionary scheme that is operating in Grampian region. I am sure that the new local authorities will carry such schemes forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1240</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. He used the word "flexibility" and that represents the impact and import of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Flexibility is important and the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch) validate the argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right to welcome the fact that the services will be safeguarded in his constituency as well as Strathclyde. However, I am concerned about the Minister's and my own constituents, who will not have access to such arrangements. Subsection (1) of new clause 4 states:
	<br><q><p>"The Secretary of State may, on an application in that regard by two or more local authorities, by order establish a passenger transport authority".</p></q>
The word is "may", not "shall". New clause 4 would enable local authorities to get together to establish a PTA should they want to do so. What is wrong with that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister suggested that the new clauses should be withdrawn. That would give him the opportunity to re-examine the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 4 and, especially, new clause 39 are very restrictive. They would set conditions that I would not wish to sign for. Therefore, I am relieved that the Minister has agreed not to accept those new clauses albeit by suggesting that they should be withdrawn. Perhaps they contain suggestions that the Minister could consider in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have expressed my reservations about some of the areas in which the PTAs are involved. The hon. Member for Fife, Central has said that the Bill contains crazy clauses. New clause 39 could certainly be described as crazy. The powers that it will give to the passenger transport executive will already exist in the new local authorities. That would lead to the doubling of responsibilities and powers of influence. That is unwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman be absolutely clear about what he means? He prefaced his remarks with an attempt to persuade us that he believes in concessionary fares. Those remarks were repeated by his hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside. Does the hon. Gentleman mean, by his use of the word "flexibility", the flexibility of local authorities not to run concessionary fare schemes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My remarks could certainly be interpreted in that way, but only a stupid local authority would turn

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1241</span>
its back on the opportunity to provide its citizens with benefits from the use of the time when bus and train services are underused. It is logical to use that time to provide people with good facilities, as happens now. The issues would become the issue of the day at the local elections. Any local administration that proposed to abandon such policies would have a hard task to persuade the electorate that it was the right group to run the local authority area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no difficulty with the concept, which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside suggested, means devolution down to the level of the local authorities, to allow them to determine their own policies. It will be up to them to provide services that match the interests of the people whom they represent. I have every confidence that any Conservative authority would aim at that very objective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will give way finally to the hon. Member for Fife, Central.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has been generous again. He has been talking about political composition, but I want to leave that question aside now and discuss the scale of authorities. What kind of integrated approach to transportation and to concessionary fare schemes can be provided by authorities the size of Kyle and Carrick or Stirling—and Eastwood, too, of course? Stirling will have 70,000 to 80,000 people. What kind of service will it be able to provide for older people in the area and for those with special needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The services that would be provided in such circumstances as now exist would involve co-operation and consultation with neighbouring authorities and involvement with the area's service providers to meet the population's needs. I have already suggested that with regard to rail services I should like the PTA for my constituents to extend its involvement, into Ayr. As to other matters for which passenger transport executives are now responsible, I should not agree with their interfering in, let us say, the provision of bus shelters within the local authority area. Such minor issues should be the responsibility of the local authority. That arrangement is on offer now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman's speech. Do I in any way distort it by saying that his argument is that in some areas the regions must be reinvented, to borrow the expression used by my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian? The facts make such co-operation necessary. I have one precise question, to which I do not know the answer. What, under the clause, would be the financial responsibilities of the new, comparatively small, proposed West Lothian authority, for the infrastructure associated with the south end of the proposed second new Forth road bridge?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What we have heard from the Minister this morning proves yet again that the Government are offering a multi-tier local government system. This is not a simplified unitary authority system but, as is becoming apparent from our consideration of the Bill, a complex, multi-tier, multi-structure system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1242</span>
The Minister said in defence of his policy with regard to Strathclyde PTA that the difference in scale justifies the continuance of Strathclyde PTA. I understood him to say that Glasgow would dominate and the other authorities would be too small, so there should be a Strathclyde PTA. A similar situation exists in all the city regions throughout Scotland. City regions were at the heart of the previous Wheatley reform. If the Minister's logic applies to Strathclyde, surely it therefore applies to all the other regions in Scotland, because of the way that they were constructed. Why is that logic—if, indeed, there is logic behind this policy—not being applied?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that there is a need for national co-ordination of transportation supplied on a local basis. That is not provided in the Government's proposals. Lip service is always paid to the idea of an integrated transportation system, but nothing is done nationally. The point about Strathclyde PTA is that it co-ordinates and integrates transportation for half the Scottish population. The Government are content to leave Strathclyde PTA intact, but they are also content to do nothing similar elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can transportation systems be linked and co-ordinated nationally and on a local basis? That is the key. How can harmonisation be achieved across local authority boundaries in relation to concessionary travel schemes, for example? As different levels will be in operation, the use of such schemes will be restricted. Will the Minister guarantee the maintenance of existing concessionary travel schemes after reorganisation takes place?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scotland has an aging, but fit, population, who are well able to benefit from concessionary schemes, which utilise off-peak capacity. Taxi systems, dial-a-bus schemes and access to public transport for handicapped persons offer a whole new lease of life to a section of the population that I hope will be allowed to take advantage of valuable new experiences and opportunities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why do dial-a-bus schemes have to be provided by the PTEs? Such schemes have very strong links with social work, community care and health services. Why cannot such schemes be handled at local level?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious to ensure that those schemes are enhanced and improved on a co-ordinated basis. There is a danger of fragmentation and lack of harmonisation across the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The schemes are excellent because they offer a section of the population new opportunities, and we must enhance them. I am looking for guarantees from the Minister that such schemes will continue to operate and that the system will not be fragmented. I should like to see a national system that interlaces and links opportunities across the country. The problem is that different concessionary schemes apply in different parts of the country. I recommend to the Minister the scheme that operates in Grampian. It provides a 10p maximum fare on all bus transportation, 20 per cent, help for rail fares and help for handicapped people. That is a SNP scheme run in co-operation with the Labour party. It is an example of inter-party co-operation. I invite the Conservative party to co-operate in such measures to help those people to whom I have referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concessionary fares are good for passengers, local economies and the providers of transport. After the

reorganisation, the problem will be to co-ordinate and harmonise, the schemes to provide the maximum benefit How will the Government ensure that that is done? How will they achieve the maximum availability for concessionary fares to be used across local authority boundaries? I believe that there should be a national scheme along those lines, but, unfortunately, that is not what the Government have in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I seek reassurance from the Minister about the integration of transport policies and the maintenance and improvement of concessionary travel schemes throughout Scotland. He is introducing a multi-tier system of government. How will he ensure availability and uniformity of provision throughout Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must say to my hon. Friend the Minister that it is essential to keep discretion at local level and as near to the people as possible. I do not subscribe to the view that it is necessary to have monolithic authorities to provide individuals or goups of people with the necessary facilities to move about. All the evidence of public transport shows that, if the pricing structure is light, people will use the facilities. There is no question about that. I am not ashamed or afraid to say that I think—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. If an hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a matter for that hon. Member to consider for himself. It is not a matter for the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Have no fear, Mr. Martin. I am not ashamed of my contact with Stagecoach; I am rather proud of it. What we have done to help old people and students to travel throughout Scotland and elsewhere is on the record. As I said, I am rather proud of that. When my daughter was a student at Edinburgh, she came home every weekend because Stagecoach fares were lower than the cost of travel, for example, between Dundee and Blairgowrie. That statement of fact can be checked by anyone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[SIR JAMES KILFEDDER 	<i>in the Chair]</i></p>
	<p>The marketplace can provide assistance, although I do not suggest that it is the final solution. Thinking, in terms of national or grand schemes stifles the market and does not allow it to provide a niche. Why should the taxpayer be required to pay for a pensioner like me to use concessionary travel? I can well afford to pay and why should not I pay? We must provide facilities and make them available to people whose circumstances are not as comfortable as mine, for instance. I favour such an approach. A combination of what the marketplace can provide and what local councils—that are near to and care about the people in their areas—can provide is a far better balanced arrangement. It is in the interests of those who want to travel and of the taxpayer. That is why the Government's proposals for flexibility are right</p>

us leave aside bus transport for the moment Will the hon. Gentleman consider flexibility as it may or may not apply to the availability of funding for the development of rail services?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The legislation will provide for the continuation of the Strathclyde passenger transport authority, which has access to special funding from the Department of Transport via the Scottish Office under section 20 of the Transport Act 1968 for developing rail services, buying trains and reopening stations in Strathclyde alone. Why should that be available in Strathclyde when it is not available to the hon. Gentleman's constituents in Tayside or to mine in Lothian?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because the market is being interfered with; that is why—[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] Yes. That is exactly why circumstances arise in which fish is made of one and fowl of another. The plain truth is that if the public purse is used to distort the market that is exactly what it does.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a strange debate, Sir James. Unfortunately, you have missed most of it because you have just recently taken the Chair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) asked why the taxpayer should subsidise pensioners. However, he did not ask why taxpayers should subsidise companies such as Stagecoach. It receives the benefits of the subsidies paid to the operators of the concessionary scheme in Tayside. The hon. Gentleman does not object to that type of subsidy. He objects to ordinary pensioners receiving benefits from the taxpayer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North was careful to say that he objected to the prospect of all pensioners, some of whom could afford to pay for travel, being subsidised by the taxpayer. Does the hon. Gentleman accept that that was what my hon. Friend said and will he stop indulging in the Opposition's usual scaremongering by suggesting that my hon. Friend said something that he did not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I heard the hon. Member for Tayside, North say "pensioners like myself". By implication, he meant any pensioner who was not in receipt of income support. The Tories support subsidies only for those on the absolute minimum income. Once people are above that income, the Tories are not in favour of subsidising them because they believe that people can afford to pay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rubbish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Tories want means testing. If the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside believes in means testing, he should say so outright.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. Earlier, there were difficulties because of the speed at which my hon. Friend the Minister spoke. The hon. Member for Dundee, East is speaking at a far faster rate. Will he go a little slower, so that we can listen carefully to his every word?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will attempt to speak more slowly. The difference between me and the Minister is that I speak naturally at a fast rate, but the Minister was reading quickly from a brief. That is ever more unintelligible. I do not know whether the Minister understood what he was reading, but it did not seem that he did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a strange debate. The Minister was unstinting in his praise of Strathclyde regional council and its passenger transport authority. However, he has supported the abolition of Strathclyde regional council at every stage of the Bill. Things cannot get much stranger than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not suppose that the hon. Member for Ayr would mind being described as an arch unionist and as an arch centraliser. However, he spoke in favour of devolving decision making and power from the centre back to local areas. That will appear as strange to those who read the report of the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is most unjust. I have argued long and hard for devolution, and we have achieved that in many areas. The Bill brings power to people in local areas so that they can control their own affairs. That is one of the main points of the Bill, and it underlines my claim to be an honest devolutionist, unlike some others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman can claim whatever he wants. However, since he became a Member of Parliament, he has persistently argued for retaining real power and decision making in this place, which is hundreds of miles from his constituency. He should be fighting on behalf of his constituency for power to be returned there. The best way for him to do that is to argue for a Scottish Parliament, but I have not heard him so argue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I say, this is a strange debate, and it is even more strange that I, who do not represent a seat in Strathclyde, should argue in favour of that region. I lived in Strathclyde at one time, being born and raised in Glasgow. I left Glasgow in 1971 before Strathclyde region came into existence. Each time I return to Glasgow, I witness the significant differences that the council has made for the people in the area from where I come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members have referred time and again to the dial-a-bus scheme that covers 95 per cent, of the population of Strathclyde region. That is almost half Scotland's population. That scheme was not available before Strathclyde was created. Similarly, the rural day card makes cheaper travel available to people in the rural areas of Strathclyde. That was not available when I lived in the west coast of Scotland. The Strathclyde-supported rail network, including services to Helensburgh, Ayr, Largs and Kilmarnock—the blue trains, as they are known in Glasgow—did not exist when I resided in Glasgow. That is evidence of the great benefits available to ordinary people in Strathclyde by the very existence of Strathclyde regional council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People living in Strathclyde do not want decision making devolved to them when they do not have the finances to take significant decisions. They want a local authority that has the power, the finance and the ability to transform their everyday lives. Strathclyde regional council, and its PTA, is such an authority. The benefits available in Strathclyde should be made available to those who live elsewhere in Scotland. I want the people in Dundee and Tayside to have a concessionary travel
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1246</span>
scheme that is as good as the ones in Strathclyde and in Fife. Unfortunately, although we are heading in that direction, it is not quite as good as that yet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to harp on about flexibility, but does the hon. Gentleman accept that not making something statutory does not prevent it from happening? There is no reason why the new local authority cannot provide concessionary fares, but it should have the flexibility to cope with the arrangements that my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is echoing the Minister's argument. The Minister said that the successor authorities would be fully capable of running concessionary schemes similar to those that operate at present. He argued that the local authorities could come together to implement elsewhere, outside Strathclyde, the PTA structures. Anything is possible. It is possible that the Minister, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) will introduce a Bill to establish a Scottish Parliament, but it is not likely. My argument is that it is not likely that the successor authorities to Tayside regional council will implement the current concessionary scheme that is available to people in Tayside because of the existence of Tayside regional council. That is my great concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Building everything into statute could restrict the councils' achievements. If the hon. Gentleman thought about it, a better scheme might be obtained not by statute, but by giving councils the flexibility to get the best possible arrangements for their areas, which is what the Bill is all about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's suggestion is a pig in a poke, and that is exactly what he wants to sell to the people of Scotland. Conservative Members are asking us to trust and believe in them and that as anything is possible under the new local government structure, people may find themselves with far better concessionary travel schemes than are available at present. The opposite is equally true: people may find themselves with far worse concessionary travel schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It ill becomes Conservative Members to talk about restricting local authorities by putting matters into statute, when they are putting into statute that the Strathclyde PTA cannot even choose its own chairman without the Secretary of State's approval.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So much for devolution, for which the hon. Member for Ayr argued, when the Secretary of State can tell PTAs how to run their affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am particularly concerned about Tayside. The current concessionary travel scheme cost Tayside regional council £3.5 million in 1992–93, the most recent year for which figures are available. That covers pensioners, youngsters between the ages of 14 and 16 and people with disabilities. The successor authorities—Dundee, Angus and Perth and Kinross—have the power to fund a joint scheme on the same basis as that currently operated by Tayside regional council. The Minister must accept that if they choose to do that, each council would have to bear responsibility, jointly and severally, for financing that concessionary travel scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0691">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1247</span>
If the cost of the scheme is broken down in accordance with the population of the three successor authorities, Dundee accounts for £2.5 million of the £3.5 million, Perth and Kinross accounts for £440,000 and Angus accounts for £575,000. It would be inadvisable for Conservative Members to suggest that Perth and Kinross and Angus would be happy to bear responsibility, jointly and severally, for a scheme that, by and large, would spend most of its money in the Dundee area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Conservative Members blithely believe that the successor authorities will accept responsibility for funding which does not provide services to the people in their areas, they are not living in the real world. Such a thing is unlikely to happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I trust that the hon. Gentleman is not suggesting that somehow public transport is not a vital aspect of the large rural constituency that I represent. People have to use public transport to travel from remote villages and glens. I expect that the new local authorities will take that on board when they are making decisions that will affect people living in such areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes my point exactly. The successor authorities will take on board what they have been asked to bear responsibility for. If that responsibility covers people living in another council area, they may not be prepared to help to fund or be responsible for a scheme that does not directly benefit only people living in their areas. Why should they bear responsibility for something that operates, in the main, for the benefit of people in another area?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman should remember that under the Transport Act 1985 all sorts of concessionary schemes can be devised by successor authorities, not just one sort in particular. There could be a scheme offering free travel, such as that in Fife. There could be a scheme offering a percentage reduction in fares, which is more common. Flat fares, based on the issue of tokens, could be offered. A scheme could cover a whole day or particular times. Authorities have a menu of concessionary travel schemes that they could implement in their areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who are eligible for a concession under the 1985 Act come from many groups, such as pensioners, those under 16, students in full-time education aged from 16 to 18 years, the registered blind, the disabled and others. A scheme does not have to apply to them all; it is up to the successor authorities to choose the schemes that they want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A scheme can cover different sorts of transport. The 1985 Act refers to public passenger transport services. That includes school transport, but not mini-bus services provided by voluntary associations. Whether such a service would be part of a scheme would depend on a successor authority. Rail services and non-local bus services could be included in so far as they meet the local transport needs of the principal area. A scheme could include social cars, taxis and services that are specially designed to help pensioners or the disabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A single regional authority can agree on the parameters and the detail of the scheme that it wants to implement in its area, but in other areas, with more than three successor authorities, there will be huge potential for disagreement.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1248</span>
Strathclyde may be different because of its PTA, but it is unlikely that areas with several authorities will agree on the same sorts of scheme that were provided through regional councils. It is much more likely that each authority will pursue a concessionary scheme that meets its needs and ignores the needs of others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Gentleman for making him backtrack. If he checks the amendment paper, he will see that Government amendment No. 415 will be debated later. It corrects the intervention of the hon. Member for Angus, East in which he suggested that the Secretary of State for Scotland will retain a right to appoint the chairman of the Strathclyde PTA. The amendment would withdraw that facility, thus underlining the commitment of Conservative Members to devolution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If Conservatives were really committed to the devolution of power to people in Scotland, they would leave the local government structure alone, because the people there say that that is what they want. They believe that the present structure is operating quite adequately. Their priority is the establishment of a Scottish Parliament and thereafter to examine Scotland's priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the likelihood in my area of disagreement between the successor authorities about the concessionary schemes that they want to run, and of their taking their own action, all kinds of problems are likely to arise. Under the boundary arrangements that have been drawn up for the successor authority of Angus, Invergowrie, on the west side of Dundee, remains part of Angus, which is to the east of Dundee. Therefore, if the two areas operated separate concessionary travel schemes, a concessionary travel pass holder in Invergowrie would be able to use it to travel to Monifieth, Carnoustie, Arbroath or Montrose, but not to travel through Dundee. That would be absurd. Students who live outwith Dundee, for example in Blairgowrie, which is represented by the hon. Member for Tayside, North, and who travel to the special needs course at Dundee College of Education, might be able to use the pass up to the Dundee council area boundary, after which they might have to pay full fare to the college. Those would be the practical consequences, unless the three authorities agree. As I have said, agreement is unlikely because of the circumstances that local government reform will create.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point relates to taxi card schemes. They are not mentioned in the 1985 Act, as I understand it, nor in any of the amendments, but they do operate. One was launched in Dundee in 1992 and another in Angus in 1993. One is due to start in Perth and Kinross in 1994. Each area has a different scheme, but they are within the concessionary travel scheme system for the whole of Tayside. I doubt whether the system would continue under the three successor authorities. It is designed particularly for people with disabilities who cannot use public transport. They are allowed 104 journeys a year in Dundee and pay £1 for each journey, to a maximum of a £5 fare. Over that maximum they have to pay the appropriate additional sum. That suits people in Dundee, but not necessarily those in Perth and Kinross or in Angus, where there is a different pattern of journeys. In Dundee
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0692">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1249</span>
taxis move all the time between the peripheral estates and into the city centre. The Angus system has been tailored to meet needs there, so that two fares can be used on the same trip, up to a maximum of a £10 fare, because taxis have to travel further on jouneys in Angus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Flexibility exists in Tayside for the operation of such a taxi card scheme, but it is highly unlikely that the three successor authorities would all choose to fund such a region-wide system. Neither Angus nor Perth and Kinross would be prepared to pay the necessary subsidies for the Dundee scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not share the hon. Gentleman's lack of faith in the new local authorities. I have great faith that where such schemes currently exist—and I believe that a similar one operates in Kincardine and Deeside—new authorities will build on them. They have the flexibility to do that. The hon. Gentleman suggests that new elected bodies are likely to throw out good schemes. The Bill allows them the flexibility to continue them, and I see no reason why they should not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They may not be prepared to carry on with the schemes because of their cost. It is as simple as that. At the moment the cost is borne by Tayside regional council, using money from Tayside regional council tax payers. When taxpayers in Angus wake up to the idea that it is costing them £68,000 a year to run the taxi card system in Dundee, they will tell the Dundee authority that that is its responsibility and not theirs. The concessionary ride system in Tayside will begin to break up. Perth and Kinross will withdraw from the taxi card scheme to run a separate one and Angus will withdraw to run its own scheme. The suggestion will then be to have many separate schemes and give up the joint arrangement. A joint arrangement must be joint.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the hon. Gentleman of one basic fact. As I understand it, 85 per cent, of local government expenditure is funded from central funds. Therefore, of the burden that may be transferred—and there is good reason why it should be the responsibility of the local authority concerned—only 15 per cent, must be borne by that local authority in its local taxation raising power. Is there any reason why there should not be a readjustment with the new local authorities to cover that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is every reason. The hon. Gentleman spoke as if the 85 per cent, was actually calculated on that basis. Let us look at what a local government service costs. The hon. Gentleman asks a question and then turns away. The concessionary travel scheme in Tayside costs £3.5 million. The hon. Gentleman says that the Government subsidise 85 per cent, of that, but that is not how it operates as the hon. Gentleman knows. I agree that 85 per cent, of the total expenditure of local authorities is met, but if local authorities choose to provide services they must fund them entirely themselves. The statutory responsibilities are their first priority. The new authorities with much lower revenue bases will be under severe financial pressure to meet their statutory services. That is why it is important to have a statutory requirement now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it is rather disingenuous of the hon. Member for Kincardine
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1250</span>
and Deeside to talk about the funding of local authorities when his own local authority area is the lowest funded authority in Scotland? It is 33 per cent, below the guideline set by this Tory Government in their spending on local government services. Is that not a clear indication that they would underfund and refuse to put the council tax up to an adequate level to provide the services even at the Government's guideline level rather than at the good level that we would wish to see?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a first class point. At the moment it is not possible to open a national newspaper without reading some Tory Minister's claims that Tory local government costs less than Labour government. The reason that it costs less is that they are not prepared to pay for local government services to people who live in particular areas. That is the difference between the two sides. We put the needs and service requirements of the people we represent first. Then, within reason, we find the means of funding those services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman telling the Committee that Perth and Kinross district council which is Conservative, is not run effectively and efficiently because it has a prudent policy on expenditure? Does he suggest that Angus district council, which is run by the Scottish National party and which also has a prudent expenditure policy is also inefficient?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am suggesting that the first priority of Tory-controlled councils in Scotland is to keep the council tax as low as possible. Everything else follows from that priority. If that means that they must prune services, particularly non-statutory services, that is exactly what they will do. That is the problem with the successor authorities taking over the present concessionary travel schemes: they will not provide them if they do not have to. That is why it is important to put it into statute and to make it a requirement for authorities to contribute to the concessionary schemes. If they are given the choice they will lower the council tax and cut the services and set up a concessionary scheme of their own which will cost considerably less but will not provide the same kind of service to the people in their area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has got Conservative-controlled councils totally wrong. They do, of course, try to get the council tax as low as possible but they do that by using taxpayers' funds to provide the services in a cost-effective way. Many Conservative councils already apply these schemes. I gave the example of Kincardine and Deeside. The hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) unfortunately knocked Kincardine and Deeside for having one of the lowest council taxes in the country. It provides the services and does so cost effectively, within those low levels of costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has, unintentionally, misled the Committee. The concessionary scheme in Kincardine and Deeside is provided by Grampian regional council, which is not Conservative controlled. That is the point I am getting at.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have spoken long enough and I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley is anxious to speak. The Committee must grasp

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1251</span>
the reason why Conservative Members continually say that they do not want this made a statutory requirement. They want to keep a loophole which will allow Conservative-controlled councils in Scotland to opt out of the concessionary schemes which are currently provided through regional councils, none of which is under Conservative control. The Conservatives cannot control the councils because they do not have the votes to get them into power, so they start to break up these schemes. They want to do that through local government reform and create little Tory enclaves that can opt out of the concessionary schemes available from the regional councils. I have tumbled it, my hon. Friends have tumbled it and the Scottish people will tumble it at the next election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that you, Sir James, are a regular user of public transport, because I saw you on it last night.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to elaborate on my earlier remarks about the reception that the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) gave to the delegation that I accompanied on Tuesday. We were genuinely grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his concession. We also appreciated the helpfulness and courtesy of the officials who were present. Above all, I praise the members of the delegation—Lily Kennedy, Bob Harvie, Betty Porter and Bill Fulton. I also thank Linda Martin, the officer who works with the delegation. I honestly believe that if it had not been for the campaign mounted by the Strathclyde Elderly Forum over the past few weeks—especially over the past few days—the Government would not have made this concession. It is to the credit of the members of Strathclyde Elderly Forum, who represent the interests of old and retired people in Strathclyde, that they put pressure on the Government, so we have made the step in the right direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to take one or two more steps in Strathclyde, and a few even further steps regarding the rest of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should there be travel concessions, Sir James? You and I are relatively young and fit. However, the concessions allowing old people to use transport at a reduced rate are vital—they are a lifeline. Concessionary travel schemes allow the elderly to shop, to use health and community care services, to play an active part in their community and to maintain social contacts. Without such concessions, elderly people would become isolated in their own homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I argue strongly that the money spent on concessionary fares is not a cost or a burden, but an investment. By keeping elderly people fit, helping them get out and about and helping them keep their mind and body active, we save a huge amount of money in hospital care, nursing homes and part IV accommodation—a whole range of services that they would otherwise have to use. It is an investment—we are spending £1 today to save £10 tomorrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend had, like me, recently been to an exhibition about opportunities in retirement held in Ayr town hall, he would have seen the fantastic amount of involvement by old people in a whole range of areas in the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall describe briefly the concessionary scheme available in Strathclyde. I am grateful to members of the Strathclyde local government reorganisation unit for the information. I am also grateful to them for their general work in briefing members of the Committee. It has been admirable, and shows one of the many advantages of Strathclyde.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Strathclyde concessionary travel scheme is available to most elderly and many disabled people who are permanently resident or who pay council tax in respect of a second home in the region. The registered blind travel free at all times. The scheme allows those eligible to travel at reduced fares on buses, trains, the Glasgow underground and the Renfrew ferry. It is a pity that my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South is not present to hear that. Those people can use those services at all times after 9 am on weekdays and all day on weekends and public holidays.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

from Ballantrae in the south to Oban in the north. It is a huge area from which people can travel to Glasgow to shop and even my constituents can use the Renfrew ferry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider what the Minister has agreed to so far. The one welcome concession is that the passenger transport authority, as well as individual authorities, can create and organise concessionary fare schemes. The great advantage of that is that everyone in the PTA area will be able to travel to any part of it. From what the Minister said yesterday—this will interest the hon. Member for Tayside, North because it is a welcome move by the Government—the PTA will requisition the cost of the scheme from the councils in its area. Therefore, it will be mandatory on councils to pay for the PTA scheme. That is an excellent step forward. The purpose of the debate is to persuade the Minister and his officials to go some steps further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon. Friend is being characteristically modest about his role. The Committee knows that he shuns publicity. However, it should be placed on the record that the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley facilitated the meeting between Strathclyde Elderly Forum and the Minister. The members of Strathclyde Elderly Forum who were present were delighted at the contribution that my hon. Friend made to the meeting. We are delighted at the campaign organised by the forum. We congratulate it on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I was covered in water earlier; I am now covered in embarrassment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to move a few steps further. I hope that the Minister will consider that carefully. He was sympathetic and appreciated the points made by Strathclyde Elderly Forum. When Lily Kennedy said that there were 400,000 pensioners in Strathclyde, the Minister smiled and said, "Yes. We all have to get re-elected". That is an important point. Pensioners are voters. If I had a majority of fewer than 100 votes, I would be very concerned about the elderly in my constituency. I am at the moment, even with a majority of more than 16,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has not the hon. Gentleman just stated why other local authorities, which operate concessionary schemes for the elderly and disabled, are likely to continue them? They also want to be re-elected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with that in a moment; there are problems with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The number one extension is that of the boundary of the PTA. The Minister's remark on Tuesday, which has not been widely publicised, about there being substantial consultation on the extension of the PTA's boundaries was dealt with earlier. I am keen for the boundaries to extend to include all parts of Ayrshire, as is the hon. Member for Ayr. I use the word "Ayrshire" advisedly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will tell us today the procedure and time scale for the consultation and that he will give a commitment to accept the outcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the appropriate time will probably be after the shadow authorities are put in place on 1 April? The matter could then be taken forward effectively. The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1254</span>
amendment was not appropriate because it was too restrictive. The Government will come forward with an amendment on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for answering my point about the time scale. It would be helpful to know about the procedure: who will be consulted and how? Above all, I would welcome a commitment to accept the outcome of the consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Ayrshire, perhaps we are additionally cynical about consultations because no attention was paid to the outcome of the consultations on the health service or on local government boundaries. I hope that the Minister will pay attention this time and accept it, if the people of Ayrshire want to be included in the PTA area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a problem about cross-boundary eligibility for the concessions, which has not been dealt with. If the PTA is extended as I have suggested and, I hope, as the consultations will show is necessary, there will not be a problem. The concessions will apply throughout the PTA and someone going from Glasgow to Ayrshire will be covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be a problem with Tayside or with Grampian—which interest Conservative Members— because if a scheme is promoted by individual councils, there is no guarantee that there will be cross-boundary provision. People from Kincardine and Deeside may not be able to go to another part of what is currently Grampian region. That is one of the fatal flaws of the proposal. There will be 30 councils in Scotland, including 12 in the Strathclyde PTA area. There is no guarantee of cross-boundary arrangements being made in the remaining 18 council areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note the hon. Gentleman's point, but in the case of Grampian, where the new local authority will be rural Aberdeenshire, which is the vast majority of Grampian—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not Aberdeen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—excluding Aberdeen city, there will be less of a problem. Does not the hon. Gentleman accept that what is the right concession, for example, for Aberdeen city may not be appropriate in rural areas? It is right to leave flexibility to apply the most appropriate form of assistance to an area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What worries me is that the hon. Gentleman's remarks about flexibility are taken by him and Conservative-controlled authorities to mean the lowest common denominator. The hon. Gentleman helpfully described the problem. There is some use for concessions in Kincardine and Deeside, but what if his constituents cannot travel to Aberdeen, the centre of the region where most shopping is done and where Pittodrie is situated? People want to travel to see the team play. What use would a concession be if it did not extend throughout the region?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon.

receiving instructions from the hon. Member for Falkirk, East. Is he saying that he has absolutely no faith that the single-tier authorities will get together to allow concessionary travel to their contiguous authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely what I am not saying, but it will be much more difficult for those authorities to organise it and to come to agreement on how much they will pay. Tory authorities will want all the services but not to pay anything for them. We have seen that again and again and again. That is what will happen. Whereas, if our amendment is accepted they will get together and a PTA will have the authority to create those concessions for the whole of what is currently Grampian region and then requisition the costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's knowledge of geography is pretty scant. We are talking mostly about bus transport if we are talking about Tayside, which he mentioned. The bulk of the trunk route mileage by the buses operated in that area, whoever operates them, is clocked up in the rural areas and not in Dundee. Any concession, even if it only took people to the boundary of Dundee, would take them the bulk of the way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not talking about Dundee. I am not sure what the advantage is of taking old people the bulk of the way and leaving them on the boundaries of Dundee to walk in. The hon.

I am speaking at the moment and I am not giving way. Let me deal with the hon. Member one point at a time. He challenges my knowledge of the geography of Scotland. I have visited every premier division ground in Scotland, so I know the geography of Scotland as well as any member of the Committee. I will not be challenged on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman fails to understand how bus companies operate commercially. If they enter into agreement with whoever on any kind of concessionary fare arrangement they do not then chuck people off at any given stop. They reach an agreement for the whole journey and the concession for the part of the journey that they receive is what we are talking about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Member is an expert on this. He is a director of Stagecoach UK.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I do know a little bit about concessionary fares. I worked with Age Concern for a long time. It is much more difficult to agree concessionary fares when all the authorities are not co-ordinated. It is much better when there is a PTA. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. We have seen that the schemes are much more effective where there is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1256</span>
a PTA or a regional council covering the whole area that is willing to organise and fund those schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier on the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside put forward a strong argument about Tory-controlled authorities providing services efficiently. He said that they charged less and provided better services than Labour-controlled authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The hon. Gentleman confirms that. There are four district councils in Ayrshire. Which has the highest council tax? I will give way to the hon. Gentleman to see whether he can answer the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Kyle and Carrick has a higher council tax than would have been appreciated because a previous Labour administration squandered resources. The council is turning that around and is using its cash for a massive expansion of service provision, which will benefit local people. That gives the lie to some earlier comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon. Gentleman is wrong. He says that the tax is based on past expenditure, which is not the case. It is based on projected expenditure for the next financial year. Of the four councils—Cumnock and Doon Valley, Kyle and Carrick, Kilmarnock and Loudoun and Cunninghame—Kyle and Carrick has a far higher council tax. The other three have about the same level, but the tax in Kyle and Carrick is way above that. It also has the highest council house rents and the poorest services. That gives the lie to the hon. Member's comments, but that is a little off the subject, to which I should return.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have asked the Minister to consider extending the PTA area. If an area in Strathclyde is not included in the PTA area after the consultation and the Minister's decision, I hope that, at the very least, the PTA will have the power to act as an agent for the concessionary fares in that district council area. There could then be a scheme to cover the whole of Strathclyde.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We come now to the rest of Scotland. I support the plea of my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian. Under pressure from pensioners and the threat of annihilation at elections, I think that the Government will move further on the subject. If there is to be provision for Strathclyde, it would be intolerable if it did not apply to the rest of Scotland. I say that as a Strathclyde Member of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

allowing concessionary fares elsewhere. Nothing could be further from the truth. Concessionary fares exist elsewhere. If local government wants to provide concessionary fares, it can. The beauty of the Government's proposals is that there is flexibility to apply them in the way most appropriate to each local area. Will the hon. Gentleman accept that—yes or no?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have sat through almost all the debate and certainly through every one of the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Flexibility means the opportunity for them to do nothing if they wish. Given the track record of Tory-controlled authorities, they will opt out and not participate in the schemes. The trouble is that the hon. Gentleman is either talking to his hon. Friends or is thinking about his next intervention. He does not listen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member for Kincardine and Deeside continues, he will be shown the yellow card, and we know what follows that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Flexibility means that it will be much more difficult to obtain the comprehensive schemes that we have been discussing. We have a comprehensive scheme in Strathclyde. Fife, too, has a comprehensive scheme, which will continue because Fife is to continue as an authority. However, I worry about Tayside, Grampian and Lothian, because their schemes operate in authorities that will be broken up. There will be no guarantee of schemes' continuation—either at all or as cross-boundary operations. We need to pin the new local authorities down and obtain a guarantee of some kind. In my view, the old people of Tayside, Grampian and Lothian deserve as much as those of Strathclyde.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We have been told daily for the past 18 months by the Labour Front Bench that the local government reforms will lead to a wipe-out of the Conservative party in local government. Hon. Gentlemen cannot deny that—indeed, they confirm it. They say that they will control virtually every one of the new, single-tier local authorities, yet today they argue that no concessionary fare schemes will operate and no cross-boundary concessions will be arranged. By their words today they have damned their local government colleagues. They have no faith that those colleagues will get together to ensure cross-boundary
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1258</span>
concessionary fares and the operation of systems similar to the Strathclyde passenger transport executive. They cannot have it both ways. They cannot tell us that they will control local authorities and complain that successor authorities will not operate cross-boundary concessionary fares. They have told us and every pensioner in Scotland, "Vote Labour and we will stop concessionary travel, and not allow concessionary fares across boundaries."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To take as an example my area of Grampian, the hon. Members for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley and for Dundee, East, envisage the Aberdeenshire authority creating a travel concession scheme, but the city of Aberdeen—which they claim will be controlled by the Labour party—refusing to co-operate with the Aberdeenshire authority. A wall will be created around the city, preventing pensioners and others who are entitled to concessionary travel from travelling from the country to the city. The Labour-controlled city of Aberdeen authority will prevent it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for Dundee, East says that the pensioners of Tayside will not be allowed to travel in to Dundee, because the Labour-controlled, single-tier authority there will stop them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said the opposite of what the hon. Gentleman claims. I believe that the concessionary scheme in Tayside will cease because Tory-controlled Perth and Kinross will cease to operate it, not because of Dundee's unwillingness to run it. I can make a commitment that every Labour authority in Scotland will support a concessionary scheme. The hon. Gentleman's remarks imply that he is suggesting that not a single Tory council will survive the next local elections. I suspect that in some areas Tory councils will remain and will undermine the concessionary schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the 	<i>Official Report</i> is read the hon. Gentleman will have to eat his words, because I said no such thing. The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley said that flexibility means doing nothing. According to Labour Members, most, if not all, of the new councils will be Labour-controlled. That means that they will have the flexibility to do nothing. The debate must be read throughout Scotland, by all pensioners, because it is obvious which side of this Committee is on their side—the Conservatives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am reminded that the new chair of the Scottish Labour party said at conference that when he spoke to a health Minister, the Minister said, "Blobby, blobby, blobby." We have in Committee our own version of Mr. Blobby—Mr. Blobby for Aberdeen, South. Instead of intelligently interpreting what hon. Members have said, he has not even listened to them. He has just said, "Blobby, blobby, blobby." People who read the debate will realise that the hon. Gentleman is just as stupid as the television character. What he said was a crass misrepresentation and he knows it. It may be better not to say anything, because he has revealed the difference between the way in which the Conservatives look at the possibilities for the transport authorities in Scotland, and the way in which we look at them.

An incident that occurred before the Bill was introduced probably guaranteed the continued existence of the passenger transport authority for Strathclyde. Strathclyde said that it would not put £20 million into new rolling stock unless the authority's existence was guaranteed. That is why the PTA appears in the Bill. Strathclyde said that if rail transport in Strathclyde is not supported by a large strategic authority, such as the PTA, it cannot fund its rolling stock or provide an adequate service. The Government, therefore, have accepted the provision for a PTA in the Bill. Without Strathclyde, we would not have the passenger transport network or the concessions that exist in the west of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have debated the question of school transport. My hon. Friend the Member for Govan, a former chairman of Strathclyde regional education authority, said that it ran a two-mile and a one-mile scheme for children. They do not have to live three miles or two miles away from the school, depending on their age, to receive concessions. I am gravely worried that such schemes will not be continued in authorities run by Conservative councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle of supporting and subsidising transport and of giving everyone—and not just the elderly—the chance to travel is underlined by the actions of Labour authorities. The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South tried to misrepresent the facts, but those who do not study history are doomed to repeat it. He does not study history and in future people in Kincardine and Deeside and Aberdeenshire will go through the traumas in which they are denied the kind of support for transport that they would receive if they lived in the cities of Aberdeen or Dundee. The authorities in those cities are Labour. They will continue the history of subsidised transport. There is no history of a Conservative authority putting forward or initiating a scheme of subsidised transport. The Bill appears to offer flexibility. History shows us that when flexibility is in the hands of Conservative authorities, it means that they have a choice not to act, not a choice to act.

If we consider Central region, which is the area I know best so I do not apologise for discussing it, the current transport system shows that there will be difficulties. For example, 65 per cent, of the people in Clackmannan district travel to Stirling for work and for shopping. In
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1260</span>
the Stirling and Falkirk area, people travel to and from Falkirk for employment purposes. Those areas will be divided. At the moment, the areas are under one authority with an integrated transport policy and programmes, which are known to people and debated by the people of in all areas Central region. That policy is supported by people in all of the areas, including parts of Stirling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely correct. Among the favourite concessionary journeys undertaken by people from my constituency are those to places such as Stirling and Callander.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is correct.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, we are being genuinely helpful. The spirit of the amendment would lead us back to common sense. We cannot plan transport in Scotland without crossing boundaries. Transport is arranged by regions with other regions and with the PTA of Strathclyde.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has been asked to put a combined planning, policy and operational framework into place in the regions. There is no sense in not doing that. There is nothing to be won by the Government in terms of politics or administration. The only thing that we can say is that some of the new authorities may not, because of the boundary-led fiasco, spend on transport in the same way as the existing regions. That worries us.
