	<p>[Continuation from column 1506]</p>
	<p>9 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is nice to welcome you to the Chair, Sir James. What an exciting day you have missed. I am sure that the next few hours will also be exciting. During our break, I though about the absence for the rest of the evening of the hon. Member for Tayside, North. It would be difficult for the hon. Gentleman to find sufficient competition for an award for brass neck. He had a social engagement, which, understandably, he wanted to keep. However, many of us have had to give up social engagements. First, the hon. Member for Tayside, North moved the closure on the debate on the motion. Secondly, he voted to begin consideration of the important subject of water, finally, he left for a social engagement. That is breathtaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Might it not be that Ministers suggested to Conservative Members that it would be less embarrassing if the one Conservative Member who spoke vociferously about the need to privatise water services was removed from the Committee while we discussed the topic?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would be an advantage to the Government. My hon. Friend makes an important point. It is especially relevant because "Reporting Scotland" this evening included an interview with the hon. Member for Ayr, who said that the Government should make a commitment now, in Committee, not to privatise water. The terrible twins sit side by side. One says, "Privatise", the other says, "Don't".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman continually comes into Committee with rumours about what has occurred outside. The comments that he has just made are not at all accurate. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I did not suggest that other hon. Members should sign up to such a policy. The hon. Gentleman should get his facts right before he opens his mouth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Withdraw.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. Because of the barracking of Conservative Members, I did not hear the comments of the hon. Member for Ayr. I want the matter to be clarified. Will you permit him to make his statement again, Sir James?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I heard it, and I think that 	<i>Hansard</i> heard it, too. I hope that hon. Members will direct their
	<span class='label label-info column'>1508</span>
remarks to new water and sewerage authorities, which is the subject of the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course you are right, Sir James. The clause and the amendments raise the issue of privatisation and the Government's intentions for the new authorities. If I misrepresented the hon. Member for Ayr, and he did not make the statement that I attributed to him on television this evening, I apologise. Will he tell the Committee what he said on the television programme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I clarified the matter earlier. I expressed my own opinion, but I did not say that the Government should make the statement that the hon. Gentleman outlined. I said that it would be unwise for a Minister to make such a commitment. I did not determine what others should say. I simply expressed my own opinion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will have the chance to vote on several key amendments. He can express his opinion on those rather than in a few sound bites on "Reporting Scotland". The hon. Member for Ayr said that the Conservative party should go into the next election with a commitment that they would not privatise water in Scotland. He normally sits next to the hon. Member for Tayside, North—who is absent at the moment—who has told us that he wants to privatise Scottish water. The hon. Member for Ayr is surrounded by other Conservative Members who disagree with him on that issue. Can anybody wonder that the Scottish people are getting confused about Conservative policy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for suddenly bringing a new philosophy to bear on politics—that every member of every political party has to agree with anything. Does the hon. Gentleman agree with every policy espoused by every Opposition Member?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the greatest respect, we are examining Her Majesty's Government and their proposals for the future of water. We will also have to examine the Government's motives for the proposals. That is why the question of privatisation is relevant to the group of amendments and to the whole debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have spent a large chunk of today being told by Conservative Members, including Ministers, that people in Strathclyde had got it all wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some Conservative Members had imagined that the Government intended to privatise Scotland's water but the Minister said, "No, we're not going to privatise. Goodness gracious, that is not an option anymore. It's not on the menu." It is as if water privatisation was some sort of consomme that had been wiped off the Conservative party menu.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people of Scotland are suspicious—I shall develop that argument in a minute—and no wonder. The hon. Member for Tayside, North demanded that we debate water now and then he departed from the Room. He told us that he was in favour of the privatisation of Scottish water. But the hon. Member for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0836">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1509</span>
Ayr, with his wafer-thin majority and having studied the figures from his constituency, is moving into the populist area of recognising that his constituents have every reason to worry about the Government's ultimate objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments provide the missing ingredient about which the Prime Minister has clearly not been told by the junior Ministers on the Committee. The Prime Minister would have had us believe at Prime Minister's Question Time today that we have no alternative to the Government's proposal. Into that vacuum comes an infinitely reasonable Government with their plan for three super quangos. The quangos are there because they are abolishing all regional councils and are creating 30, 31, 32, 33, 35 new unitary authorities. Therefore, that automatically means that they must create a three-quango structure for water. The amendments provide an alternative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We in the Opposition do not have an assembled knowledge bank of civil servants to guide us. We do not have parliamentary draftsmen and the people to whom we cannot refer who are in the room to advise Ministers. The civil servants in the Scottish Office have a good, able reputation and are there to take Ministers views, however bizarre, unreasonable and unpopular, and translate them into legislation. Her Majestry's Opposition are not given the resources to do that. Therefore, I am willing to admit that our amendments may not be technically correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are providing a framework and a model. We are proposing logical, reasonable and practical amendments. Our proposals for 12 water authorities would bring the crucial issue of the control of water closer to the people and would provide a transparent way in which that commodity could be accountable. If the Government are willing to accept that principle then I shall withdraw the amendments in favour of Government amendments that would have the same effect and be technically correct. If that were the Government's position tonight, we could all go home feeling reasonably satisfied that the voice of the people of Scotland had been heard. I wonder whether that is on the menu, as the Minister would say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Behind the debate tonight are 150 years of public control of water. Earlier this evening we were drinking Strathclyde water—I see that a number of the bottles on the Conservative Benches have been consumed. That water comes from Loch Katrine. It is among the purest water available for drinking anywhere in western Europe. So pure that, in the days when one had to top up a car battery, Loch Katrine water could be used instead of distilled water. The water for Glasgow used to be provided by profit-making companies. That was 150 years ago, in the days of health hazards and health problems, but there were no socialists in power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: More is the shame.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. Things would have been different, had we been around. The people who took water supply out of the hands of the fractionalised water companies and put it into public
	<span class='label label-info column'>1510</span>
ownership were wise enough to perceive that only through the public sector could the necessary investment be made in that key commodity, which is so crucial for the health of the nation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, although our predecessors took the water from Loch Katrine and piped it into Glasgow city, the problem is that the original pipework is still in place? The modern authorities have not upgraded or maintained that pipework. That is the responsibility of the local authorities. They were irresponsible, and will now lose control of water provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have heard some breathtaking stuff in this Committee, but that takes the biscuit. The hon. Gentleman says that the public authorities did not upgrade pipes or invest in new pipework. Who controls the purse strings?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Regional councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Regional councils, says the hon Member for Ayr—from a sedentary position, with his head in the sand. Of course not. The reality is that borrowing consents, which were requested time and again, come from central Government. The hon. Member for Eastwood said only recently that 88 per cent. of local authority finance comes from central Government. They determine the level of investment in our public utilities, including water.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our generation is proud to be able to drink the water from our taps. People in other European countries envy our access to that key commodity. The market was not able to deliver portable water supplies to the nation. There is no reason to think that the private sector will be in a better position to make the investments and perform the maintenance that will deliver to the people of Scotland the quality of water to which they rightly have become accustomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told that the Bill will ensure the maintenance of the provision of high quality water, but the consultative document states, in paragraphs 3.1:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Water and sewerage services in Scotland are of high quality and the Government intend that they should remain so."</p></blockquote>
If they are of a high quality, why are they being changed around? Why is the private sector ingredient, which the Government believe to be so important, being imported into that sector?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about public responsiveness? Over the years, the good burghers of our municipalities—be they Conservative, Labour or Liberal—all believed that to be a crucial part of water supply. They believed public responsiveness to be crucial. Would they have seen any wisdom in the creation of three superquangos, of which the members would be the appointees of the Secretary of State, accountable to the public only through the person of the Secretary of State?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does anybody believe that scale of expenditure will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0837">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1511</span>
be provided better by the private sector or by a mixture of the private and public sectors, as the Government propose? That misses out the element of why water is so important in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour Members do not believe that water is a God-given product that is sentimentally special. Water is special for every other reason that one can imagine. It is crucial for public health, which is why 95 per cent. of the water consumed in Scotland comes from the public sector. People have become used to the standards and protection provided by local authorities that deliver their water supplies efficiently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have made a concession. Chapter 5 of the consultation paper begins:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The local nature of the services would be retained and over the years local authorities, of various sizes and configurations, have shown that they can effectively deliver water and sewerage services."</p></blockquote>
Those are the Government's own words. That is the unvarnished truth behind the fact that 95 per cent. of our water supplies come from the public sector. The Government's words provide the justification for why they should remain there. Water is not another commodity to be placed in the hands of the market place—it is central and crucial. The reliability, cleanliness and safety of water supplies are taken for granted by our citizens, because water supplies are in the hands of public authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today, we argued about privatisation. As the hon. Member for Ayr conceded, the public are suspicious and they want to be reassured that the proposals for three quangos will not lead to privatisation. Over the years of the Conservative Government, apparently innocent ideas have come along and most of them are sold in exactly the same way. They are presented as though they will lead to cost efficiency and the effective delivery of services. However, we then get policies such as those for trust hospitals and the poll tax. Some of the measures come, some go. Some stay, and some are doomed right from the start.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under exactly the same pressures, the Government introduced full-scale privatisation in England and Wales. People are right to expect that the hon. Member for Stroud and others in the Conservative party will, if they get the chance after the next election, utilise the building blocks that the Bill will put in place to move on to the model of England and Wales, which led to massive disconnections south of the border. Although current law in Scotland protects people from that, there is no explicit long-term protection. The law has been changed with gay abandon over the years, in so many areas, so offers no protection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will recall that during Scottish Question Time yesterday, the hon. Member for Hendon, South (Mr. Marshall), the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Leader of the House, asked about the privatisation of Scottish water and referred to the advantages that would bring. If the hon. Member for Hendon, South is representative of English Conservative members, it is clear that they believe that Scottish water will be privatised. If that hon. Gentle-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1512</span>
man has the opportunity to troop through the Lobby to support such a proposal, that is exactly what he will do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has a point. There are plenty of such Conservative Members. The hon. Member for Stroud is one, even though he is not present in Committee at the moment. I do not know whether he is at Buckingham palace or some other exotic location. He is probably plotting against the Government somewhere. Plenty of Conservative party members see privatisation as the next step. The Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Dumfries, may well not consider it a good alternative. The Government were certainly scared off it in a big way last year. That is why the present proposal has been made. No guarantee for the people of Scotland are built into the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do we not already have signals about where the Government are going? For example, the Minister responsible for this part of the legislation has been selling forestry land without the access agreements that have always been written into the responsibilities of new owners. For the first time the concept of aggravated trespass is to come to Scotland, through the Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill. That will fundamentally change the relationship between the Scottish people and the land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is why Conservative voters throughout Scotland are suspicious. Although the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Dumfries, will probably give another version of his earlier assurance, that is not a guarantee that is likely to hold terribly much with us, to coin a phrase. My hon. Friend rightly said that in other areas different terms are found for the same destinations. The same problems and inhumanity that disconnections brought about south of the border are likely, together with the same bloated salaries that were the hallmark, in the initial stages, of the privatised water companies in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The promises of large amounts of private capital that were supposed to flow into the privatised companies and to fund all the investment spoken of by the hon. Member for Ayr, were not fulfilled. In reality the consumer had to pay the price through higher charges for water supply and investment, despite the £5 million giveaway to the new privatised companies, on top of which was the so-called green dowry. People in the south know the price of water privatisation and people in Scotland fear that if the Government advance the proposal as they have been describing, they will be in the same position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments about our proposal. I dare say that he will be able to nit-pick his way through some of our amendments, but we believe that 12 elected water authorities would constitute a logical, practical and workable system of delivering water, which would also be responsive to the people that it served. It is not unusual. In 1973, which is not all that long ago, 234 local authorities in Scotland were providing water and sewerage services for the people of Scotland. In 1975 that number was rationalised down to 12. It has worked efficiently and effectively since then, as the consultative document says. If
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0838">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1513</span>
that arrangement is good enough to provide fire and police services on the basis of joint boards comprising elected councillors why is it not appropriate to provide water and sewerage on exactly the same basis, continuing that fine tradition of public involvement in a public utility?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson) appears to be puzzled—as he is constantly, no doubt, just because of being here—but the Government have established the principle of joint boards to look after police and fire services. If that is appropriate why is not the same approach to water appropriate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is now waxing eloquent about the advantages of joint boards for police and fire services and whatever. Why, then, did he move amendments and, when he was here, vote against those arrangements?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not surprisingly, and not for the first time, the hon. Gentleman misses the point. The Government say that there must be three superquangos to deliver water. This afternoon, the Prime Minister told the House that the regions were being abolished—that 31 unitary authorities could not deliver water services. Since there was no feasible alternative arrangement in the Government's mind, three super-quangos were needed. The Prime Minister was presumably reading from a brief written by people who had not given him the whole picture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South voted earlier in Committee to deliver crucial police and fire services by means of joint boards, he did that—not me, not the Opposition. It was the hon. Gentleman and all the Conservative Members who thought it appropriate to deliver those services by means of joint boards, composed of elected councillors from the areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For these services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says for these services. He is repeating what I am saying. I am glad, because eventually he will learn and repeat more of what I say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The model is there and the country must wait for the Government to tell them why, if it is good enough for those services it is not good enough for water. The argument is that is being done because there is a need for capital. The consultative document is specific about how much capital will be required for investment to bring water and sewerage services to the standard that consumers will require and to the obligations that past and future European Union directives will impose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consultative document states that £5 billion will be required in the next 10 to 15 years. That is the contention and the basis of the three superquango model, with no elected councillors guaranteed on any of them. It is predicated totally and solely on the basis that no private capital will be attracted unless it is in the hands of the superquangos. That is absurd. There is nothing to say that an investment of that specific
	<span class='label label-info column'>1514</span>
amount is required over the next 10 to 15 years because many experts in the field says that it could be invested over the next 15 to 20 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important point in view of the Government's misleading statements in Scotland. Of that £5 billion, only £2.5 billion will be extra requirements because the local authorities at present do an excellent job. When that is measured over 15 years, it is very easily managed. It is nonsense that three superquangos will be needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The reality is that the information available and the expert advice given—	<i>[Interuption].</i> The Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Eastwood, should read the referendum results with the same care as before and lose more hair as a consequence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important issue—it is a not a laughing matter for the hon. Gentleman. He is in deep enough trouble with his electors to remain silent as argument is advanced. He attempts to sell his ideas to the decreasing number of people who are convinced that super quangos must be created for the investment to be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if the £5 billion were invested over the next 10 to 15 years, and even if capital consents were given to local authorities at the present time, the calculation by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities—I have yet to hear it denied—is that in the period that we are discussing, it would involve an extra charge to the people of Scotland of only £2 a year. That is half a penny a day as an extra charge for providing the investment that the hon. Member for Ayr says that nobody made in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are constrained by calculations of what is defined by the public sector borrowing requirement—a constraint that many of our continental partners do not find so binding on their activities. The Minister may deny it, but COSLA has stated that that is the required figure, which is not unreasonable for improving water supplies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall debate later the transparency of the process by which authorities will deliver the service. In this context, however, it is important to consider how the 12 authorities can establish a framework that will be close to and accountable to the people. Some of the representations made to members of the Committee have been most persuasive, especially those from the Scottish Landowners Federation about the accountability of the new authorities. Other representations might have been dismissed by the bovver boys on the Conservative Benches, such as the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South, as predictable responses of the paid lackeys of the regional councils. However, not even in his wildest dreams would the hon. Gentleman categorise the Scottish Landowners Federation in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The federation says that it
	<br><blockquote><p>"does not believe that the Bill as drafted provides adequate customer protection and is concerned that rural consumers may be particularly
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0839">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1515</span>
vulnerable to changes which may be introduced by the new authorities."</p></blockquote>
That important point must be borne in mind. Fiddling around with the proposed customers' council does not get to the root of the issue. Accountability can be genuinely guaranteed only if it is in the hands of people who can be replaced by the people. That is the key. I do not maintain that it should be run for all time by Labour councillors, however good, able, efficient and effective they are in delivering services. I want to ensure that councillors are accountable and can be replaced if they do not come up to the high standards that the people have established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are based on the two key components of 12 authorities which represent the different parts of Scotland and which comprise elected councillors who are accountable to the electors. We do not advocate a revolutionary measure; we are arguing for logical, sensible and practical proposals. If the Government continue to spit in the face of public opinion and reject our modest proposals, they will pay a high price. They are the ones who are misleading the Scottish people and are misguided. We have provided them with a way out: I hope that they take it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important part of the Bill. The supply of water and sewerage services is important to all our constituencies and to the whole of Scotland. We have listened to the hon. Member for Hamilton talking about a vast array of subjects. The thread of the Opposition's argument is scaremongering. There has been much inaccuracy quoted to and scaremongering among vulnerable people who are worried about some of the hon. Gentleman's tales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been talk of disconnections. How often must my hon. Friend the Minister and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State have to explain to the Opposition that no legislation in Scotland empowers disconnections and that there is no intention of introducing such legislation? Scotland does not have to be the same as south of the border. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has come up with different proposal for the structure of water services from that for south of the border.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is forever telling me in particular that we live in a unitary state. Can he explain why it is right for ordinary people in England and Wales to be disconnected from the water supply, but not right for people in our part of the United Kingdom? As five Conservative Members think that their constituents should be disconnected, why should I believe that they do not want my constituents to be disconnected as well?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the hon. Gentleman says, but I do not intend to be drawn into that because, as far as I am aware, we are debating the Local Government Etc. (Scotland) Bill, whose proposals are somewhat different from those for south of the border.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that there will be no disconnections, and I am very glad to hear it. Can
	<span class='label label-info column'>1516</span>
he also guarantee that there will be no self-disconnections, as in England, where metering was introduced for exactly that purpose? I believe that 60,000 people had their domestic water supply cut off in England last year. I never want to see that obscenity visited on Scotland. Can the hon. Gentleman give a similar guarantee about self-disconnections through metering?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly do not want to see anyone disconnected from the water supply. I want an organisation to be set up that gives the best possible service at the smallest possible price to the consumer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hamilton asked why we cannot make arrangements similar to those relating to the joint boards on police and fire services. There is one very simple answer: I am not aware that either the police or the fire service will require £5 billion of capital expenditure over the next 10 to 15 years. That may be dismissed as irrelevant by Opposition Members, but it is an important element of any plan for running water services in Scotland. It is very important to have units of a size that can manage to raise funds and to run water services adequately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scotland is a very large area, with a broad population spread—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not wish the hon. Gentleman to move on to his next point without giving some comments on his assessment of the service provided by Grampian. I have heard nothing from the Government criticising local authorities' delivery. Is he saying that his constituents are complaining about Grampian's services?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman mentions Grampian. Indeed, there is no doubt that people in Grampian has been very well served by the regional water services. There is, however a changing population in my constituency and in Grampian as a whole. People have benefited from the Government's policies over the past 15 years and the advent of oil to Aberdeen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which came first?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A little oil and a little Conservative policy. The changing population and the growing communities in my constituency during the time that I have been involved with it have led to a pressing need for new plant and equipment, particularly for sewage treatment. Finding the funds for such equipment is difficult, unless one has access to a significant amount of funding at a reasonable price. We should bear that in mind when talking about the water services structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we said in the debate this afternoon, the Opposition have been scaremongering, and those who listen to what they say are worried, whether they be pensioners or disabled people—those less fortunate than us. Such people note that the Opposition are saying, "save your water". We are trying to ensure that we give the best possible service to all our customers and to provide the best quality water throughout Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members are well accustomed to frightening disabled people and old-age pensioners. We saw
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0840">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1517</span>
that recently regarding VAT on fuel. I do not want to pursue that point, but I mentioned it yesterday during Scottish questions. The Opposition did not tell old-age pensioners that the Government's package will provide compensation for fuel. They behaved the same over concessionary fares, which we debated earlier in our proceedings. I would be very surprised if the new local authorities do away with concessionary fares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the provision of water in Scotland. Under the present local government structure, people in rural areas can feel that they occasionally lose out to those covered by the city authorities. We need a broader approach to the provision of services to ensure that they are supplied in a business-like and professional manner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is talking in the most broad-brush terms about new starts and new approaches. Will he specify how the three proposed quangos would fund their services? The local authorities gave evidence to the Minister about how the £5 billion would be funded. How would the quangos do it differently? We need something specific, some hard facts. How will it be different?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They will have a high degree of flexibility if they are set up to cover large areas, such as Grampian. I want to deal, however, with the expertise available in raising the funds. Opposition Members propose that any water authorities, whether they are smaller or greater in number than at present, should be full of elected councillors. Elected councillors can give a valuable input into water authorities, but are they sufficiently able and proficient to run such large businesses? Will they have the City contacts to raise sufficient funds? We are moving into an era of high capital spending. It is true that much has been spent on water and sewerage, but more must be done. The hon. Member for Falkirk, East spoke about the people of Grampian. They are satisfied with their existing services, but they want further expenditure to ensure that existing communities flourish and develop.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend recall the words of the hon. Member for Hamilton, who complained earlier about the limitations on local authority funding for water and sewerage infrastructure? Local authorities are restricted by public sector borrowing limitations. That would not be the case with the proposed new public bodies. They will be able to attract funding from other areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend hits the nail on the head. Opposition Members do not worry about public sector borrowing. We heard what they proposed at the previous general election. What was it—an extra £35 billion, or £40 billion? It seemed to change every day. They have withdrawn all those pledges. The Opposition spokesman on social security has no pledges, even for pensioners. No pensions are now guaranteed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ayr has opened up an interesting subject. Will the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside say whether the Government consider that the three quangos that will be created will operate wholly outwith the public sector borrowing
	<span class='label label-info column'>1518</span>
requirement—the bottom line laid down by the Treasury?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Gentleman, I await with great interest what my hon. Friend the Minister will say. I hope that the flexibility permitted in the Bill will allow the new authorities to raise funds so that they are not a burden on the public sector borrowing requirement. I hope that significantly increased capital expenditure will be possible at significantly lower rates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the public sector borrowing requirement, it has been agreed by local authorities and the Government that a figure of £3 billion could count towards the cost of the £5 billion capital expenditure without causing an increase in the capital allowances given to local authorities. Does the hon. Gentleman support that continued funding at £3 billion? That would leave £2 billion to be raised by other means. Or is he trying to say that the £3 billion public sector borrowing requirement can be withdrawn so that the three new quangos will fund themselves by some other means?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that we can embark on this exercise with the maximum flexibility, bearing in mind the consumer. Our first task is to address the consumer's needs. We have to ensure that there is a good quality water supply and that there is good sewage treatment, especially in rural areas and where small communities are in the process of growth. Capital expenditure problems must be tackled in the most cost-effective way for the consumer. Therefore, it is also most cost-effective for the Government to ensure that the provision of that service does not impair other services that they have to fund through the PSBR.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is arguing from economies of scale. I urge caution. He advocates a giant northern water board that stretches from Perthshire to the Western Isles and Orkney and Shetland. That area covers a massive price range. When the price is averaged, the hon. Gentleman's constituents will pay far more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will find that the schedule includes a provision that permits a variety of charges. That worries me, because rural areas may be charged more than cities. I shall seek assurances from my hon. Friend the Minister that rural consumers will receive a fair deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Angus, East knows that electricity services have been well served by a large authority in the north of Scotland. Scottish Hydro-electric plc a public utility, delivers services. Something similar can be done with water services. One can establish a professional service organisation to ensure good service more easily in one large area than in many small areas. I know that that is difficult for the Opposition to understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Small service companies in industry have struggled, but have set themselves up well by becoming members
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0841">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1519</span>
of larger groups and tapping into the central organisation of a larger body. A larger authority can achieve that more easily than many small authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek clarification about the hon. Gentleman's comments on charges to rural areas. He said that he wanted to ensure that rural areas were not unfairly penalised simply because services were more expensive to deliver there. I understand that, but how does he square that with his and other Conservative Members' view that police services should be delivered in the opposite way? Police charges in cities are deemed to be more expensive, but the hon. Gentleman did not believe that the charges should be shared equally so that rural areas paid their fair share. His views are inconsistent. Is he not simply seeking the best deal for his constituents?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The obvious answer is yes. I represent a rural constituency and I want the best deal for my constituents. I want to ensure that they have the best possible police and water services. However, I shall concentrate on water and sewerage. Some people in my constituency do not have mains water. They wish to obtain mains water in future. Under current funding restrictions, it is difficult for people in rural areas to justify a water service to water services departments. They join a queue and wait for a considerable period of time. Under a larger set up, which has the ability to raise funds and has more flexible management, rural consumers could obtain mains water more quickly. The Opposition propose 12 authorities in Scotland. Each authority will have a structure and overheads. I believe that we should streamline the existing authorities in order to get to grips with the capital expenditure programme for the future and to obtain the best and most efficient delivery of service. We will do that through rationalisation and by creating a larger authority under one roof.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home-Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am fascinated by the contrast between the argument that the hon. Gentleman advances now, that the regional water authorities should be wrapped up and made into a larger authority, and the line that he has taken on all other local services, which is that the regional authority should be broken up and made smaller. How does he square those two arguments: he cannot have it both ways? Cannot he grasp that his constituents are currently getting good service and good value for money? Why does he want to take the present system to bits?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The director of water services for Grampian gave a presentation to the community council in Aboyne, my local village. It was during the water consultation period and he advocated that a measure similar to that proposed in the Bill should be adopted as soon as possible. He was concerned about the need to raise capital expenditure. He wants to ensure that the future service will be as good as the present one, bearing in mind that capital expenditure is required, whether it be for the replacement of worn-out equipment, to bring quality standards to correct levels or to provide sewage treatment for growing communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need a unit authority of the size proposed in the clause. We could debate whether there should be four
	<span class='label label-info column'>1520</span>
authorities instead of three, or whether there should be two.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or one?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One would not provide competition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Competition, through two taps?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The suggestion of competition may cause mirth, but I hope that as a consumer the hon. Gentleman would want his local water authority to compete so that he could make comparisons and say, "Hang on, we're paying £X and they are paying significantly less."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is talking as though the present water services in Scotland were grossly inefficient, the opposite is true: they give a high quality, low cost service. How does the hon. Gentleman's view square with the fact that in the Scottish regions, including Central, Fife, Strathclyde, Lothian, Highland, Dumfries and Galloway, the cost-per-unit of water delivered is far lower than that of the privatised English companies? Portsmouth is slightly ahead of Grampian, but in terms of cost-per-unit of water delivered our existing authorities are very efficient.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The one difference between south and north of the border is that the English companies are a little ahead of us, because they have embarked on a significant capital expenditure programme and so are having to bear the cost of that. Whatever we do—even if we were keeping the exisiting authorities and were not introducing local government reform—it is a fact of life that that £5 billion has to be found. Whatever happens, the cost of water will go up in Scotland in the next 10 to 15 years. In England it has gone up because of capital expenditure. Almost all of the water companies south of the border have had to raise extra capital expenditure. We are trying to ensure that that inevitable increase is kept to a minimum in Scotland. It should be optimised so that consumers will not pay any more than they have to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In England, consumers have paid through the nose. They have paid for capital expenditure through revenue, whereas if they had been sensible, as we have been in Scotland, they could have had the same infrastructure development but at a sensible pace that the customer could afford. I repeat that in terms of cost-per-unit of water delivered, Scotland is far more efficient than England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not necessarily disagree with the hon. Member about that. We may be more efficient in Scotland, but that does not mean that we cannot improve efficiency further, bearing in mind the significant capital expenditure that must be incurred in the future. I keep coming back to that because it is a major factor that Opposition Members like quietly to gloss over. They do not want to tell the people who they are trying to persuade to participate in referendums that they will have to pay higher water charges whatever happens.

The Government are trying to ensure that water services are provided and capital expenditure is raised at the least possible cost to the consumer. That is basic Conservative policy. It may be totally alien to the Labour party, but it is unfortunately a fact of life that such capital expenditure is required.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman cannot keep a straight face.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to see the hon. Gentleman looking so happy, because he was looking so serious earlier. I hope that I have brought a little cheer to the debate. Hon. Members were getting overheated and over-emotional about an issue that is very important to the electorate of Scotland and which should be treated seriously and with professionalism. We should take a business approach to ensure that we have an organisation that works in the best interests of the people of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman keeps saying that we have one, but he fails to accept that we are changing local government structure so the existing set-up cannot continue. We must also ensure that we raise the extra capital expenditure. I believe that the best way to achieve that is to have larger rather than smaller authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister was kind enough to have a meeting with me and members of the Scottish Landowners Federation, with whom I have had lengthy discussions. It is concerned that rural consumers should be protected. Although it is worried about the number of authorities, that is not one of its prime concerns. It wants the best delivery of service at the least cost,. I believe that these Government's proposals stand the best chance of achieving that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirk wood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw your attention, Sir James, to the fact that I have tabled 46 amendments in this group—I was disappointed that I was unable to make it 54 so that I could beat the hon. member for Linlithgow who puts 53 questions in an earlier sitting. I know that I cannot move them. They argue for special consideration to be given to the islands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened to the case that was made by the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside. It may come as a shock to him, but I agree with some of what he said. I should like to step back and consider the principal amendment No. 553, moved by the hon. Member for Hamilton. It is a useful amendment because it is based on the existing authorities. It is right to start with where we are now. I have not heard any sustained criticism of the present system for the delivery of water and sewerage services. I shall come back to the question of capital investment in a minute because it is relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current system is not deficient. It will need to be reconstructed: we are moving to a unitary system of authorities so there will have to be changes. I think that that is accepted—certainly by me. The Committee must
	<span class='label label-info column'>1522</span>
ask itself: if the present system is working, what are the minimal changes required in order to get from where we are now to where we shall need to be on 1 April 1996? The answer to that is reasonably simply. I am happy to move to larger authorities, as the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside suggested, and I am happy to consider the number of boards—there could be three, four, two or any number; it is a question of judgment. What I cannot accept however, and what I am very nervous about is the direction that the Government have taken by removing water services from public control. That is a key question and I suspect that there is a difference of opinion between us. The hon. Gentleman said that services would be more efficient if they were delivered by quangoisation. I might even be persuaded about that, except for the Quayle-Monroe report, which is very important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I was explaining to Mr. Martin how the procedural motion had arrived before the Committee. In an unaccustomed mood of wanting to protect people who do not need protection, I was perhaps wrong when I explained how the motion came about and the ingenuity with which it was discovered. Those who negotiated such a unique procedural device with the Clerks were my hon. Friends the Members for Jarrow (Mr. Dixon) and for Paisley, South. If I have learnt nothing else in my 15 years in the House, I have learnt that it is not productive to deny the Whips credit when massive credit is due. I pay tribute to their ingenuity in finding a means by which the Committee could discuss the procedural motion. I know that every member of the Committee, especially those on the Government Benches who prolonged the debate, will want to pay a fitting tribute to my two hon. Friends in the Labour Whips Office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All I can say is that "massive credit" is the adjective and term that I would use when referring to the hon. Members for Jarrow and for Paisley, South.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am touched by that small token of recognition. The one thing that gets me is that the Minister constantly refers to the hon. Member for Hamilton when he leaves the Room, but never mentions me when I do that. That is not right. I am getting a complex about it because I deserve the same treatment as the hon. Member for Hamilton.

I now return to the 46 amendments in my name. Before the Division in the House, I referred to the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0843">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1523</span>
interesting speech made by the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside. He perfectly properly accused Opposition Members of using an element of scare-mongering in their arguments. As the Minister said, the menu does not contain full-blown privatisation. I would have accepted that argument, but for the Quayle-Monroe report, which was paid for by taxpayers' money and undertaken by the Government. It was a substantial piece of work, but the Government refused to release the report from the merchant bankers Quayle-Monroe. I can only conclude that the suppression of the report reflects a lack of confidence in its detailed findings. The Minister shakes his head energetically. If those on the Government Front Bench can say something that will set my mind at rest, I undertake to reconsider my position on whether there has been scaremongering. However, until I see the conclusions of the Quayle-Monroe report, I shall continue to hold my view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When one employs consultants to consider options and configurations, which involve significant financial calculations and a great deal of commercially sensitive information that could be pertinent to raising capital, does the hon. Gentleman think such hypotheses should be made public?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirk wood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that argument, but reject it. Reports that are commissioned at taxpayers expense should be made available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would go along with the hon. Gentleman to an extent. If ministerial advisers decided to do a calculation or make a selection from a range of options—presumable options were canvassed in the Quayle-Monroe report—and make it available to Ministers, I understand that there should be protection. The information is confidential and Ministers should expect to receive it in confidence. In principle, a piece of work should be in the public domain to inform public argument if taxpayers money has been used to commission it. If people are being asked to provide commercially sensitive information in that context, the brief given to Quayle-Monroe was wrong and the price that the Government have paid is the fuelling of suspicions in the minds of people such as me. I was prepared to examine objectively the question of what the Government's long-term agenda is, but shall remain suspicious until I read the detail of the report. It would be helpful if the Minister could comment on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not convinced about the protection against disconnections that the Government say is built into the Bill. How does the Minister think that the new water authorities can be prevented from engaging in contracts with new suppliers which do not give them the remedy of cutting off supplies if they are not paid for the delivery of services? If the Government said they could not disconnect, the new water authorities could go to the European authorities with at least an arguable case that they were entitled to withdraw their services if they did not receive proper payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be happy to be told that I am wrong, but need chapter and verse about what is in the Bill to guarantee that such a thing will not happen. I would be interested to hear the Minister's comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no legislation permitting domestic disconnection of water supplies in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is true only because the water authorities cannot gain ready access to cut-off points. If the Minister can give a considered response to the detail of the Bill that gives an guarantee that disconnections cannot happen and that the European Court cannot be involved in the matter, I would be interested to hear it.

The hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside properly discussed the question of costs. I agree with him to a great extent. Everyone understands that a great deal of the necessary capital investment is required because of a lack of investment in the past. We could argue about who is responsible for that, but capital investment will be necessary to secure the supply and to bring sewage treatment up to the standard that Europe exacts from us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the reductions in standards that have now been set by Europe have helped us considerably. The ridiculously high scientific standards for clean effluent that the European Union originally set for itself were unrealistic. I am a pharmacist in my spare time—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, I was a pharmacist in a previous incarnation. The scientific requirements were once ludicrously high and standards have now rightly been relaxed. I would be happy to leave it to the common sense of the people who provide our water and treat sewage to make judgments about those standards and to put the meeting of them in their competent hands. Nevertheless, there will be costs involved in capital expenditure. I must ask the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside how the source of that money will make a difference. Why cannot one leave joint boards largely as they are? Perhaps there could be bigger amalgamations and conglomerations to deliver the service, but the joint boards should have the access to raise the money on the public markets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I canot understand what the difference would be between the Government's proposed quangos and joint committees being given an expressed power to raise money in the markets. I cannot understand how the Government's proposal would be cheaper or why the joint committees would be less efficient. It would mean minimum disruption and would obviate people's suspicion that quangos are the first step towards privatisation. I do not understand why the arguments about cost and efficiency cannot be dealt with under the existing system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have not made a case for their proposals. Of course there would need to be changes, but for the reasons that I have given and, wjth the minimum amount of change, one could move towards working with the new unitary authorities after 1 April 1996. Those authorities, could be given additional powers to raise the required capital through joint boards or joint committees. That proposal would retain the best of the current system, in terms of public accountability, and would bypass the problems of long-term privatisation. That would seem to me to be the natural, straight-

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know, but the problems of bringing in high-powered people is that they have high-powered salaries, share options and pension plans.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes—a typical liberal. I am sympathetic to some changes to get a new water system. The Government's proposal is indefensible and they have not made a case for proposing such a degree of change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the issue of decommissioning and just so that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful and I promise that that will be my bedtime reading for the weekend. I shall look forward to returning to the argument on Tuesday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the true liberal spirit of reconciliation, I ask the Minister to study my 46 amendments. If I study section 6 of the 1980 Act, will he study my 46 amendments over the weekend? The amendments seek to achieve a simple thing: to study the provision of water and sewage treatment facilities for the islands. Irrespective of the intellectual arguments that we are trading across the Committee and irrespective of whatever system one uses, the Government's proposals to patch up the current system to include Orkney and Shetland and the Western Isles make no sense. There is an incontrovertible case for leaving them alone and out of the picture. That would not cost the Government anything. I hope that the Government will give serious consideration to that point.

The Government should be able to accept the amendments because they are technically competent and are not deficient. If the Minister cannot accept the amendments in their collective glory, I hope that he could at least indicate that he was prepared to accept their spirit and introduce technical amendments of his own later, which would achieve the same end.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
