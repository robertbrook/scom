	<div class='title'>Scottish Grand Committee</div> <!-- title -->
	<time>Tuesday 18 January 1994</time>
	<p>[MR. MICHAEL J. MARTIN 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='legislation'>The Economy in Scotland</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Salmond 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Banff and Buchan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. One of the reasons why the Scottish Grand Committee is meeting again today to discuss the economy is that several hon. Members did not get the chance to speak at our previous sitting. If today's motion were identical to that discussed at our previous sitting, no member of the Committee could have spoken twice without your permission or that of the House. The motion that we are about to discuss today is slightly different from the motion that we discussed previously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would it be in order, Mr. Martin, for hon. Members who spoke at our previous sitting not to seek to catch your eye, so that members of the Committee who did not speak at that sitting will have the chance to do so today? I refer especially to the Front-Bench spokesmen, whose speeches took one hour and 20 minutes out of the previous two-and-a-half hour debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a matter for the Chair who is called to speak to the Committee. Let us leave it at that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. This is a welcome opportunity to continue our discussion as the deep problems of the Scottish economy need more airing. I wish to impress on you, Mr. Martin, however, that some hon. Members on the Opposition Front Bench will not be seeking to catch your eye although, technically, they might be entitled to do so. Indeed, two of my hon. Friends on the Opposition Front Bench who were not called to speak at the previous occasion will wish to do so today, and I hope that they will make a valuable contribution to our debate on the Scottish economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.31 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the matter of the economy in Scotland.</p></q>
I shall be opening the debate, Mr. Martin, and my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro), the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, hopes to catch your eye towards the end of our debate. Neither of us spoke during the previous sitting of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to thank Opposition Members for giving us another opportunity to debate the Scottish economy. If the motion is not accepted at the end of our proceedings, I shall be happy to meet again, again and again to discuss the Scottish economy. It is clear that one sitting of the Committee was not enough to satisfy the natural desires of Opposition Members to hear good-news stories about the Scottish economy. I am only too happy to meet those desires this morning, as there has been no shortage of such stories since the Committee met in December.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2</span>
In his remarks at the beginning of our previous debate, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State reviewed the general performance of the Scottish economy and emphasised some of its particular strengths. I shall not repeat what he said, although I hope to elaborate on some of the points that he made as well as highlight what has happened since our previous sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the outset, my right hon. Friend noted that independent economic forecasters—not the Government—were predicting continued gross domestic product growth for Scotland. I am delighted to say that the figures published since our previous debate not only bear out but enhance considerably the predictions of the independent forecasters. Provisional income-based estimates of GDP for 1992 have been published, and they show growth of 2 per cent. in Scottish GDP between 1991 and 1992 compared with a fall in the United Kingdom at a time of international recession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, for the third year in succession, the performance of Scottish GDP has been better than that of the United Kingdom as a whole. Excluding the UK continental shelf, our share of total GDP has increased steadily. It is generally accepted that estimates of GDP per head are the best indicator of trends in relative prosperity. Scottish performance in that respect has been most positive. Recent figures show an increase in Scottish GDP per head as a percentage of the UK figure in every year since 1989. Scotland's GDP performance during the recession has been very strong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Rachel Squire 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dunfermline, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How can the Minister talk about an improvement in the Scottish GDP and its economy when the Rosyth dockyard training centre, which used to train half of Scotland's manufacturing apprentices, took on only 25 apprentices in the past year? How does that marry with his claim that the Scottish economy is improving?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not the only one to claim that the Scottish economy is improving; I have cited people who are not associated with the Government. The hon. Lady spoke about training. No Government have such a comprehensive training scheme as ours. Our youth training guarantee is not replicated anywhere else in the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Naturally enough, the improvements in the Scottish economy are strongly reflected in the labour market. A further fall of 2,800 in the seasonally-adjusted unemployed figure for Scotland occurred in December. That was the fifth consecutive reduction in the seasonally-adjusted figure, which has fallen by nearly 13,000 since July. Scotland still has a seasonally-adjusted rate below that of the UK average, which is an encouraging trend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to see that the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) is leaving—no, he is talking to the press. He is in the process of issuing only his third press release of the day. I was about to refer to the hon. Gentleman, so I hope that he does not leave the Room. However, he is obviously engrossed and cannot hear that I am referring to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister checked whether the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) has issued a press release that begins, "Speaking in the Scottish Grand Committee today"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0031">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>3</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that my hon. Friend has not issued a press release, but I am sure that he will be keen to catch your eye, Mr. Martin, to tell the Committee about the effect of the Government's excellent policies on the economy in his area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am still waiting for the hon. Member for Fife, Central to rejoin our deate, but he obviously has other commitments. He is not listening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Neither is anyone else!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) obviously is listening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is being as entertaining as ever, but I wish to raise a serious matter relating to the Scottish economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will be familiar with the reorganisation of British Gas, which could cost thousands of jobs in Scotland. I became aware of those plans a few months ago and met senior management at British Gas. I argued that two of the new business units should be located in Scotland. I understand that the hon. Member for Fife, Central is meeting British Gas later today to ask that one of those new business units should be headquartered in Scotland. Do the Government have a policy on how many of the new British Gas business units should have their headquarters in Scotland, which supplies the bulk of that company's natural resources? If so, when will the Minister meet British Gas senior management to communicate that policy to the company?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intended to meet British Gas last week. I was unable to do so, which was my fault and not its. I am interested to learn what the implications of the restructuring proposals are for Scotland. They have not been spelt out in detail, for which I am not criticising British Gas. It is British Gas's decision, but we are inquiring whether it intends to site any businesses in Scotland. I cannot answer for the representations that the hon. Member for Fife, Central will make to British Gas today-it appears that he has already left the Room to make them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now deal with the unemployment figures and the press release put out by the hon. Member for Fife, Central, with, no doubt, the full approval of the hon. Member for Hamilton. That press release, which was issued last Thursday, said that a sinister matter had to be resolved: the discrepancy between the monthly claimant unemployment figures and the International Labour Organisation figures. In the press release he asked me to respond to the revelations about the figures which we were "too scared to publish". I am sure that the hon. Member knows where the House of Commons Library is—he often refers to it. The figures are published in the labour force survey press notice, the quarterly bulletin and the 	<i>Employment Gazette.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the Minister finds our press release so interesting, especially as it exposes the truth about mass unemployment in Scotland. Does he agree that one can find, in various Government documents, British figures for labour force survey projections, including the ILO count? Is he willing to give me the official document containing the regional breakdown? Are such documents published every quarter, along with the British labour force surveys?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am astonished that such a hard-working Opposition Front-Bench spokesman who has been in the job for some time has apparently never heard of the labour force survey quarterly bulletin or the monthly 	<i>Employment Gazette,</i> which published the figures. I have the most recent copy with me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Give the figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am about to give the hon. Member the figures. The differences between the two figures were fully spelt out in the 	<i>Employment Gazette</i> last October, I shall give the hon. Member the most recent figure for Scotland, which he is most keen to hear. Page 463 shows that the claimant unemployed figure was 248,000. The hon. Member does not like that figure; he prefers the ILO-based figure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to bore the Committee, but the Minister has missed an essential point. The Government are willing to publish the ILQ figure, which is not too dissimilar to the claimant count figure that they publish monthly. They do not provide, within the ILO count, the non-claimant element—the figure of 103,000 that featured prominently in our press release. The Government do not publish every quarter or every month the ILO claimant count figure with a separate definition of the non-claimant element. The figure of 103,000, added to the six-month figure of 250,000, gives a total of nearly 350,000. That is the issue. The Minister is being disingenuous in suggesting that the Government publish the figure to which I refer—they simply do not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is wholly wrong. We publish the ILO figure and I was about to give it to him, as he had asked me for it. It is in the 	<i>Employment Gazette:</i> I imagine the hon. Gentleman has heard of that publication. The claimant unemployed figure was 248,000. The ILO figure to which he attaches importance—I do not dispute that importance—was, at 246,000, actually lower than the unemployed claimant figure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am explaining the matter to the hon. Gentleman. Unlike him, I have read the 	<i>Employment Gazette.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I appreciate that, with his busy schedule, the Minister does not understand what he is talking about, but is it right for him, despite my explanation, repeatedly to mislead the Committee on the present ILO definition?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No member of the Committee would mislead the Committee, and I am quite sure that the Minister would not do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not in any way misleading the Committee. I am simply quoting the official figures that the hon. Gentleman says are unpublished. He said that the figures are private; in fact they are published. Of course, there is a difference of definition in two respects. There are currently about one million people who are unemployed according to the ILO definition but who are not included in the count of those claiming unemployment-related benefit, but there is a roughly equivalent number of unemployed

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I have given way two or three times to the hon. Gentleman. It is absolutely clear and is all spelt out in the article, to which I refer him. His charge is that the figures are unpublished and private—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ah—unpublished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to tell the hon. Gentleman that I have publication after publication here with the figures in them.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Is the Minister giving way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am not. I have given way several times. I commend to the hon. Member for Fife, Central the publications to which I have referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The figure cannot be found in the document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can find it; I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman cannot. Perhaps he should read the whole document before he makes such an absurd allegation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to be helpful. The Minister said that roughly one million people are unemployed claimants but are not classified as unemployed according to the ILO definition. Is he saying that the Government are paying unemployment benefit to about one million people who are not unemployed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I am glad to be able to reassure the hon. Gentleman on that point. I have already spelt out the differences between the two definitions. If hon. Members want a more detailed explanation of the exact basis for the two figures, I refer them to publications that are freely available in the Library, which explain the matter. The hon. Member for Fife, Central should not allege that figures are not published when they clearly are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have quoted the figures to the learned Gentleman again and again from official publications.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: rose—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should really make progress, but as the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) is obviously being his amiable self, I shall give way to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not being my amiable self. I am fed up with this arid statistical ping-pong. Regardless of whether the number of unemployed people in my constituency is 4,000 or 5,000, they are out of work and in desperate poverty. Will the Minister stop talking gobbledy gook and tell us what the Government are going to do to help them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman is not his customary amiable self. I received a request, via a press release, to respond to the revelations made by the hon. Member for Fife, Central and I took the first opportunity to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley is correct: unemployment is a serious problem. The Government do not dispute that. Against a background of 18 million unemployed people within the European Union, however, Scotland is doing relatively well, and we have a range of measures in place to help unemployed people—the most substantial programme ever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of those funds are channelled through the enterprise network, enabling it to continue to make a strong contribution to the economy through ambitious schemes for economic and environmental development. Local authorities—in many instances, Labour local authorities—have made a valuable contribution to many of those schemes, of which north Lanarkshire is an example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike Watson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, £450 million will be channelled to Scottish Enterprise and, through it, to local enterprise companies in 1994–95. Will the Minister comment on last year's survey, which appeared in 	<i>Scotland on Sunday,</i> in which 100 leading business people in Scotland were asked what they thought of Scottish Enterprise? Only 30 per cent. thought that it was more effective than the Scottish Development Agency, only 20 per cent. thought that it was giving value for money, only 27 per cent. thought that the support being given to local businesses was fair and effective and only 28 per cent. were satisfied with the make up of the LEC boards, particularly in relation to accountability. What has the Minister to say about that? The sum of £450 million is at stake, and the captains of industry in Scotland have so little faith in the schemes. What will the Minister do to deal with those problems?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are all sorts of surveys of opinion, which must all be treated with a certain amount of caution. Of course, we set out strategic guidance for Scottish Enterprise and we look to it to develop what it has achieved so far. We look to the network to seize the opportunities offered by the economic recovery—it cannot be denied that that is under way—to turn those opportunities into sustainable growth, jobs and competitiveness. No one ever says that any organisation is perfect, and the Opposition are entitled to their criticism of Government policy, but I hope that they will pay tribute to the considerable achievements of the Scottish Enterprise network at local and national level. As I said, in many cases those achievements were attained in partnership with local authorities, often Labour-held authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The emphasis on training will be on upgrading the skills of our work force. With reference to the question asked by the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, we are encouraging enterprise bodies to increase the numbers achieving Scottish vocational qualifications, to increase the number of young people having employed status in training and to improve links between business and the education sector. They will continue to take account of those with special needs and ensure that the Government's youth training guarantee is met.

We must focus on wealth creation through improving the performance of Scotland's company base. I emphasise as a focus of policy that small and medium-sized

indigenous Scottish companies will have a particularly important role to play, not least as a source of job creation. The support that Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise can offer them will be a catalyst to their success. Scottish Enterprise's new strategy to improve the business birth rate will be important. It will also acquire additional responsibility for inward investment because of the switch of resources from the new towns to Scottish Enterprise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to inward investment. I do not apologise for mentioning column 623 in yesterday's 	<i>Hansard,</i> which refers to Motorola. The Minister was justified in saying that the Scottish Office and Locate in Scotland played a major part in Motorola coming to Scotland. I learnt from the top Americans who run that company that one of the things that influenced its decision was the quick and flexible responses of Lothian region with regard to financial packages. As Lothian region will be unpicked Livingston development corporation is coming to an end, is the Scottish Office confident that those small local authorities, even by working with the Scottish Office, will have the speed of reaction that will bring companies such as Motorola to Scotland, when there are many other competitors in France, Spain and throughout the world? Does the Minister realise that there is a problem with the proposal to dismantle the new town arrangements and the big and successful regions, with their quick strategic planning?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that the hon. Gentleman is raising a genuine constituency matter, but a single-tier system of local government is likely to be positively helpful on inward investment, as there would be only one planning authority, rather than two. One of the strengths of the new towns, other than Glenrothes, is that they have been then-own planning authorities, albeit relatively small—certainly much smaller than in the regions. One of the great strengths of a single-tier system should be a faster planning and decision-making process. I confirm that the new authorities will continue to have the sort of industrial and economic power to which the hon. Member for Linlithgow referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the Minister's comment that local authorities will have the powers that are curently invested in the new towns corporation boards. What are his intentions for the asset base, which will be transferred to the new authorities? Will their income stream be sufficent to cover economic regeneration and development in those areas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that the new local authorities would have the sort of industrial and economic powers that existing local authorities have. What we envisage for the new town successor arrangements is what is perhaps best exemplified by what is already in place in Fife, such as Invest in Fife. I hope that similar effective arrangements that are being worked on in the hon. Gentleman's constitutency will follow. Invest in Fife is a partnership between the new town arrangements, Fife Enterprise and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
Fife regional council. It is fully operational and is an example of the co-operation that can exist to ensure the effective delivery of economic development services in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am fully aware of what is happening in Fife, but will the Minister tell us his plans for the four other new towns? In my constituency, £55 million of assets are to be sold off this year—that is the target set by the Scottish Office. The rate of sale will probably mean that very little of an asset base will be left to transfer to the new local authority under any partnership arrangement. Even if such an asset base exists, will the Minister give a commitment that the local enterprise companies will go into pertnership with any authority that is interested in such as arrangement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman is reasonably reassured by the reference to Fife, because that is a practical example of what has happened. Negotiations continue in relation to East Kilbride and I am not suggesting that what is appropriate for one new town is necessarily appropriate for another. The type of arrangement that we envisage certainly involves a partnership, with the lead role of inward investment and so on being taken by the local enterprise company. That is the focus of the enterprise network with the local authorities in partnership.

In relation to exports, one of the many action points in last year's White Paper, "Scotland in the Union: A Partnership for Good", was the Review of the operations of Scottish Trade International. Overseas trade, both within the single market and with the rest of the world, is a success story for Scotland. I hope that Opposition Members agree on that. However, we must take every chance to consolidate and extend that success. The Government must continually look critically for improvements in the services we provide to our existing and potential exporters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"Scotland in the Union" announced a review of the operation of Scottish Trade International, the joint organisation set up by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State with staff drawn from Scottish Enterprise and the Scottish Office Industry Department. That review team has now reported to my right hon. Friend and I am glad to say that it has validated the STI concept, but it said that output could be improved if the component parts of the organisation were more closely integrated. We fully accept that recommendation and we will take immediate steps to appoint a director of STI whose first main task will be to produce a plan for a structure, which will facilitate and optimise the talents of the whole organisation and the benefits that can be derived from connections between the different types of work that STI carries out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report of the review made a numer of detailed recommendations about the internal organisation and management of STI. We will charge the new director to look carefully at the report and to produce an operating plan which addresses the issues of internal integration and external co-ordination with other service providers. As part of that process, I would expect consultation with the Scottish Exports Forum, which was set up by the Secretary of State and which I chair. The forum membership represents other export service providers, such as local authorities, the Scottish Council for Development and Industry, Chambers of Commerce and local enterprise

companies. It also includes some of Scotland's best and most experienced exporters as well as representatives of successful firms in a range of manufacturing industries and financial services. The forum's advice will be invaluable in making sure that policies are rooted in practicality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Through the Scottish Exports Forum we shall consider the range of services supplied to exporters in Scotland by the public and private sectors to determine how they can best be co-ordinated to ensure the maximum effectiveness of our exporting efforts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Kynoch 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome everything that my hon. Friend the Minister said because it builds on the success of Scottish exports over the past few years. Scotland has produced better export figures in four out of the last five years recorded. Does he also agree that the policy he has outlined builds on the general current economic climate, which is favourable to exporters? Does he agree that there is every reason to expect Scottish exports to continue to increase in future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I hope that Opposition Members will be generous in paying tribute to the many Scottish companies and their work forces who have an excellent export record. We export more per head of the numbers employed in the United Kingdom than Japan or Germany. I am not offering a message of complacency. We can improve and the Government are concentrating on the full co-ordination of STI's activities and, more generally, the services supplied by the public and private sectors to small and medium-sized Scottish firms. A range of new developments have been established. For example, I was in the middle east in summer following the establishment of a scheme called "Scheme for Small Scottish Exporters to the Middle East". As the Committee may know, that initiative was warmly supported by the British-Arab chamber of commerce and a former Member of the House, Mr. Jim Sillars, was extremely helpful in boosting Scotland's cause for exports to the middle east.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that several hon. Members wish to contribute to the debate and I had originally intended to speak about one or two individual Scottish industries, notably North sea oil. As I have given way on several occasions, time is running out, so I shall briefly sum up my view of the Scottish economy at the start of 1994. I shall concentrate on the urban industrial sector and I hope that the Under-Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries will catch your eye, Mr. Martin, at the end of the debate, so that he may concentrate more on the rural economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, the Scottish economy is inextricably bound to that of the United Kingdom, so the success of the Government's policy at the United Kingdom level is fundamental to the success of the Scottish economy. What is in prospect—this is not the Government's political forecast but what independent commentators are saying-is that growth is now expected to be higher than previously predicted and still higher next year. Headline inflation is at its lowest level since the 1960s and the underlying rate is the lowest since the series was first compiled in 1975. In his Budget, the Chancellor has also taken action in relation to the public sector borrowing requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are on track for an economy in positive growth, with a low level of inflation. Essentially, that means that some of the Government's decisions, which have often been tough, are now paying off and the framework for success is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
unequivocally established. I hope that Opposition Members will agree that Scotland did not suffer to the same extent as other parts of the United Kingdom from the effects of the recession but that we are now reaping the benefits of recovery in common with other parts of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members are perfectly entitled to criticise those policies of the Government with which they disagree, but I hope that they will not go over the fine and go from making criticisms to talking Scotland down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am about to finish and I know that the hon. Gentleman does not talk Scotland down. It does no one any good to give the impression that the Scottish economy has not changed, is not dynamic and is not growing. The Scottish economy has changed, it is dynamic and it is growing but no one denies that there are problems. Currently, every nation in the western world, whatever the political complexion of its Government—left, right or centre—has economic problems. As I have said, between 17 million and 18 million people in the European Union, are unemployed. The Scottish economy, however, has changed for the better—a new Scotland now exists. Many new firms have been established, some of them Scottish-owned, some owned outside Scotland, which are becoming increasingly competitive in the international economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Scotland has a firm basis on which to build for the future and to continue the transformation of its economy. That is what the Government are about. I believe that the Scottish people appreciate and perceive the need to be internationally competitive. The figures suggest that we are succeeding in that aim. This year and in the years to follow, we are determined to continue to build on that success.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The health of the Scottish economy is determined by the Government's policies, past and present, and those that are yet to be enacted. The Government's attitude to the manufacturing, extractive and transport industries has laid the foundation for Scotland's economy. That has been coupled with the mishandling of the nation's finances and by blind, blinkered political bias and ideology. The Government's refusal to intervene or to develop partnership policies and their reliance on the market are having a devastating effect on the Scottish economy.

Scotland has lost major industries because of Government inactivity. The Scottish steel industry was lost because of the method of its privatisation. If the steel industry had been supported it would still exist. It was not protected from Japanese dumping of steel products, for example, the steel pipes for North Sea development. Nippon Steel purposely operates at overcapacity; it produces steel for its home market in huge, efficient mills that provide a surplus that it could afford to give away, if necessary. The United Kingdom market is not protected from such dumping.

No directives are given to the oil companies to coordinate future exploration and exploitation of the North Sea, so there are no orders to help suppliers and fabrication yards to plan production and employment. Instead, we are faced with the present hit-or-miss problems of pay offs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's comments on the tubes supplied by Nippon Steel. What was the composition of that steel? Could it have been made in Scotland, or was it a specific graded steel, the use of which was applicable only in that case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot use my time to talk about such technicalities, but I will have a chat with the hon. Gentleman later, because I know a bit about the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
British Steel walked out of some markets, partly because of unfair competition from elsewhere. Although they are a mere 100 miles from the 10th largest oilfield in the world, Scottish fabrication yards are struggling for work. Shipbuilders of both maritime and military vessels are in difficulties because of unfair competition from foreign subsidised yards and erratic orders from the Ministry of Defence. For example, the scrap-and-renew appeals for tax incentives made to the Government by British ship owners fall on deaf ears. Ours is an ageing fleet when compared with those of our European Community competitors who operate such an incentive policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The aeromanufacturing industry employs 8,200 people and is a high-skill and high-value-added industry. Rolls-Royce plc, which employs 4,000 people at Hillingdon and East Kilbride, together with British Aerospace at Prestwick, which is the largest manufacturing employer in Scotland, are pleading with the Government to stop unfair subsidies and practices in the world market. Those employers produce the best products that money can buy-but the Government dither.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should refer to the Rosyth dockyard fiasco, where the direct policy of the Government undermined the future of the largest employer in Fife. The efficiency and latest capital investment of that dockyard exceeds any other, yet the Government's double-talk and their display of illogical deceit exposes the future of that great Scottish asset. A U-turn in Government policy is needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the future privatisation of British Rail. What future? I draw attention to the Government's reluctance to electrify the Edinburgh—Aberdeen route and to renew track and rolling stock from the London to Glasgow west-coast route.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Privatisation will not help one iota in that respect. No capital expenditure will be invested in it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
The Government's rail policy does not augur well for an efficient rail network. The delay in developing the Mossend depot to service the channel tunnel connections has an effect on Scottish industrial competition, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to emphasise the Government's deplorable role in the fishing industry. Many rural, island and mainland communities depend on fishing and fish products. Foreign vessels are fishing in our waters, while Scottish boats are tied up. Thousands of tonnes of fish and fish products are imported into our market from aboard each year. The Government have placed no embargo or restraints on that trade. Foreign trawlers receive fuel tax benefits—our trawlers do not. What is that, if it is not unfair competition?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's loss on "Black Wednesday" of £50 billion has placed an economic millstone around the neck of Scotland. According to the Government, cuts in public expenditure is the answer. However, when our economy sadly and desperately needs a primer, the Government do the opposite. Money must be invested in social infrastructure to protect our future. Money that is available from EC funds must be taken up—funds that we continue to provide and pay for. We must invest in housing, new hospitals, sewers, roads, bridges, light railway and in transport improvements. That is a must for a modern economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are the Government putting builders back to work with suppliers? Are professionals receiving life-saving contracts? No. The Government say that we are in debt. The appeal by engineering employers for capital allowances to encourage investment in research, development and plant did not work. The Chancellor of the Exchequer ignored it. The savings that would result from such a policy in unemployment and social security benefits would be astronomical and the incomes derived from tax and insurance would be beneficial to the Exchequer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's ideological bias towards such issues results in money being squandered. Local government reform in Scotland will be a massive drain on the Scottish economy; it will cost millions of pounds. Even to promote, the trust status of hospitals and schools has cost thousands of pounds. Budgets could be ignored if a political benefit were to be gained from doing so. However, we should not be surprised by the actions of the Government. The defeat of the miners in the coal strike cost the country millions of pounds, but that was worthwhile for the Conservative Government because it was the start of their policy of defeating and discrediting organised labour and introducing low wages, part-time and sweated labour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is good for the Government is not always what is good for this country. The latest cuts and lay-offs in the banking and insurance industry, which affect many young school leavers and others—particularly in Midlothian—many of whom are highly qualified, are the result of the stagnation of the economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that the situation is as the Under-Secretary of State described. The Government must ask for and accept guidance from employers organisations, the Scottish Trades Union Congress, the CBI and others to produce policies to help growth, retain existing industries and expand job prospects. We should act in partnership, like our European competitors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government state that economic trends show a decrease in unemployment—I wrote this before the speech of the Under-Secretary of State—but I challenge their unemployment figures. The definition should be people

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
looking for work rather than people drawing benefits. My calculation of the number of people out of work in Scotland is 400,000. True unemployment—this will be of interest to you, Mr. Martin—in Springburn, Provan and Glasgow, Central is 25 per cent., or one in four. Since 1979, we have lost 360,000 manufacturing jobs. Unemployment benefits cost £2 billion per year in Scotland alone. That is the real issue. That is what we should have been discussing yesterday, instead of wasting our time arguing about the reorganisation of an already efficient local government. That should be the priority for the Scottish people. Go and tell the people who are unemployed that we are doing all right and everything is on the up. I do not believe that, and neither do they.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Member for Midlothian on an excellent speech.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A third of the time, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton rightly says—but he dealt with them succinctly, pertinently and with a knowledge and an understanding of Scottish industry that Ministers do not have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State talks about success: the success of Scottish industry and the Scottish economy. I think that it was my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton who commented to me during one of yesterday's many Divisions that he read in the 	<i>Daily Telegraph</i> that I am participating in the 	<i>Daily Telegraph</i> fantasy soccer league. That is the only way in which a Hearts supporter will ever win any league! The Minister and Conservative Members live in a fantasy world. Labour Members see the real world in our surgeries each weekend, we talk to people and see grinding unemployment and the poverty and despair that it causes. We know the reality of Scotland today. The fantasy world that Ministers live in is reflected in speech after speech in the House of Commons, but bears no relation to what is happening in Scotland—in Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley as well as elsewhere.

I know, Mr. Martin, that you know the Girvan travel-to-work area very well—you have visited it regularly and we are glad to see you there. Hull International recently closed there because of the downturn in the economy. The company said quite clearly that that closure was because of the recession caused by Government policy. Voltech, an electronics firm, has threatened to do the same. On Friday, I am going to talk to its managing director to find out if that closure can be averted. That is the reality of what is happening in Scotland, not the fantasy that we hear from Conservative Members. Unemployment is up in the Girvan travel-to-work area and in the Cumnock and Sanquhar travel-to-work area—I hope that the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Dumfries, knows that. There is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
high, grinding unemployment in his constituency in places such as Sanquhar and Kirkconnel, yet he does not lift a finger to do anything about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Ayr travel-to-work area, unemployment is going up. As we heard earlier, the hon. Member for Ayr often releases his speeches to the press before he makes them. Sometimes I think that he makes them before his mind is in gear. He received plea after plea from Wallacetown Engineering—not just from the work force but from management—asking him to fight against Government policy on energy and especially on pit closures. Wallacetown produces the switchgear for the mining industry. As sure as night follows day, when pits close, there is no market for mine engineering. Even the hon. Member for Ayr should have understood that, but he did not seem to. Wallacetown is now on short time work and redundancies are threatened because Conservative Members are not prepared to fight against Government policy. The Government's policies are causing those redundancies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for mentioning me in relation to Wallacetown. I am working with Wallacetown's management, but I have to be realistic when considering the coal industry. I am not prepared to raise false hopes in people—the hon. Gentleman is prepared to do so—when I can see that a natural decline is occurring in the coal industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Natural?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. There is a market element and Opposition Members must realise that. Rest assured that there are other ways of protecting Wallacetown.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman that interventions should be brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ayr tells people in Wallacetown that he is doing everything he can, but he comes to Parliament and votes against the interests of his constituents time after time. He says that there is a natural downturn in the coal industry, but the Government's energy policy is in no way natural. The dash for gas has been contrived by the Government and has undermined the coal industry. That has been said time after time, not just in this Committee but on the Floor of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another matter on which the hon. Member for Ayr talks about what he will do, but does very little. My hon. Friends the Members for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. McKelvey) for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) and for Qmninghame, South (Mr. Donohue) have been involved in the matter. It concerns Jetstream. In the previous sitting, I asked the Secretary of State whether he intended to do anything about Jetstream. He is a member of the Cabinet and has some power and authority. He is reported to be close to the Prime Minister; apparently he is one of the few Cabinet members who remains close to the Prime Minister. He could influence what happens to Jetstream.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian said, 2,600 people work for Jetstream. It took on apprentices last year. It is at the cutting edge of technology, not just in Scotland but in the whole of Britain. However, as a result of a downturn in the market, 630 jobs are under threat. The Government can do something about it. My hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun knows that we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0037">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
pleaded with the President of the Board of Trade to do something about the unfair competition and about speeding up the launch aid. We pleaded with the Ministry of Defence to consider placing orders with Jetstream and we pleaded with the Export Credits Guarantee Department to give more favourable terms. What have we received so far? Promises and Pledges. The hon. Member for Ayr says that something is being done, but month after month goes by and nothing is done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even more worrying reports have appeared in the 	<i>Financial Times</i> and 	<i>Flight International</i> suggesting that British Aerospace's corporate headquarters is negotiating a deal with Indonesia. My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) well knows that Indonesia does not have a nice regime—it illegally occupied East Timor and it persecutes its own people. British Aerospace is negotiating a deal to sellmore arms to Indonesia in return for allowing Indonesia to manufacture turbo prop airliners. Those airliners could only be Jetstream airliners exported from Scotland—that is an industry lost to Prestwick.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing is being done about that. The hon. Member for Ayr and the British Aerospace people shrug their shoulders and say that it is pure speculation, but Dr. Habibi, the head of the aerospace industry in Indonesia, has made it clear that that will happen. We need a categoric statement from British Aerospace that it will not sell out the Jetstream operation to the Indonesians. I hope that in his reply the Minister will make it clear that the Government are at least aware of the matter and that they will do something about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the last sitting, we were told that the electronics industry was the great white hope for Scotland. In reply to an intervention, the Secretary of State mentioned Digital. In my constituency, just outside Ayr, it is doing relatively well, although it is not without problems. What the Secretary of State did not mention is that right next door to Digital is Prestwick Circuits, which is in great difficulty. My hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, South (Mr. Donohoe) and I went to see the managing director of Prestwick Circuits, who is on his way out now because Prestwick Circuits is in great financial difficulty. When we approach such companies, they say that it is because of the Government's policies that they are in difficulty. So here we have evidence that an electronics company, supposedly at the forefront of expansion and development in Scotland, is in difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman define the problems that the Government have caused for Prestwick Circuits?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I keep hearing that it is a worldwide recession, but Conservatives tell me that, all over the world, countries are following the British example, following Thatcherism and privatising. They are following us, and perhaps that is causing the recession. Perhaps if they
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>

Member for Ayr, is that of Connor Peripheral, which wrote to the Government asking for assistance and was denied it. That goes against the wishes of the European Parliament. The hon.

The vice-president of Connor Peripheral has just written to me saying that the Government are not interested in the affairs of the electronics industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend providing a specific example to underline the general point that I was making. I have given examples from the industries on which we are told that the future economy of Scotland depends, and I point out the difficulties that exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I briefly make a plea? In Ayrshire, we need vital improvements in the infrastructure to ensure new investments in the area and easy access to the markets, not just in the rest of Scotland but in England and beyond. I am glad that the Minister who will be replying is the hon. Member for Dumfries, because I know that he has a particular interest in and sympathy for some of the matters that I shall raise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the vital link between the A77 and the M77 will now go ahead. I know that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) has been working hard on that, and I am grateful to him. I hope that we shall receive an assurance today that that vital infrastructure development will go ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, may I underline the importance of bypasses at Maybole, Girvan and New Cumnock? Yesterday, I was speaking to Chris Rouse, the general manager of Turnberry, which is to host the Open, golfs greatest event, sometimes called the British Open. It would be much more satisfactory if there was a bypass at Maybole and improved access. That is important for tourist development and the development of an area such as south Ayrshire, which, incidentally, will become less attractive to tourism if we get a power line there. I hope also that the Government will consider the vital link from Ayrshire to the M74.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only roads but railways are important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Dumfries and I used to make regular representations to Ministers of Transport about the "Paddy" and the future of the Dumfries line. I am very worried that the lines to Dumfries, the constituency of the Minister, and the lines to Stranraer, the area that the Secretary of State represents, will not be helped by privatisation; they will be harmed by the exercise. We need an assurance about those two lines as they are vital lifelines for the south-west of Scotland. That area is often ignored and will develop industrially only if those infrastructure links are maintained and improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Prestwick airport is another vital part of our infrastructure. The Minister and I had a head-to-head tussle about that and I accept that we are no longer competing with Glasgow for scheduled flights. However, there is often fog at Glasgow airport, and I am sure that everyone would agree that Prestwick is ideal for diversions and holiday charters. Consumer demand for the coming summer has already shown that. On this occasion, I am sure that the hon. Member for Ayr will agree with me that too many obstacles are being put in the way of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0038">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
development of Prestwick airport. I shall mention two on which I hope the Government will take action. British Airports Authority is being allowed to encourage diversions to Edinburgh, which is much more dangerous and less satisfactory than diversions to Prestwick. Secondly, and even more importantly, I must refer to the rail halt at Prestwick airport. I was unable to go to the start—or what we thought would be the start of that project, although I think that the hon. Member for Ayr was there. I understand that the work is not proceeding because British Rail is dragging its heels. I hope that the Government will act to ensure that that work is progressed as quickly as possible because Prestwick airport is vital to the future development of industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may have been a slip of the tongue, but I hope that my hon. Friend is not implying that Edinburgh airport is unsafe. I am sure that he did not mean to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what he said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I meant that Prestwick airport, with its long runway and its access over open fields and the sea, is relatively safer than Edinburgh for diverting wide-bodied jets. I am not saying that Edinburgh is unsafe, but that it is relatively safer and more convenient to divert aircraft to Prestwick. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) for giving me the opportunity to point that out. The promotion of Prestwick airport as an all-Ayrshire authority under the re-organisation of local government would be a much more effective way of keeping the matter before the Government and the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether Ministers ever get out and about or talk to people in Scotland. Do they realise what is happening? Do they ever see the despair or the poverty caused by unemployment? Does that ever stir their consciences, if they have any? They have the power to do something. We need change in the means of investment in industry to ensure that apprentices are taken on. We need public investment in our infrastructure—road, rail and air. We need change in public investment in training. Given the Minister's pathetic speech, I am certain that a change of Government is the only way to achieve such changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I start by congratulating the hon. Member for Midlothian on the way in which he addresses the matters to hand. I take issue with him on one or two counts, especially about Rosyth. He seemed very negative about it but the Government have changed their policy towards Rosyth. We lost Trident but I should have thought that many Opposition Members would have welcomed the loss of Scotland's long-standing nuclear involvement which so many of them deprecated. Rosyth won through—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will give way to the hon. Lady in a second. Rosyth won through with the promise of the surface fleet maintenance contracts. I believe that it is the job of every hon. Member in the Committee to ensure that the Government live up to their commitment to award those maintenance contracts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Squire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask the hon. Gentleman two questions. When he disputes about the lack success of the Government's policy on Rosyth, will he explain how he can
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
align that with the fact that the dockyard has already lost more jobs than were predicted would be lost by the year 2000? Will he also comment on how the privatisation of the dockyard will be of any benefit to the defence industry, particularly in relation to manufacturing? Are not the Government stepping back to watch Rosyth dockyard slowly slip away into the Forth and sink?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unlike Opposition Members, I shall try to respond to each point raised by the hon. Lady.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I was very familiar with the circumstances in 1987 when there was talk about introducing private management for the Rosyth dockyard. At that time, everyone in the area was totally against it because they thought that it would bring about the death of Rosyth. Instead, it brought about a revitalisation that seems to have been accepted by the unions, the work force and the management. The widening of Rosyth's horizons has allowed it to expand into other activities at a time—to answer the second question of the hon. Member for Dunfermline, West (Ms Squire)—when defence spending in the United Kingdom is being reduced. Obviously, such a reduction in defence expenditure will have an effect on Rosyth. Again, Opposition Members have advocated such a reduction in defence spending for years. The effect on Rosyth is one of the unfortunate by-products of then-argument. That effect could have been anticipated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Midlothian referred to banking, but he forgot to mention the massive technological change that has occurred in that industry. Every man, woman and child in Scotland recognises that transactions no longer involve people; they involve machinery. That has had an effect on the banking sector. I have a personal interest in the matter because I have a son who works for the Bank of Scotland, so, like any other father, I am concerned for him. We must wait to see what happens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Midlothian has missed the point, however, because jobs in banking have been transferred to computer manufacturing and the maintenance and design of computer equipment. The hon. Gentleman should bear that in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been given the chance to speak on the Scottish economy, so I should show some grace to the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley. I understand that it was the hon. Gentleman's efforts that brought about today's continued debate and I thank him for that. It is not often that he achieves a lot in the House but, on this occasion, he has achieved something.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from giving other hon. Members a chance to speak, I doubt whether the debate will do much good for the Scottish economy. During the previous Committee sitting, I listened to the pessimistic remarks and downtalking of the hon. Member for Hamilton. He opened his remarks by saying that no one was interested in talking down the Scottish economy and those who are making an effort. Thereafter, he drew on a script that did just that, as a reading of 	<i>Hansard</i> will show. On that ocassion the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) made a positive contribution, at least in part. He spoke about the importance of signing the GATT agreement, which has since been achieved I hope that it brings great benefits to Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hamilton paid much attention to Europe, pointing in particular to the efforts of Jacques Delors to secure employment. He seemed to think that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0039">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
everything that happens in Europe is good and that everything that happens here is awful. The hon. Gentleman should remember that, unlike all other countries in Europe, Scotland and the United Kingdom have enjoyed a continued fall in unemployment levels in recent months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel obliged to speak about the latest available unemployment figures for my constituency. The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley suggested that we suffer excessive level of unemployment. I agree with him that an unemployed person who wants to work is a wasted resource, which I deplore. In the real world, however, my figures show that the Ayr travel-to-work area is doing well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that problems could lie ahead. Staff are currently being laid off at British Aerospace. I am grateful for the help that I have received from my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and to the Department of Trade and Industry for its detailed and helpful attitude to British Aerospace and the Jetstream project. The lack of a level playing field in the world market needs to be addressed. My understanding is that such matters are being dealt with positively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman keeps talking about the sympathy and understanding that he receives from Ministers. Has he seen the written replies that I received yesterday from the Secretary of State for Defence and the President of the Board of Trade. They said that no future assistance will be offered to the Jetstream project. We receive much sympathy, but no action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that, once again, we are offered action through direct discussion with the management at Jetstream, which appreciates that. If the hon. Gentleman became involved in the workings of the Jetstream project, he might understand that short-term solutions to the problems cannot be achieved. The long-term success of the Jetstream project at Prestwick can be achieved. That must be the aim of all the hon. Members representing Ayrshire. That is certainly the objective of senior management at British Aerospace and the management and the workforce behind Jetstream, who work together. It is wrong to suggest that orders will suddenly pour in from a stagnant market place and that the Government can somehow induce companies from outside the United Kingdom to make purchases. Orders may, however, be just over the horizon. I know that we shall have to wait and see, but I feel that we shall get good news in the not-too-distant future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The unemployment rate in my constituency stands at 9 per cent.; it is 22 per cent. in the constituency of the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley. That hon. Gentleman has been a Member of the House of Commons for many years, so the hon. Member for the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) should not ask me about resigning but his hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The news is not all bad. Jetstream may be suffering from a stagnant world market, but Aviall, the former Caledonian Air Motiv, which had about 100 employees 10 years ago, now has about 900. The company overhauls major air engines and is now a world leader. By Jove, it deserves to be talked up. It is doing what is needed-creating high-tech, high-skilled work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our previous debates we heard about the difficulties created by the Budget. I believe that the Budget was quite uncharacteristic of a Tory Government. People believe that, under a Tory Government, they will have more cash in their pockets, but the Budget reversed that belief. The Government have taken a long-term view however, and turned their policies round to drive down tax demands. That policy may be uncharacteristic, but it provides some help for business in Scotland. As the hon. Member for Gordon suggested in the previous sitting, many policies were made to help both in the long and the short term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps my hon. Friend the Minister will refer to small business interests in Scotland. Firms that sub-contract to major companies will now be protected through the early payment of their bills. Small businesses throughout the United Kingdom have pressed for that. That protection was promised in the Budget and I look forward to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Budget contained two specific references to a capital commitment, particularly to Ayrshire. Once again, I can indentify with the comments of the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley on the requirement to improve the local infrastucture. I appreciate the efforts of the Under-Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West in trying to secure the A77-M77 link. I, too, look for an early statement that that link will finally be put out to tender and that contracts will be placed and work started. The link is a vital component in Ayrshire's transport system. It will give considerable assistance to the constituency of the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley solving some of its horrific unemployment problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new traffic control centre in Prestwick will bring construction jobs to Ayrshire and secure existing jobs in air traffic control at Atlantic House. Everyone in west Scotland will welcome an injection of cash into the west coast railway line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another feature of the November Budget was the stated intention to impose an air passenger duty tax—another measure designed to collect more cash. I have suggested to the Chancellor that that tax should exempt 60-seat aircraft, the size of aircraft that sometimes service the Western Isles. I believe that my hon. Friend the Under Secretary, too, has made representations on that issue. Extending the range from 20 to 60 passengers would help not only people in the Western Isles but activities connected with the Jetstream project. Other Members representing Ayrshire should take that on board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
Kilmarnock and Loudon was not there. The hon. Gentleman mentioned about the size of aircraft and I stated quite clearly that I had written to the Chancellor about it. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman's memory is failing. Perhaps his confused state last night explains that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a great responsibility to our people in Scotland, our constituents and the work force. An instance has been brought to my attention verbally—unfortunately, I have no hard copy at present. I hope to be able to provide that, but on that basis I shall name no names and I shall ask my hon. Friend the Minister whether he believes there to be substance to the charge I will outline. The chance to build a brand-new factory in central Scotland to manufacture contact lenses, which could have provided some 400 jobs, was lost because of the activities of one hon. Member who deprecated the efforts of the company concerned. If that is true, it is shameful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman should be very careful about making any allegations about an hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin, for that judgment. In that case, would it be in order to ask my hon. Friend the Minister to confirm or deny that consultations were taking place between an enterprise company—a company with an external base—and locate in Scotland to bring a manufacturing plant to Scotland which would have made contact lenses. If that is the case, and that chance has been lost, can my hon. Friend the Minister give any reason why that happened?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Quite honestly, I was the victim of just such an incident in the Chamber yesterday at the hands of the hon. Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson).

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The latter part of the speech of the hon. Member for Ayr was disgraceful. Such innuendo without factual substantiation almost borders on sleaze. It was uncharacteristic of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
hon. Gentleman and I hope that we shall not witness similar behaviour in future. If such allegations are made, there are ways of taking them up but to make them anonymously is quite ridiculous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to take up a couple of the remarks made by the Under-Secretary at the beginning of his comments. Although I share much of the anger shown by the Opposition, I shall try to be as constructive as possible in the circumstances and look to the future. The hon. Gentleman referred to relative recent changes in GDP. Like him, I read the statistics and it is clear to me that Scotland has been doing better in terms of GDP in recent years, but I am concerned about some figures cited in 	<i>Economic Trends</i> in the past few weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<i>Economic Trends</i> for December 1993 looked at GDP by region at factor cost and the discrepancies that are beginning to emerge in the Scottish regions are worrying. If the Minister cannot do so this morning, will he undertake to look at those emerging disparities? 	<i>Economic Trends</i> publication No. 482 of December 1993 showed that the GDP for the borders at a United Kingdom factor rate equalling 100 was only 81·5. The Scottish figure as a whole is 95·8.1 congratulate the best performing regions and do not want to hold them back, especially Grampian, which has a rating of 134·8 and Lothian, which has one of 110·5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An oil-related factor is obviously behind the Grampian success, just as a financial services factor is behind the Lothian success. I understand that and good luck to them, but the Government have responsibility to consider the big discrepancy between the relative prosperity of the regions. The Minister who will respond to the debate has an interest in the matter as well, because Dumfries and Galloway comes with a rating of only 86·6.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are right to point to the relative increases in GDP that have occurred in recent years, but differences are emerging region by region in Scotland and the trends are not favourable. The Government have a duty to consider that matter and I hope that that point will be taken to heart.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary made an announcement about Scottish Trade International and I welcome it for what it is. The integration that he suggested demonstrates that the way in which the Government have decided to proceed is positive, but much more could be done to assist export efforts. Much has been done and I accept that the work that has been performed by Scottish Enterprise under the Scottish export assistance scheme is extremely valuable. I suggest that some of the terms of that scheme might be improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme reimburses up to 50 per cent. of export marketing plans, with a maximum of £30,000 which can be paid over two years, subject always to the availability of funds. Scottish Enterprise takes a return of a 5 per cent. royalty on future sales from any assistance that it gives and there is a ceiling of twice the level of assistance granted which it can claw back. Welcome though the scheme is, it penalises success to an extent because those successful firms which take advantage of that facility and make progress in export markets have to pay for the privilege through the royalty. That money goes back into the scheme and can be used again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ceiling of twice the level of assistance granted should be reduced by half, or by something that would enable companies to benefit more from the scheme than is currently possible. I know that if the companies' export
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0041">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
plans are not successful, the costs can be written off and translated into a grant, which is welcome. Much can be done to build on the Scottish export assistance scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister is aware that there are equivalents to Scottish Trade International in other parts of the world. I have been examining an interesting scheme in Canada run by British Colombia Trade—an equivalent organisation to Scottish Enterprise and Scottish Trade International. That scheme gives the type of assistance that is unavailable to companies in Scotland. It has adopted a one-stop shop approach and it operates more flexibly than schemes available to our companies. It offers rather advantageous and attractive financial terms, especially to small companies. They receive preferential support if they trade overseas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that Scottish Enterprise and the Department of Trade and Industry will monitor such scheme to see whether lessons can be learnt from what happens in other countries and to ensure that the rules of international trade are not breached. Abuses of the trade rules are inimical to the interests of UK companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister use his influence with the DTI to make an early announcement on what is to replace the much-welcomed export initiative scheme operated by the DTI. I understand that it will finish at the end of the financial year 1993–94. Will there be a replacement on 1 April 1994 that Scottish companies can use? I hope that in any transitional period the facilities afforded by the export initiative will be continued. Some companies are apprehensive that the scheme will be changed or reduced in its effectiveness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Borders local enterprise company does a great deal to assist the export effort from the Borders. Scottish Enterprise supports its export development programme. It receives a relatively good financial settlement, although it could always use more. Small firms are being taken through intensive export planning processes, which will help the Border export effort. The export assistance scheme, organised at Scottish Enterprise, is most welcome and needs to be improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One or two other things could be done to help the export initiative. I agree with the hon. Member for Ayr that smaller manufacturing companies need help. My hon. Friend the Member for Gordon also referred to that. Smaller manufacturing firms struggle with export marketing intelligence—it is expensive data to get hold of and to keep current. For example, a knitwear manufacturer in Jedburgh and Hawick would need help in interpreting the trends and working out the significance of marketing intelligence. The Government could do more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the British Overseas Trade Board operates a successful export intelligence system, to which companies can subscribe to obtain regular information giving excellent contacts aboard? Many companies subscribe to it and successfully follow up on the information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of that. Many larger companies make use of that facility, but it is expensive. It would be expensive for a small business with, say, 12 employees. I understand that in America larger companies receive tax incentives for engaging in training schemes with smaller companies. This is a very attractive idea. Firms such as Braemar and Pringle in the borders have expertise, which I am sure they would not mind passing on by setting
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
up seminars, consultations and so on if it was made worth their while. It need not cost a lot of money, but it could be very effective. Specific export training could be made the subject of a grant subsidy. That would not cost an enormous amount of money, but firms such as MacGeorge, which is now part of Dawson United Brands, could take advantage of such schemes. Much more could certainly be done.

We went to try to protect the Chinese from the worst endeavours and efforts of the governor of the colony—they needed a lot of protection. We had a five day introduction to manufacturing industry in the Pacific rim. For someone who is not an expert either in international affairs or in the affairs of the colony, it was a relevation to see how they conceive the global economy and the sort of competition that businesses in the United Kingdom and especially in the textile industry in the borders will have to face in the future. Those challenges are deeply worrying and we must respond to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government arae examining carefully the implications of the GATT settlement. The GATT deal is complete in principle and we are now considering the bilaterals. I should like an assurance that the Industry Department for Scotland is monitoring the discussions closely as it has great significance for the textile industry and agriculture. The Minister responsible for agriculture may want to comment on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall refer to one or two local issues in the borders with which I know the Minister is familiar, and which are significant to the economy of the region. They deserve special attention because of the discrepancies that are emerging in the GDP figures. When do the Government expect to hear from the European Commission on objective 5b funding? I know that the borders is not alone, and that applications have been sent from Dumfries and Galloway and other parts of Scotland. The rural economy needs and deserves the same attention as some of the urban areas of the economy. The needs are different but they are just as great in their own ways. Objective 5b eligibility would make it possible to make bids for infrastructure improvements from the admittedly restricted European funds. There are a series of projects throughout Scotland that are crying out for a bit of funding and additional capital investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Eyemouth harbour development is now in Ministers hands. That project is of signal importance to the economy of eastern Berwickshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will know of our efforts to try to improve the A7 south of Hawick. I accept that substantial improvements have been announced recently, but we are still waiting for the route action plan to be published, which has been delayed for a year. It is a worrying sign that the Government are not making the progress that they could to make the overall planning for the route made public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is widespread anxiety about the future of the Forestry Commission review. It would be helpful if the Minister would comment on that. A couple of weekends ago, the 	<i>Scottish Sunday Express</i> reported that Ministers were now inclining against the privatisation of the Forestry Commission. One of the most worrying things about that industry is the lack of planting that is being done. Apparently the reason for that is that nobody knows what is happening. The sooner a decision is made one way or the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0042">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
other, the better it will be for the industry. I hope that the decision will go in favour of retaining the Commission, because that is the only way of evening out the peaks and troughs in relation to planting and of guaranteeing security of supply to the manufacturing and processing industries. I hope that the Minister will turn his attention to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, on the vexed question of agriculture, perhaps in his reply the Minister will say a word about some of the remaining outstanding issues. The improvements that were made in the arable aid payments scheme were welcome, and I acknowledge that the Government must have been doing some work behind the scenes—very quietly, certainly—to achieve the success that they had. The base area will need to be revisited in future, but I acknowledge that the concessions that were wrung out of the Government at the last minute at the end of last year were extremely valuable and welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the Minister's views on the current quota allocation? Although only a small number of people are affected by the changes in the sheep regime, many people have been denied quota because of the new incomers who bought farms. The national reserve announcements that have been made to date have not dealt with all the problems. If the Minister could say how he sees that working out and how long he thinks it might take to resolve, that would give succour to those involved, some of whom face financial ruin if they do not get their quota allocation sorted out speedily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a valuable debate. We should concentrate on looking forward, not back. There are many difficulties, but a lot more can be done. If the Government would consider concentrating on the manufacturing sector and on small firms, and not neglecting the rural sector of the Scottish economy, I, for one, would be the happier for it.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Rachel Squire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, Mr. Martin. I am pleased to follow the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood), as I share his concern about the future of the Forestry Commission and echo his points about the uncertainty that is caused by the threat of privatisation not just to forestry but to public services generally, and to the coal industry and the dockyards, to mention just a few.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and the hon. Member for Ayr, who was entertaining and who has now left us, referred to talking up Scotland. The Government's economic policies, far from talking up the Scottish economy, are putting it down, and putting down the work force in particular. Government policies are turning the Scottish economy into a third-world economy by encouraging low pay, poor conditions and exploitation. Let me cite some examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In August last year the Government did away with wages councils. That will lead to lower wages for the 220,000 Scottish workers protected, and to a loss of spending power in the Scottish economy. For every person whose wages are cut by 10p an hour, £30 million is lost to the economy and the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
The extent of low pay in the Scottish economy is such that 45.1 per cent. of all Scottish employees earn less than £5.26 an hour. The Government have simply encouraged that number to grow and wages to fall even lower by abolishing legal statutory rights, implementing a three-year pay freeze for public service workers and encouraging the extensive privatisation of public services. We know full well that the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Bill is about creating a Nicholas Ridley-style council, which will meet only once a year to award private contracts. By the tax increases that were announced in the Budget, the Government have put down the Scottish work force. The measures will mean that the lowest-paid worker will be about £8.38 a week worse off. What will the Minister say to someone like a part-time hospital cleaner who depends on that £8.38 to pay for essential items and bills?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only people who the Government's economic policies favour are their rich and well-off friends. Between 1979 and 1990, the tax bills of the richest 20 per cent. of households reduced from 37.3 per cent. to 33.5 per cent., while the tax bills of the poorest 20 per cent. of households increased from 30.7 per cent. to 39.7 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's economic policies are putting down real people through not only low pay but privatisation. As someone whose constituency borders on the only deep mine that remains in Scotland, I condemn especially the Government's plans to privatise the coal industry. Coal miners are still low paid. How many Conservative Members would do the job of a coalface worker for a basic £210 a week? Moreover, it would be interesting to know how many hon. Members have been down a coal mine and experienced the conditions there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to mention the Rosyth dockyard. The hon. Member for Ayr referred to privatisation back in 1987 when, in fact, what happened was the introduction of commercial management. Will the Minister explain why that arrangement is being changed and why full-scale privatisation is going ahead? It will lead to a freeze in job opportunities, pay cuts and the loss of a core, permanent and highly skilled work force. What will the Government do to improve Scotland's economy? What will they do to stop the growth in low pay? What will they do to help the defence-dependent industries of which Fife has 30 per cent? What will they do to restore Scotland to the place that it once had, which was among the top of the league in manufacturing industry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.23 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: (Aberdeen, South) The hon. Member for Hamilton often feels the need to remind the Committee of his reputation with regard to parliamentary practice. This must be the first sitting of the Scottish Grand Committee when the hon. Gentleman has not shouted across the Room, "Remember Maastricht". I thought that the first tactic to employ in any battle was not to fight on one's opponent's terms. However, by his preventing the last sitting of our Committee from reporting the motion, that was exactly what he was doing. I assure him and other hon. Members that we shall gladly debate anywhere again and again the Scottish economy—London, Edinburgh or wherever. If the hon. Gentleman intends to use such tactics next week when we discuss in Committee the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Bill, it is hardly any wonder that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is looking so relaxed this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0043">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
It may be only a month since the Committee discussed the economy, but I thought that it would be useful to reread the report of those deliberations. Surprise, surprise, whose contribution to the debare caught my eye? None other than the hon. Member for Fife, Central. That was hardly surprising, however, as his was the only speech with a number in each paragraph. As the Under-Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood, said, it is usually a wrong number. I mentioned that for important reasons. Quite shamelessly, the hon. Gentleman singled out several individuals who, he claimed, happened to be contributors to the Conservative party, and they may well be. However, he was right to single out those people and I am prepared to do so today, but for another far more notable reason—for their outstanding contribution to Scotland's economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those mentioned by the hon. Gentleman, and others whom he could have mentioned but did not, represent the Scottish entrepreneurial spirit, which is the backbone of Scotland's economy. Their exporting zeal in recent year has seen Scotland increase its manufacturing exports to the European Community from just over 20 per cent. in 1974 to more than 60 per cent. today. In the process, that has guaranteed tens of thousands of jobs throughout Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is essential that we should recognise those people because, without them, we would not be having this debate. It is they who have helped to make the Scottish economy work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many respects, the hon. Member for Hamilton showed a great deal of unintentional foresight when he put his full weight behind his party's non-co-operation tactics, and that is why we are having another debate on the Scottish economy. As I said, it is a debate that we had to have: so much has happened since last month that we welcome it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The day after the Committee met, the Uruguay round of GATT was finally endorsed by 117 countries, thanks to the tenacity of my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. That agreement will bring significant potential gains to Scottish exporters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tariffs on goods traded between the United States and Europe are to be halved. Japanise tariffs on trade with the European Community are expected to be cut, by on average, about 35 per cent. The abolition of import duties on whisky is one of the most welcome developments of all and my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister can take particular pleasure in it after all his efforts in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is such a constrast with the direction in which the right hon. and learned Member for Monklands, East (Mr. Smith) would take the country, given half a chance. We remember the spectacle of the right hon. and learned Gentleman signing the manifesto of the European socialists late last year, which contained a commitment to a 35-hour working week. What would that do for the Scottish economy? Perhaps the Hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) will tell us when he winds up. It is a pleasure to see the hon. Gentleman sitting on the Opposition Front Bench—it is something that we thought would never happen. Perhaps he will tell us whether that it is a sell out on his part or has the hon. Member for Hamilton signed up to full membership of Scotland United?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Back to the good news. On the same day as the GATT resolution was passed, the underlying rate of inflation came down from 2.8 per cent. to 2.5 per cent.—the lowest in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
almost 30 years. That is, indeed, proof positive that the United Kingdom economy can look forward to growth without the spectre of high inflation. I can do no better than to quote The Press and Journal (Aberdeen) of 16 December and its banner headline, which stated:
	<br><q><p>"More good news on the economy".</p></q>
The financial commentators and the business community have recognised, even if the Labour party has not, the opportunities that lie ahead, and that is underlined in today's business page of the Glasgow newspaper 	<i>The Herald</i> and a headline stating:
	<br><q><p>"CBI confirms December surge in sales".</p></q>
If 	<i>The Herald</i> is willing to carry that headline, it must be true.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only yesterday, figures released by the BAA showed an increase of 6.5 per cent. in passengers using Aberdeen airport, a growth which reflects the continued vitality of the Grampian economy. I know that those increases were matched by similar increases in Edinburgh and Glasgow. There are more business travellers and more leisure flights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no room for complacency. A recent report into Scottish tourism, a major player in most of our constituencies, showed that Scotland cannot rest on its laurels in relation to that crucial aspect of the economy. In my area, Grampian Enterprise is involved in a £100,000, year-long visitors survey to build a profile of the typical visitor to the north-east of Scotland. That is essential if we are to persuade visitors to stay longer and spend more. The tourism changes that the Government have announced will ensure that such concerns are met and that striving for quality in tourism continues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many ways, my right hon. and hon. Friends who are responsible for reforms will play their part in ensuring that businesses gear up for the challenges ahead. Business men can look forward after 1996 to approaching one council and one councillor. Many businesses have long asked for such a one-door approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee of a few tenets which were expounded by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister last autumn: sound money, low inflation, low interest rates, free trade and deregulation. Those are the basics in which he is interested, and I and the Scottish people, too, are interested in them because they will ensure that the Scottish economy continues to flourish by manufacturing at home and exporting abroad.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.29 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson) said that he was willing to follow the debate to London, Edinburgh or anywhere else. I was reminded of the Scottish football team that he supports and almost expected him to finish with a flourish of, "If you go to Dublin we will follow on." He did not, because support for that team is not too popular in Aberdeen, South.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our debate has been interesting and has spanned not only two Committee sittings but two years. The debate started in December 1993 and many excellent speeches have been made, mostly, it must be said, from Opposition Members. One feature of the speeches made from the Conservative Members has been an attempt to draw comparisons between economic indicators under Tory and Labour Governments. The hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch) tried to compare the economic growth in the Scottish economy between 1981 and 1991 under Tory Governments with that between 1974 and 1979,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0044">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
when we last had a Labour Government. He tried to make a political point: that the economy fares better under Tory Governments than Labour Governments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other economic comparisons that Conservative Members could have made between Labour and Conservative Governments, but chose not to. Chief among those is the respective levels of unemployment under Labour and Tory Governments. Conservative Members chose not to make that comparison because they know that it would reflect very unfavourably on the Tory Governments who have been in office since 1979. For example, when Labour last held office in 1979, the level of Scottish unemployment was 140,000. I do not want to defend that figure—it was a terrible level of unemployment for our country. But two Tory Governments later, in 1987, the level of unemployment in Scotland had risen to a staggering 339,000. Even today, well into the fourth successive Tory Government, the level of unemployment in Scotland for December, according to the Library, was 234,000–67 per cent. above the level inherited by the Tories from Labour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note the hon. Gentleman's figures, but we were discussing whether to talk Scotland down or up. Would the hon. Gentleman give figures for the percentage of the working population that is in employment in Scotland compared with that in the rest of the European Community? I understand that we are number two in the league table of the percentage or the working population employed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that the hon. Gentleman is trying to move the argument away from something on which he does not want to concentrate. I shall persist with my point. The figure of 234,000 unemployed is just the doctored figure—the figure that has survived after all of the changes to the unemployment count made by successive Tory Governments since 1979.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They have made 21 of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. That figure does not tell us the real number of people who are unemployed and genuinely seeking work in Scotland, but who cannot find it because of the Tory Government's policies. The Minister got himself into a complete mess on this point, in particular over the International Labour Organisation definition of unemployed and how many Scots are genuinely out of work and seeking employment. He appeared to concede the basic point of my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central that 103,000 people in Scotland are out of work but not claiming benefit. He then tried to say that that number is offset by an equivalent number of Scots who are included in the claimant count—who are unemployed and receiving benefit—but who are not unemployed, as he put it, according to the ILO definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ILO definition says that people must be unemployed and available to start work in the next fortnight. Either the Government are paying unemployment benefit to people who are not available for work, who fail the Government's own availability test and are therefore not genuinely unemployed, or the Minister does not know what he is talking about. I suspect that the latter is the case, and that it is my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central who got the figures right. Those figures are available for any member of the Committee to inspect at the end of the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
If we include in the unemployment total the 103,000 people who do not qualify for benefit at present, together with the 37,000 others who are in training but do not have an employment contract or any prospect of a job, the real level of unemployment is about 400,000, or nearly three times what the Conservatives inherited from the Labour Government 15 year ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Tory party is what the Opposition have always claimed it to be: the party of mass unemployment. That label is no accident and the Tories cannot get away from it. Mass unemployment in Scotland has come about not because of Government incompetence—although, God knows, they are incompetent—but a deliberate act of policy. A national consensus existed at least until 1979. That consensus, shared by Governments of both colours, held that it was the Government's responsibility to pursue policies directed towards full employment. That consensus was broken in 1979 with the election of Mrs. Thatcher, as she then was. Three successive Tory Governments then set out to wreck that consensus, using mass unemployment as one of the key tools in their project, which they described as modernsing the British economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to consensus. Does he remember the winter of discontent—and of "disconsensus"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point and I will deal with it later. That Tory project, pursued since 1979, set out to emasculate the trade union movement and to cut labour costs by driving down wages and weakening working terms and conditions. The Tories also set out to cut social costs by attacking the welfare state, reducing welfare benefits and forcing people to work for less, in poorer conditions and with less job security. They have not been unsuccessful in that project. Indeed, they have been so successful that they can now place advertisements in German newspapers encouraging inward investment to this country because, as they say, our country has low wage costs and social costs and offers cheap labour. We are the only country in the European Union untouched by the social chapter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the basis on which the Tories have tried to modernise the British economy. Fundamental to that project has been the persistence of mass unemployment since 1979. My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) said that full employment gives a decisive advantage to labour over capital. He argued that during times of full employment, labour—the workers—is able to make the greatest social and economic advances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The years between 1945 and 1969 were a time of full employment. Unemployment in the United Kingdom was never more than 500,000 during those years and unemployment in Scotland was always less than 100,000. Those were the years when working people in Scotland made the greatest social advances. Those were the years when the national health service was established and the welfare state created, supported by the national insurance contributions. Those were the years when slums were cleared and massive public-sector housing programmes were started. Those were years of rising living standards and of expanding educational opportunity for ordinary working people. Those were the years of health and safety at work legislation and the years when massive social advances were made by ordinary people. Those advances were made because they were years of full employment.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
Governments then pursued policies directed towards full employment, not policies directed towards mass unemployment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am enjoying the hon. Gentleman's speech. May I bring him back to an important current issue, the potential loss of thousands of jobs with the reorganisation of British Gas? The hon. Gentleman will know that the Scottish National party and Unison in Scotland have pushed for at least two of the new business units of British Gas to locate their headquarters in Scotland. The hon. Member for Fife, Central, quoted in the 	<i>Evening Times</i> last week, seemed to argue for only one of the business units to be located in Scotland. That seems miserly, considering the importance of Scotland to that company's resources. Will he prevail on his hon. Friend to be more ambitious in what he wants from British Gas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central has just pointed out to me that that allegation is not true. It should be noted that the Opposition are pressing British Gas to locate one or two of the business units in Scotland. When that point was raised with the Minister, he could say only that he had not bothered to attend a meeting with British Gas that was arranged for last Friday. He said that he would be interested to learn what British Gas's intentions were but that it was British Gas's decision. The Government do not plan to locate any business units that emerge from the restructuring of British Gas in Scotland. There will be a market decision, taken by the British Gas management. The Government will have no input. That reveals that the Government have no intention of pursuing policies that will assist working people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The period between 1945 and 1969 was one of full employment and of social advances for ordinary working people. In the ensuing period Governments began to abandon full employment policies. That includes the Government between 1974 and 1979, which made a decisive mistake in doing so. Since then, there has been a period of unprecedented retreat for ordinary working people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The national health service has been starved of cash, fragmented and split into a two-tier service. The welfare state is under attack from every imaginable angle. Unemployment benefit is about to be replaced by a job seeker's allowance, which will be paid for a period reduced from 12 months to six months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I have given way enough for the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mass poverty has re-emerged: we thought we had seen the end of it many years ago. Britain has the unenviable distinction of having one in four of Europe's poor living within its shores. We do not have one in four of Europe's population but we have more of Europe's poor than any other country in the European Union. That is because of the Government's policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Student grants are being phased out and replaced with student loans, which are designed to lock thousands of youngsters out of higher education. The Government are not prepared to fund it. We saw last night that local government is being reorganised into ineffectiveness and that its resources are being slashed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
All that is happening against a background of sustained and persistent mass unemployment. The Government are deliberately pursuing such a policy because it suits their purpose of modernising the economy or, in other words, making sure that labour is cheaper, has less social protection and has fewer trade union rights than labour in any other country in the European Union. They could not have done that if there had been full employment and if workers bad been able to resist them through trade unions and political parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some people say that there is not much difference between the major Opposition party and the Government. At the next election the people who go to the ballot box will be able to vote for two different types of future: they can choose a future under the Tories in which society is scarred and disfigured by mass unemployment or they can opt for change and go for a party committed to full employment policies, getting this country back to work and creating a more social and just society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State set out his defence of the Government's economic record during the previous sitting of the Committee. He argued that inflation had been below 2 per cent. for almost the whole of last year. He said that the Government had been able to cut interest rates by no fewer than nine full percentage points, that GDP growth had occurred in six successive quarters and that exports were up across a range of industries. He forgot to mention that those favourable economic statistics are emerging not because of the success of the Government's economic policies but because of the abject failure of their policies. They might not like to be reminded that less than 18 months ago the Government were arguing that interest rates had to be maintained at 14 and 15 per cent. in order to defend a sterling exchange rate that they said was vital to our economic future. Less than 18 months ago, the Prime Minister was arguing with all the passion that only he can muster that a devaluation of sterling would be an economic disaster and a course upon which he would not allow the Government to embark. The Government were so set against sterling devaluation that on a single day in September 1992 they wasted up to £5,000 million of our currency reserves—taxpayers' money—trying to defend an exchange rate that could not, in the end, be defended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the devaluation that was forced upon them begins to lead to the economic recovery that we are now seeing, leading to increases in output, better figures and so on, those same people have the sheer gall and effrontery to try to claim the credit for themselves. It is almost as if a car thief, having been apprehended, tried and sentenced, who is safely banged up inside Barlinnie, tries to take credit for the reduction in the crime rate as a result. The Government are convincing nobody. They are a Government who are not in charge of events, but who react to events. They are without an economic strategy. As the former Chancellor the right hon. Member for Kingston upon Thames (Mr. Lamont) said in words that we shall never forget, they are a Government

Roxburgh and Berwickshire, we have had a long series of speeches running Scotland down. The devastating inaccuracy of the speech of the hon. Member for Dundee, East highlighted how far from reality the Labour party is.

The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire referred to the importance of small firms, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr, in a pugnacious speech. That importance was highlighted in the Budget by my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor, who introduced measures to help them, such as audit requirements, the rise in VAT thresholds, the reduction in national insurance contributions and protection for the costs of changes to the statutory sick pay arrangements. Larger companies will be encouraged to make prompt payments to the smaller ones.

My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will reply in detail in correspondence to the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire on the GDP, economic trends and the export initiative. The setting-up of the Scottish Textile Association is a big plus, supported by Scottish Enterprise. All the hon. Gentleman's comments, especially about the Scottish textile industry and the importance of the situation post-GATT must be considered carefully. He referred to the Forestry Commission review group. I have written countless letters to many members of the Committee and have answered questions about the review group, which was set up a year ago to examine our forestry policy and which is expected to report at the end of next month. Ministers will examine the results and reach a conclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall not give way, as I have only 10 minutes left. The consultants whom we have appointed will advise on access and incentives. Our conclusion will be in the interests of forestry. Hon. Members are wrong to jump to conclusions, as they did on the issue of water. I can go into no further detail now as we are awaiting the review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire asked about livestock quotas. I appreciate that it is a complicated issue that is bound by the Commission's detailed rules. The hon. Gentleman knows that we are taking applications from priority one and priority two applicants in respect of the national reserve and when we have considered that we shall look at priority three. I accept that that will cause hardship to some, but we are tightly constrained by the Commission's policy. With regard to the base area on the arable issue, that matter is fixed, and there is no question of going over it again. Hon. Members will know the old saying: "God can't change the past, only historians". We cannot go back and change that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are experiencing success in agriculture, with a substantial increase in Government funding. Spending on agriculture and fisheries in the current year will be up by 12.5 per cent. and over the next three years by 17.9 per cent. In 1994–95, the Scottish Office will spend £370 million on agriculture—£240 million on livestock and £130 million on arable. That is an enormous sum, much of which was not in place before the last review of the common agricultural policy. That is why the increase in the average income from agriculture has risen substantially. I welcome that, because it had fallen too low. We are now beginning to emerge from
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
that difficulty and farmers should have the confidence to invest in the future and play their full part in developing the rural economy which is so important to Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is now possible, especially after the recent GATT decision, to see an assured future for Scottish farming. The area and headage payments are excluded from the European Community's commitment to cut domestic support by 20 per cent. under the GATT rules. Also, under the "peace" clause in the GATT rules, there is a nine-year period during which the common agricultural policy cannot be challenged. Altogether, agriculture, fishing and forestry have a very good future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a good-news debate on the economy. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has shown that the GDP is improving and is at a high level, and that economic recovery is continuing. That is reflected by the unemployment figures. It is pathetic to listen to the hon. Member for Dundee, East hammering away about mass unemployment. The Government are concerned about every unemployed person and are doing everything possible to put matters right. To say that we are complacent about mass unemployment is absolute rubbish, and the hon. Gentleman knows it. He should try to be constructive, instead of sitting on the Back Benches week in, week out and baying a lot of rubbish, along with his hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley. It is time that the Labour party began to be constructive and to show that it is part of the community in Scotland, by helping to regenerate the economy and create jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now have the opportunity to do that, with low interest rates and low inflation. In the Budget we gave assistance to industry in many ways, and the Scottish Office has the highest spend on record—£14 billion. That is a tremendous asset which is going into the economy of Scotland. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Fife, Central causes nothing but trouble with his bogus statistics. He should try to produce something constructive on his computer. He has been totally destroyed by his attack on the Government yesterday on the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Bill, because he knows that his own region of Fife is desperately keen to receive the money. The hon. Gentleman is as two-faced as anyone whom I have met for a long time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Things are getting wee bit heated. It would help if the Minister did not make any personal remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise on this one occasion—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Opposition members must realise that a huge sum of money in the Scottish budget is being spent on matters that concern them—roads, housing and schools. Everything is going forward positively, yet the Opposition claim that the Government cut, cut, cut—	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is too much background noise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many of the cuts that are highlighted in the press are cuts in local authority budgets that are ridiculously high. Of course they must be cut to keep within reasonable Government guidelines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Huge sums of money are being invested in industry through Scottish Enterprise. Some £452 million has been invested, which is an increase on last year. Local enterprise

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
companies are progressing well with training and local development. We have the great advantage in Scotland of the extension of objective 5b status, to which the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire referred. We are awaiting the final details from the Community to put that matter in train.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are going ahead with Scottish Homes; £323 million is an enormous and good spend on Scottish housing. This year, £244 million is being spent on water and sewerage services. Those sums represent investment in the infrastructure of Scotland, which, in turn, will produce jobs for the construction industry. Even in sectors that are far removed from industry, such as Scottish National Heritage, £40 million will be spent on improving heritage and conservation in Scotland. That represents an increase of 10 per cent. We are allowing money for Loch Lomond, for the Cairngorms scheme and for the European directive, which we intend to carry out this year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State said in his public expenditure statement in the House that specific money for Loch Lomond was in the budget. However, when I asked a parliamentary question about it, no such sum was mentioned. The Minister will know that the working party set a figure of £1 million for Loch Lomond and it wishes that money to be available urgently. Will the Minister give a commitment that Scottish Enterprise will be given that £1 million to spend on Loch Lomond, as the working party so wishes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not talking about Scottish Enterprise. It is more likely that SNH will be involved. We are reaching a conclusion on the matter and we shall announce soon our plans for the Cairngorms and for Loch
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
Lomond. Money will be made available to carry out such plans; there would have been no point in announcing measures that we did not intend to support. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will be as pleased as I am that we are making constructive progress in resolving difficulties in those two honeypot areas. We want to attract tourists to them, yet we must have facilities in place for them when they arrive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to the welter of disparaging remarks made by the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley. Some of them referred to unemployment. Naturally, we are anxious about British Aerospace as, indeed, is my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr. We are in touch with the company and we are noting its interest in joint ventures in the world scene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West, is looking forward soon to meeting Councillor Malcolm Waugh to talk about the rail issue and the A77 link road. That will be helpful. I am not as disparaging as Opposition Members are about railways. Each contact that I have had with the Department of Transport and ScotRail has shown that railways will continue to run in south-west Scotland, and that there should be no worry about them. I am looking forward after the consultation period to hearing about the amount of finance that will be available for the west coast main line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All in all, the Opposition have again been put to flight. I have not heard one constructive word from them. We are doing something and are improving the economy of Scotland and we can look forward to the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
