	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Ian Lang)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered class XIV, votes 17 and 18.</p></q>
Before I begin, it is my very pleasant duty to welcome you, Mr. Maxton, to the Chair. It is a promotion to a pinnacle of political activity to which many of us have long looked forward. We congratulate you and wish you well in that position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted to have the opportunity to talk about Scottish education, in particular about the Government's proposals set out in our White Paper "Higher Still: Opportunity for all". In Scotland, education rightly enjoys a special status. It is a key part of our national identity and we can be justifiably proud of having a system of education that can stand comparison with the best in the world. Nevertheless, there is no room for complacency and we must strive not only to maintain the quality of education in Scotland, but to improve it. That is the key aim of the proposals set out in "Higher Still" that I announced in March.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall focus on those proposals today, but before I do so I shall remind the Committee of our considerable achievements in education in recent years and of the events which have led to the reforms. Real progress has been made in education over the past 15 years and Conservative Members can be justifiably proud of our record. Standards in school education have improved enormously compared with when we took office in 1979. Let me draw the Committee's attention to some of the facts. Pupils are now gaining better qualifications than ever before. In 1991–92, the percentage of leavers obtaining at least one higher rose to 42 per cent—the highest level so far recorded and 10 percentage points higher than in 1981–82. At the other end of the scale, the percentage leaving with no qualifications in 1991–92 fell to under 10 per cent. for the first time compared with 28 per cent. a decade earlier. Staying-on rates in schools have also increased dramatically so that more than 73 per cent. of pupils now stay on into fifth year. The number staying on to S6 has also risen sharply and now stands at more than 37 per cent. More people go on to further and higher education than ever before and gain advanced qualifications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those significant advances have come about as a direct result of our education policies through the 1980s and 1990s. We have put in place a broad spectrum of exciting education initiatives over the past decade which demonstrate our determination to ensure that our young
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2</span>
people are equipped with the knowledge and skills they need to play their full part in the economy and in society. I shall briefly remind the Committee of a few of those initiatives by setting the scene for our "Higher Still" proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those in primary school and the early stages of secondary school, we have put in place the Government's five to 14 programme. For those in the 14 to 18 age group, we have developed standard grades and carried out revisions to Highers and to certificate of sixth year studies to make them consistent with standard grade. We have also introduced radical reform of vocational education based on the action plan of 1983 which introduced the national certificate, a qualification based on internally assessed modules. That modular structure has been extended to the higher national certificate and the higher national diploma and is the basis of the occupationally specific Scottish vocational qualification, which we introduced in 1989. we also announced the introduction of general Scottish vocational qualifications—gSVQs—in 1991, which is a broadly based vocational qualification designed to meet the needs of 16 to 19-year-olds at school or in further education. Of course there is also our skillseekers initiative, which gives choice and responsibility to young people to increase their motivation to train.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, during the 1980s and early 1990s, higher education expanded extremely rapidly. The participation rates of young Scots in higher education now stands at a record level of 35 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not it be graceful to pay tribute to the part played in all such achievements by the education authorities of Lothian and Strathclyde? Does the Secretary of State recollect that some of us sat through debates for 177 hours, mostly in this Room? Any detailed examination reveals that smaller education authorities, which do not have large resources, might not be able to keep up levels of provision similar to those of Lothian and Strathclyde. Should not the Secretary of State at least pay tribute to what has been done?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to assure the hon. Gentleman that my courtesy extends far beyond Lothian and Strathclyde. Of course, I pay tribute not only to those education authorities but to all education authorities, the teaching profession and all those involved in seeking to enhance the quality and achievements in Scottish education, particularly the education authorities of Borders and Dumfries and Galloway, both of which have achieved higher educational standards than the substantially larger authorities of Lothian or Strathclyde.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such major developments in education have meant that more people than ever before want to stay on at school and follow their aspirations to the highest level that they can before going on to further education, higher education or employment. Although the present system has many strengths, it has some significant weaknesses, to which I shall now turn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we have been successful in persuading large numbers to stay on at school, many of those who do so
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0076">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>3</span>
leave at the end of the fifth year with a mixture of Scottish Examination Board and Scottish Vocational Education Council qualifications that are not easily marketable. Students do not necessarily have an opportunity at school to acquire vocationally relevant skills and knowledge, nor to develop the core skills that are so important in future life, especially in employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although Scotland prides itself on having a broad curriculum, it is not reflected in the achievements of students after the age of 16. Only 20 per cent. of fifth-year students gain four highers or more and over 50 per cent. gain no more than one higher. Such concerns were highlighted in representations from the Scottish Examination Board in 1989. Our response to those representations and to the growing opinion in Scotland that it was time to review the arrangements for courses and awards in the later years of secondary education was to appoint a committee under the chairmanship of Professor John Howie to review curriculum and examinations in the fifth and sixth years of secondary education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In March 1992, the Committee published its comprehensive and far-reaching report which stimulated a healthy and penetrating debate about Scottish education. There was no serious challenge to the committee's concise critique of the present system. The main weaknesses that the committee identified were: the dash and drift problem in which the pace and progress expected of pupils in S5 was often too great and, by contrast, the programme in S6 was undemanding for some; examination blight in which the business of taking examinations dominated school education each May and June and was preceded by prelims which took up valuable teaching time and broke up the continuity of coherence of learning; and a lack of proper vocational education such that, while arrangements in schools had improved students could still end up with haphazard collections of national certificate modules and, moreover, such qualifications did not enjoy the same status as highers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In its evaluation of present arrangements, the committee concluded that the status quo was not an option if Scotland were to have an education system worthy of an advanced society in the year 2000. it proposed radical changes, including two distinct types of group awards: the Scottish certificate—SCOTCERT—which would have a vocational slant and a heavy emphasis on internal assessment; and the Scottish baccalaureate, which would be academically baised and the normal route to higher education. The committee also proposed to move standard grade forward to S3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We consulted on the report and over 300 responses were received, covering a wide spectrum of interests. I appreciate the thoughtful and constructive criticisms and contributions made by respondents. One of most cogent responses to the Howie report came from the Educational Institute of Scotland. Until now, the EIS has made a distinguished contribution to the consideration of policy on upper secondary education in Scotland. For example, the 1990 annual general meeting of the institute approved as policy that there should be an examination structure in upper secondary schools that would
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
	<br><q><p>"allow pupils the optimum choice, which would encourage young people to enter further and higher education and which would provide a coherent educational experience for all pupils."</p></q>
It is little wonder, therefore, that the EIS welcomed the establishment of the Howie committee. In its response to the Howie report, the EIS summed up the position rather well. It said:
	<br><q><p>"There is an emerging consensus that the status quo is not an option for the longer term."</p></q>
However, the institute expressed concerns about the Howie proposals. It opposed the proposal to move standard grade from S4; it opposed the introduction of a group certificate; and it opposed so-called twin-tracking. On each of those three points, the EIS and the Government are at one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to identify any substantial differences between the EIS's proposals for the reform of upper secondary education and the Government's. The institute's deputy general secretary acknowledged that when he said that the package of proposals is:
	<br><q><p>"quite a good scenario educationally. It meets a number of things we are asking for."</p></q>
In the light of all that, to say that my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton), and I are a little perplexed at the institute's behaviour since our proposals were published is to put it mildly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having given the background, I shall now turn to the Government's decisions on the way forward. I shall begin by saying that, in reaching the decisions that we have announced, my colleagues and I took careful account of respondents' concerns. The decisions show the Government's responsiveness to the issues raised in consultation. In particular, we were impressed by the need to build on the strengths of the existing arrangements; to provide demanding but attainable standards for all pupils; to encourage pupils to achieve breadth as well as depth in their studies; to ensure that vocational qualifications are properly regarded as being of comparable value to academic qualifications; and for change to be evolutionary. I believe that those aims can best be achieved through the package of reforms that I announced earlier this year, which are detailed in our White Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In January we announced that we had decided not to accept the committee's recommendation that standard grade should be moved from S4 to S3, so standard grade courses remain in the third and fourth year of secondary education as is the case at present. I believe that that is the right decision on educational grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the fifth and sixth year of secondary education courses of the Scottish Examination Board and the Scottish Vocational Education Council will be brought into a unified curriculum and assessment system. That will be a major step towards parity of esteem between vocational and academic qualifications. We shall also develop new curriculum guidelines covering breadth, coherence, progression and core skills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0077">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
Post-16 courses will have better continuity and progression. All students should be able to continue studying at a level that is neither too easy nor too demanding for them. Courses will be available at five levels: foundation, general and credit, which correspond to the equivalent levels at standard grade; and higher and new advanced higher. Students will be able to take whatever mix of academic and vocational courses is most appropriate to their needs and gain marketable qualifications in the form of national certificates, highers and advanded highers—all leading to acceptable entrance qualifications for higher education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The highers will remain, but with modifications. Courses will be drawn from current SEB and SCOTVEC provision, so that students are able to study vocational as well as academic courses at demanding levels. The recommended study time for each higher will be extended from 120 hours to 160 hours. The higher courses will be made up of modules with a mixture of internal and external assessment, but external assessment will remain the main method of assessment for full higher and advanced higher courses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be a new level of qualification of advanced higher to set a clear and demanding benchmark for the most able students. It will build on highers to provide coherent two-year courses in S5 and S6, which promote high levels of attainment. It will be broadly equivalent to the level of the certificate of sixth-year studies and will incorporate the content of current CSYS courses, as appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Candidates who continue to the most advanced level of study will be encouraged to bypass the external assessments at higher level. That will reduce the time spent on examination and enable higher standards to be achieved. All students who are capable of advanced higher will be encouraged to take that route. Students who do not wish to undertake more advanced levels of studies will be able to leave after highers at S5 or do their highers over a two-year period. Other courses, based mainly on existing national certificate modules, will continue to be offered to meet the needs of students for whom highers are too immediately demanding. Some students will take combinations of courses that meet the requirements for the general Scottish vocational qualifications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although, as I have said, standard grade will remain in S4, we are taking some steps to encourage the most able pupils to achieve their full potential at that stage. Thus we shall relax the present stage restriction to allow pupils capable of taking standard grade at credit level in a subject at the end of S3 to do so. We shall also allow progression to higher work in S4 by making available and accrediting units of study at that level. In addition, to provide progression for the most able pupils at the early stage of secondary education, a new level F will be introduced into the five to 14 curriculum structure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the announcement of all the changes, but what have the educational bodies said to the Secretary of State about the strain that is put on the teaching profession by all the changes? Individually they
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
may or may not be justified, but cumulatively they present an enormous problem to the teaching profession, beyond the kind of challenge that one ought to ask people to accept. What is the Secretary of State's response?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are studying the matter carefully. We have consulted widely with a range of bodies—such as local authorities and educational groups—to ensure that the introduction of the proposals puts the minimum burden on the teaching profession. They are being brought in gradually and I shall talk about the development process shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise to the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) that the changes are essentially evolutionary, easing progression through the system to remove bottlenecks, snags and inhibiting factors so that pupils at all levels can have the optimum opportunity to achieve qualifications at the level of which they are capable. Although cumulatively there seem to be many changes, they smooth and simplify the educational process rather than complicate it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State says that there will be a smooth transition. What cost has the Scottish Office put on the changes and what resources will be given to the teachers and lecturers involved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not yet know what the precise cost will be at the time of implementation. The developmental work on which we are now embarking will determine that. In the current public expenditure survey, covering the period of development work, we have provided for an additional £2 million, which we are confident will be more than sufficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The national record of achievement, which we launched in 1991, will play an important part under the new arrangements. It is designed to present a simple record of an individual's achievement through education, training and working life. It encourages people to take an active part in their self-development and could help to identify training needs. It also gives employers a convenient and comprehensive record of what someone can do and of their formal qualifications. All courses passed under the new arrangements will be presented on a single certificate and achievement in the new awards will be recorded by students in their national record of achievement folders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reforms will provide more demanding targets for able students but will not sacrifice the potential for breadth which has characterised Scottish education. By extending the recommended study time, it is expected that many students who would previously have narrowly failed, will have real prospects of success, while others can expect to earn better grades. The inclusion of vocationally orientated courses at higher and advanced higher level should help to ensure that the curriculum is relevant to a broader range of students. It should also dispel any lingering association of vocational education with lower level education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reforms will build on the coherent curriculum and assessment framework that has already been put in place
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0078">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
for five to 14-year-olds. The new framework addresses the weaknesses identified in the Howie committee's review of the curriculum and examinations in the fifth and sixth years and also responds to the concerns of consultees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have taken particular account of the current concerns about teachers' workload. We have designed the new arrangements so that they are developed from what teachers are currently doing. Teaching methods will not change and there will be as little change as possible to the content of what is being taught.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the recent success of having many youngsters stay on at school, some popular schools are becoming overcrowded. There are minimum numbers of children who are obliged to be allowed into school under the parents' charter at the first year stage. With many children coming in and many children staying on, schools have tended to overcrowd. Are there any proposals to reassess the intake numbers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right to identify that problem. The education authorities must adapt to it. We shall also take account of the needs and aspirations of education authorities and pressures on individual schools in their areas, when we consider the allocation of resources—both revenue and for capital expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) made a good point. The Secretary of State says that local authorities must do something about the situation. However, I am mindful of an incident when a parent wanted a child in S3 in Holyrood school in Glasgow several years ago. The headteacher refused because the maximum practical class size in the biology class in S3 was 21. Despite that decision, the parent went to the sheriff court. The sheriff ruled that, in a school of 1,500 children, one more pupil did not cause any more inconvenience. That ruling betrayed the sheriffs lack of insight into the world of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, schools are powerless if recourse to the law of the land is taken and, therefore, the responsibility must come back to the Secretary of State to take action against overcrowding in schools. What powers does the Secretary of State have to ensure that such faults are remedied?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should put his remarks in context. The Government have given parents the ability to choose the school that their children go to. That power was fiercely resisted by the Labour party. We have increased education expenditure by 54 per cent. in real terms over the past 15 years. We have reduced pupil teacher ratios, at primary and secondary level, over that period. Against that background, the Government have considerably enhanced education opportunities for young people in Scotland. We shall continue to react to a changing situation—which is a problem that arises from our success—and to attribute and accord resources to take account of such developments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our proposals on "Higher Still" have been warmly welcomed by the public and professionals. There have also been a few negative and ill-founded criticisms from some
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
commentators. Some have criticised the measures as creating a fast track. That is not the case, nor is it a term that we have used. I stress that the new arrangements are designed to provide opportunities for all to gain the best qualifications of which they are capable. The task for schools is to try to make arrangements to enable pupils to progress at the fastest pace at which they are individually capable. The proposals provide a framework to help schools meet the needs of all pupils, including those who can attain beyond credit level in some subjects by the end of S4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some commentators have also criticised the time scale for implementation. It is more important to get it right than get it quickly. However, in the interests of pupils, it should be as quick as possible. The implementation date of 1997 to 1998 was selected on two grounds. First, given the universal acceptance that the status quo was not an option, it was important that we should not delay in introducing the desired changes. Secondly, as I have just said, the new framework will be based firmly on existing courses In that sense it will be different from the earlier standard grade development programme or the action plan. Indeed, it will build on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The EIS has made a fuss about the proposals. I am slightly puzzled by this since the "Higher Still" proposals appear to match closely what the EIS wanted. I could quote many examples of the Howie committee's findings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, as hon. Members will know, the EIS has recently conducted a ballot of its members apparently aimed at boycotting involvement in implementation of "Higher Still" and other related developments. What that organisation thinks that that action will do to its reputation as a body that advances the professional standing of education, I do not know. That is an unfortunate approach to take on educational matters that will improve considerably the educational and ultimately employment attainments of our young people. It seems very shortsighted of the EIS to decline involvement in the devlopment process, particularly if it wants to help ensure that the arrangements for delivery of "Higher Still" avoid undue pressures on teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not dismiss or underestimate the concerns of many teachers about the stresses and strains of school education. As i have already said, we have taken careful account of the implications of the proposals for teachers' work load and I assure the Committee that there will be no impact on teachers in the classroom for at least a year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

the Government met in the proposals and the secretary of the EIS, who welcomed the proposals, now seeks to ballot members with a view to taking a contrary stance. I am not being macho or confrontational. I am encouraging the EIS to consider the interests of Scottish education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A comprehensive development programme is now being undertaken, which will provide the support and guidance that teachers need to introduce the changes. We have invited teachers' representatives and their unions to play a full part in the process. We have not closed the door on further discussions and my hon. Friend the under-secretary expects to resume his rounds of meetings with the teachers' unions and other interest groups later this year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some people have asked whether the proposals will lead to a narrowing of the curriculum. They will not. It will still be possible for some students to achieve five highers by the end of S5 and guidance will be offered to schools in the course of the development programme on how that can be achieved. Of course, there is ample opportunity to take five highers or more over S5 and S6.I am confident that the reforms will lead to a Scottish education system that is second to none as we move into the next century.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, if I have time I shall give way when I have made more progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reforms will ensure our key objectives of higher standards of attainment, recognised qualifications for all, an even gradient of progression, access by students to a wider range of courses of a general vocational nature, as well as academic subjects, breadth of attainment, competence in core skills, consolidation of earlier reforms making the system simpler, more efficient and easily understood by students, parents, employers and higher education institutions and combining the variety of courses currently offered into a unified curriculum and assessment system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, the proposals in "Higher still" have a significance that extends far beyond the walls of the classroom. It is no exaggeration to say that the development and upgrading of skills levels in Scotland is vital to our competitiveness, and that competitiveness is essential to maintaining and improving the prosperity of all our people. The proposals will help us achieve the Scottish targets for competitiveness, launched on 21 March by the Scottish Advisory Council for Education and Training Targets and which I had no hesitation in endorsing. I do not regard those targets as a ceiling beyond which we may not rise, bur rather as steps on an ascending
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
ladder. A key theme of the Government's White Paper "Competitiveness: Helping Business to Win" is to expand young peoples' opportunities and to give them the highest standards of education and training. "Higher Still" has a vital role to play in helping us to meet that objective. Our proposals for "Higher Still" will play an important part in providing the highly qualified and well motivated work force so important to guaranteeing our future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State said that his proposals would provide opportunities for all pupils.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with interest to the candidates for the Labour party leadership asserting their support for the individual, freedom and choice—ideals for which the Conservative party has fought for years. I am beginning to wonder whether that support for individualism and choice is skin deep.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I should like to say a few words about the development programme on which we are working to take the reforms forward. We are announcing today appointments to a new high level strategy group, which will take forward the development work needed to implement the changes I have described today. The role of the strategy group will be to take decisions on and monitor the strategy for the implementation of the "Higher Still" proposals in 1997–98. That group will provide the necessary strategic overview and the opportunity for full consulation with and representation of all the key interests. In addition, three task groups will provide specialist advice to the strategy group on curriculum, assessment, staff development and information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Goverment will provide substantial direct funding over the period of the development programme from now until the new arrangements are fully in place. I have already referred to the figure of £2 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The development programme will provide the staff development, support and guidance that teachers will need to introduce the changes successfully. There will be staff development for education managers, guidance staff, principal teachers and subject teachers from 1995–96. Teachers will have the opportunity to contribute to the development programme in some cases as direct contributors or through responding to consultation on the main implementation proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to stress that ongoing teaching and learning will not be affected during the development programme—teachers will continue to deliver existing courses. As I have already said, the early phases of the development programme—the first year at least—will not affect their daily work load. We do not expect the impact of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0080">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
developments on work-load in subsequent years to be significant. We will ensure that teachers in the field are kept fully informed of plans through a series of newsletters, the first of which has already been published. We shall also publish further details of the development programme in the summer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my remarks I have tried to demonstrate the extent to which the Government have provided young people in Scotland with improved standards of education. Our plans for upper secondary reform will build on that progress. I look forward to seeing those exciting reforms develop and take shape in the years to come. They will mark the latest steps in a long evolution of the Scottish education system. As our system of education evolves and develops further, I am confident that it will do so against the background of higher standards in education and increasing opportunities for all our young people to gain the best qualifications of which they are capable. I am confident that our policies for education in Scotland, including our "Higher Still" proposals, will meet with success and I commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of the Opposition, I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Maxton. I know of your past firmness and fairness and I shall try to remain in order, as will other Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome and commend Professor John Howie's report on Scottish education. He provided a considerable service in highlighting the inadequacies of the upper secondary school curriculum. Those inadequacies, as the Secretary of State said, include the two-term dash, the lack of a steady gradient between S3 and S6 and the relatively slow pace of learning in the early stages of secondary education. More important is the focus on the overall standards and inadequate level of attainment of Scottish pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Howie report failed to achieve consensus and in March 1994 the Government published its document, "Higher Still". Rarely has a Scottish Office document been more eagerly anticipated. It had a four year gestation period—the Secretary of State said that it was not the time that was important but to get it right. We want to focus on whether the Government have got it right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give the Government credit for a system to allow differentiation and recognition of different levels of achievement. I refer with uncharacteristic immodesty to my article in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> in December 1992 before publication of the "Higher Still" document when I stated:
	<br><q><p>"What I hope and believe will emerge at the end of the debate will be a single two-tier, two-part certificate course for S5 and S6 offering different levels of achievement to accommodate the range of abilities in the upper secondary school."</p></q>
I welcome the Government's acceptance of that proposal, but we are concerned about the context in which the innovation is taking place. I shall refer to the resources, the time scale, teacher work load and, equally important, if not more so, local government reform.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many educationists and others have commented on the document and communicated their comments to the Scottish Office, not in a spirit of confrontation or as a pretext for rejecting "Higher Still", but in a genuine attempt to ensure that highers are replaced by a system that encourages more young people to stay on, enable those young people to receive an adequate reward for doing so and prepares them better for higher education. Sadly, the Government do not seem to be prepared to reconsider in any signifcant way the blueprint put together within the fortified confines of St. Andrew's house. If the Government continue to pretend that they have achieved perfection in one go, it will be a disaster for the upper secondary schools—more so than it is at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has mentioned fast track. There is deep concern about fast track, which has been described as a system whereby the high fliers get their standard grade in S3 while others in secondary schools take it in S4. Considerable timetabling difficulties are associated with that system. I shall quote from a letter, which the depute general secretary of the Educational Institute of Scotland, Mr. Fred Forrester sent to the Minister and to other politicians, bringing to their attention the implications of fast track. He wrote that, with the introduction of the new level F into the five-to-14 programme, that fast track for a small minority of pupils will have
	<br><q><p>"many knock-on effects throughout the entire system, secondary schools and primary schools. A new level F will require the writing of new attainment targets and programmes of study across all areas of the five-to-14 curriculum. Furthermore, a new level cannot simply be slotted in without reviewing the existing five levels in the programme. This proposal looks very much like a total review of five-to-14 at a time when, in most schools, only English language five-to-14 and mathematics five-to-14 are beginning to be implemented."</p></q>
As a result of an additional element put in by the Government, there will be a knock-on effect on the entire education system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within the five-to-14 programme, level E has been designed so that most pupils attain that at the end of S2, but now more able pupils will be expected to attain it by primary seven. A race could be on, whereby parents would encourage their children to get into the fast track at that early stage. I well remember the introduction of the old grade in 1968 and 1969, which was designed only for a certain percentage of the population, but in fact 100 per cent. of the school population sat that examination because their parents did not want them to be left out. I think that the same symptoms are in evidence in the fast track approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sadly, what will be at stake as a result of fast track could be the child centred approach in primary schools, which emphasises the development of all abilities and not merely academic abilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0081">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
There is no doubt that the amount of work involved and the timetabling implications of fast track are staggering. The implementation of the new F level in the five-to-14 programme will, indeed, mean the rewriting of all existing higher grade and SCYS curricula into modular form. How, can the Secretary of State say that there are few implications, when the five-to-14 programme has to be completely modernised and all existing higher grade and sixth year certificate work must be rewritten into modular form?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State and the Minister will say that that is evolutionary, that it contains the same elements and that all it is is a patchwork approach. But it is not a patchwork approach—it is a total rewrite. That must have serious time and resource implications.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman has a special expertise in this matter and I want to ask him a genuine question. In his experience of teaching, do teachers always use modules in the classroom? I put it to him that the modules used by teachers in a practical form are being embraced in a manner that can be used to bring about qualifications gained in other ways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am at ease with the use of modules, as is the Scottish education community, but it will require tremendous co-operation between the Scottish Examination Board, SCOTVEC and the education community. I am explaining the implications of advancing to modular courses. We have to tackle the issue of vocational education which has been lamentably neglected in Scottish and United Kingdom education for many years. The new vocational and advanced higher courses will have to be developed and new systems of moderation and assessment will have to be created. That material will have to be new. It cannot, as the Secretary of State said, be adapted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All those changes come at a time when the teacher work load is reaching crisis proportion in our schools. We know that from our meetings as Members of Parliament with educationists and parents in our constituencies. But the Government response is to pretend that that does not exist. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West is living in a fairy tale. In a letter dated 10 May to me he said:
	<br><q><p>"We have designed the new arrangements so that they are a development of what teachers are doing at present. There will be as little change as possible in the content of what teachers are already teaching. Changes will be phased and evolutionary and will build on existing good practice."</p></q>
That is the theory. The practice is another matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State mentioned a two-year time scale to 1997. That is two years before the Minister's optimistic date for full implementation of the five-to-14 programme. Yet it is envisaged that the Howie recommendations and strand F will be added to that programme before the date given by the Minister. As a result of that, last Christmas, when I should have been feeling warm to everyone in the world, I called the Minister "clueless" after he said that in 1997 we will need no advisers and therefore
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
	<br><q><p>"the Government sees little need to maintain central support in the 28 proposed councils to help schools adapt to innovation."</p></q>
I retract that remark but I see that he is not alone—he has been joined by the Secretary of State. A two-year period to implement the Howie proposals is unrealistic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The resource implications are extreme. The Secretary of State mentioned £2 million for the development work. But, before "Higher Still" was published, the Scottish Consultative Council on the Curriculum, which advises the Secretary of State, sent a communication to the Scottish Office. The chief executive, Cameron Harrison, said that it would take £18 million to develop the proposals and predicted that the exercise would take up to nine years, with implementation taking considerably longer. What has changed? If an official body and teachers say that, surely it is time for the Secretary of State to listen to the education community. I repeat the words of Cameron Harrison who said:
	<br><q><p>"I would anticipate that when the Secretary of State eventually takes the decision, having taken account of the inputs, the education community will be comfortable in moving forward together."</p></q>
The education community and St. Andrew's house are out of phase. The Secretary of State should heed the words of the chief executive so that everyone walks in tandem on the issue, which is extremely important for the future of our schools and of our country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that my hon. Friend has had much teaching experience.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Without a Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Then they would know the problems facing teachers in secondary education in Scotland today. If they do not send their children to local authority schools, why do they not go and see what teachers are facing day in, day out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an eminently sensible suggestion. Will the Minister join me on a visit to schools—just the two of us; without a pack of advisors—to see what is going on and then think for ourselves? I am sure that the Minister will consider that request when he replies. The only way to inject an element of reality into the process is to get Ministers into classrooms, not to teach, but to sit at a desk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In denying the need for additional resources, the Government are claiming that, with so many young people staying on, there will not be an increase in school rolls. That is an extraordinary statement when one considers that part of the rationale for reforming upper secondary schools was that the staying-on rate in Scotland was appallingly low. For example, 54 per cent. of 16-year-olds in Scotland are in full-time education. That is woeful in comparison with some of our European partners, some of which have rates upwards of 90 per cent. How can the Government say that there will not be an increase in pupil rolls? It goes against all the evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0082">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
In their desperation to avoid committing additional resources, they are prepared to admit failure in one of the key objectives before the "Higher Still" proposals are implemented. The Government view is that, if they refuse to recognise a problem, they will not have to do anything about it. That is a recipe for disaster. The Government must realise that adequate resources must be provided. Unless the timetable is realistic, nothing worthwhile will come of the proposed reforms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that that will have a considerable impact on further and higher education. With money following students, there is a push for the first year of university to be taken in further education colleges, which are cheaper. The four-year degree and other unique aspects of Scottish university education are therefore being threatened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government go ahead with their proposals on the advanced higher, the route to higher education will be through a two-year course with a final exam taken at 18 years of age on a narrower curriculum that that which we currently have. That will be closer to A-levels, which has to be regretted, since we pride ourselves on the broard-based curriculum in Scottish education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of teachers' workloads has to be recognised by the Secretary of State. In the past seven or eight years, the educational world has had standard grade, school boards, a vast increase in testing, the five-to-14 programme, devolved school management and teacher appraisal, and now we have the report of the Howie committee, with implications for primary, secondary, further and higher education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before coming to committee this morning, I had a brief chat with one of the primary head teachers in my area. She commits herself not just between 9 o clock and half-past 3, but from half-past 7 until 6 or 7 o'clock in the evening. She said that teachers feel the pace and cost of change to be crucial issues. She said:
	<br><q><p>"At national level there is an expectation that delivery will take place at the same time as publication. There could be a danger of staff and parents being overwhelmed by a plethora of unco-ordinated and unrelated initiatives which could mean non-delivery of the benefits of the five to 14 programme."</p></q>
So the issue of pace of change and cost are at the core of our debate. In addition to those factors, we must consider local authority reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unlike the Minister and the Secretary of State, I went into the education community and spoke to parents, the Catholic Education Commission, the Church of Scotland Education Committee the unions and the special needs group, and asked them how they thought the future of education would be affected by local government reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us examine what the Government are trying to do with reorganisation. They have tried their opting-out process in Scotland and it has not worked. From this morning's paper, I note that the Secretary of State had even disallowed Dornoch academy, from upgrading to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
grade six. The Government have rejected the one school in Scotland in the vanguard of the opting-out movement that went ahead with their wishes. That is an example of the total disaster of opting-out. The Government's political objective for local government reoganisation is the itemisation of schools when coherence and strategic assessments are crucial to educational development. What will happen as a result? I use not my words but those of the umbrella group that has been established to examine education. It believes that
	<br><q><p>"economies of scale will be lost"</p></q>
to local education authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cite to the Minister the example of devolved school management. In practice, I have no objections to it, and I have maintained that stance for many years—as long as it takes the form of a strategic umbrella and there is an opportunity at the area level for an input from the regional authority. Strathclyde regional council education committee tells me that every core team involved in devolved school management requires £50,000 from the centre. However, the Government are doing away with that facility and are leaving schools standing on their own. That economy of scale will be lost as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Strathclyde, more than 20,000 pupils cross boundaries as a result of those changes, and the figure is much higher in the rest of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Smaller authorities with reduced spending power will find it difficult to maintain staffing levels and to provide support services. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury and the Chancellor of the Exchequer tell us that public expenditure has been cut. How can education prosper when public expenditure has been cut? Special needs and nursery provision will be especially vulnerable. All organisations are concerned as a result of this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ken Corsar, the president of the Association of Directors of Education in Scotland, observes:
	<br><q><p>"The finance available will not allow for both local government reorganisation and for an improved Scottish education system. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that Scotland's schools are headed for a period of deep uncertainty, instability and a crisis of morale."</p></q>
It is not the Labour party or any other opposition party saying that, but one of the practitioners and senior managers charged with ensuring that educational quality is maintained and increased over the next few years. However, those results need not have occurred. The Howie committee and the debate that followed provided us with a tremendous opportunity to make a fresh start on the upper secondary school curriculum. It created a sense of excitement. All involved in education were prepared to take a radical look at the current system, which fails too many of our young people, and to ask searching questions about whether it serves adequately the needs of young people in today's society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the Government's best efforts to denigrate teachers, there is a willingness in schools to accept that change is required. The professionals in the system have an interest in delivering a high-quality service and they are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0083">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
prepared to make efforts to bring about that aim. However, the Government must accept that the revolution required in secondary schools can be successfully achieved only through a partnership between the Government and those in the education system. It is the Government's duty to provide the means to allow professionals to shape a system that is suited to the needs of the 21st century. If the Government listen to Ken Corsar and his like, to parents and the different education communities, it is not yet too late.

Let me quote the ancient sage Heracleitus.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Heracleitus, who remarked that change was the only reality. Educationalists and parents in Scotland could be forgiven for thinking that his words of wisdom were a result of a prophetic vision of the ever-changing shape of Scottish school boards, testing, live-to-14 standard grades and so on. Howie's analysis has made it clear that the upper-school curriculum cannot remain immovable, like a stone in a stream, while society changes around it. Heracleitus' remark is apposite because a change of Government is the only reality. When, in the next two years, there is that change, we shall listen to the education community and move forward with it to produce an education system that suits the needs of our young people in the 21st century.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having listened to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, I find the argument of the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall), with his classical references, difficult to understand. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State took great pains to go through the evolution of Scottish educational standards, especially during the Government's term of office, and he talked about a significant injection of funding into the Scottish education system which has to be commended resulting in a significant improvement in the standard of school leavers. However, the hon. Member for Dumbarton talked about the problems of implementing change and about welcoming Professor Howie's report. In fact, he started by praising Professor Howie's recommendations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He ended with him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, he ended by doing so. But, in the middle of his speech, the hon. Member for Dumbarton talked about the difficulties of change and its implementation by teachers. Mr right hon. Friend the Secretary of State clearly said that his proposed changes are evolutionary and that they build upon the existing structure, while recongnising the deficiencies to which
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
professor Howie drew attention. Evolutionary change is far more likely to succeed in a reasonable time scale than dramatic change, such as that proposed by the hon. Member for Dumbarton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I consider the purpose of change and some of the problems that young people experience with the system, especially when entering further education or business, of which I have some experience, I see that many youngsters go through the education system and obtain qualifications that bear little relation to the needs of the outside world, particularly business. Therefore I welcome the changes and the more flexible approach, including the incorporation of vocational training in the higher system being advocated by my right hon. Friend. What my right hon. Friend said about the White paper on competitiveness and the need for British industry to compete in the world and succeed repuires better qualifications of school leavers ones which are more appropriate to today's needs. What my right hon. Friend proposes goes along the correct road to address such problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much has been made of the many changes that have recently occurred in the education system. I am well aware of them, because I have met many primary and secondary teachers in my constituency. Professionals, whether they be lawyers, teachers or doctors, recognise the need to make progress and recognise that change is necessary. Equally, they tend to be most stubborn when change is presented to them. They tend to be most reluctant to accept that change and to build on it in order to go forward. The Government must therefore give a lead to the professions to enable them to chart a course forward in the best interests of all. Obviously, in this case, we are talking about the best interests of pupils. The medical profession presented a similar case when doctors initially strongly resisted the health reforms, but in my constituency, which is in the north-east of Scotland, the reforms are now widely welcomed and are producing significant successes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it extraordinary that the hon. Member for Dumbarton, while clearly welcoming the basic concept of change, does not regret the action taken by the EIS in attempting to block the changes, rather than co-operating. The one thing that I learnt in business is that, if one wants to achieve change and make progress, meaningful discussions, meaningful communication and meaningful co-operation are needed. To do as the EIS has apparently done—to try to block the changes by seeking to ballot its members with a view to non co-operation—is a course of action that I find quite extraordinary especially in the light of what the hon. Member for Dumbarton said about requiring even more radical change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Dumbarton believes that even more radical change will not produce a significant increase in the burden on teachers who, I recognise, are already hard-pressed, he has not addressed the problem at all. It is useless to say that radical change is needed and then to tear apart the timescale, the development programme and the implementation programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The EIS and the teaching profession must knuckle down now and co-operate in discussions. They must put their
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0084">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
experience into the equation to ensure that the outcome is in the best interests of those for whom we provide the service, namely, the pupils and our future school leavers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has achieved a satisfactory balance between recognising the shortcomings addressed by Professor Howie and the recommendations that he has made, and recognising the constraints and difficulties that full implementation of the proposals contained in the Howie report would have brought to the teaching profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yet again, we have heard Opposition Members pontificate on the merits of change and of going forward, but resist that change. I hope that, as this debate continues, Opposition Members will try to encourage the teaching profession and the education unions to co-operate with the Government. The hon. Member for Dumbarton referred to a partnership, but there will be no such partnership if the Educational Institute of Scotland continues on its present course. I also hope that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and my hon. Friend the Minister will recognise that the way forward has to be through co-operation and communication; that the timescale may be tight, but that it is achievable. I hope that we shall go forward in the interests of our pupils and of the future of our country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am sure that you will exercise your powers fairly. I have for many years known you to be a fair man.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Listening to the Secretary of State for Scotland, I thought that it might be very useful, in a certificate examination, to set the question,"Define complacency using the Secretary of State's speech as source material." For example, he took credit for people staying on at school. I can best answer that by quoting a speech made last week by the rector of Culloden academy, Mr. Derek McGinn, in which he said that there were several possible reasons why more pupils than ever were staying on for fifth and sixth years of study. He went on to say:
	<br><q><p>"The first is the non-availability of jobs. The second is that job availability is increasingly linked to qualifications which can be gained by remaining in school. The third is pupil inertia or fear of the unknown."</p></q>
That is much closer to reality. The issue is not simply that the system is more attractive. Pupils do not know where to go, so it is better to stay where there is some safety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
more pupils staying on than the reasons that the Secretary of State put forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to say to the hon. Gentleman that that is an insult to the many pupils who want to better themselves by further education and by getting better, more appropriate qualifications at school that will lead them to better things in later life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note what the hon. Gentleman has said, although he did not have to say it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to concentrate on Howie, as would everybody, but I should like to touch briefly on four other important matters relating to the general background of dissatisfaction among teachers, to which other hon. Members have referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, there is the important issue of the condition of school buildings. I am told that, in real terms, 50 per cent. less is being spent on school repairs than was the case in 1979. The backlog is estimated at £450 million. The Secretary of State's standard excuse is to blame local authorities, saying that it is they who decide how to use resources. Mrs. Alison Marr, chairman of the Millburn academy school board in my constituency, wrote to me:
	<br><q><p>"As you have no doubt gathered from your sons as they have progressed through Millburn"—</p></q>
I quote that letter particularly for the benefit of the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes), who has temporarily left the room. The hon. Gentleman is not the only parent who sends his children to the local school. The letter continues:
	<br><q><p>"Most of the English department is housed in a cardboard city of huts, where conditions are appalling. It is gratifying that the school produces such impressive results in spite of the surroundings which have to be endured by both teachers and pupils. Highland regional council is by no means unsympathetic to our cause, but as you know, they are hamstrung by Government restrictions on borrowing consent."</p></q>
The 	<i>Press and Journal,</i> which I do not think could be regarded as either a liberal democratic paper or a rabid left-wing paper, on 17 June said:
	<br><q><p>"The proliferation of temporary classrooms is the most telling indicator of a flaw in modern education thinking by the Government, for all the fine words … One does not have to work in education to know that investment in a nation's future cannot be skimped. It is that future which is being jeopardised by this remarkable short-sightedness."</p></q>
The same article also says that even
	<br><q><p>"comparatively new buildings are showing the effects of this enforced lack of care. Aesthetically, they are beginning to look tatty. Structurally, they cannot be as sound as once they were. Professionally, they cannot be pleasant places in which to teach or be taught."</p></q>
Some of them were never aesthetic. Ghastly buildings were put up in the 1960s, according to a plan from the Scottish Education Department. Doubtless, some Scottish Office mandarin got a CBE for the design of buildings such as those at Millburn and Kingussie but they are dreadful buildings which now require much attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0085">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
The second matter is cleaning—c-l-e-a-n-i-n-g—and I shall quote again the interesting speech made by the head of Culloden academy in my constituency. Mr. McGuinn stated that the standard of cleaning
	<br><q><p>"has reached an all time low"</p></q>
owing to competitive tendering and that
	<br><q><p>"the system in operation is not delivering the quality of service that was previously provided when cleaning was carried out by regional employees under the control of head janitors.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>Especially in a community school such as Culloden Academy it is vital that cleanliness be of the best. It seems contrary that while services like cleaning have been taken away from local level, schools should be having other responsibilities devolved to them."</p></q>
with £400,000 due to be cut from the cleaning budget of the education committee this year, Mr. McGinn said:
	<br><q><p>"I hate to think what the school will look like in another twelve months."</p></q>
That matter is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, I want to give a short view from the primary section of the secondary education situation. We segmentise and compartmentalise too much. I received a memorandum from highland primary head teacher representatives which states:
	<br><q><p>"In the last ten years we have had an exhausting agenda of reforms and developments including: The Parent's Charter, School Boards, The new 5–14 curriculum"—</p></q>
and so on.
	<br><q><p>"These reforms, while well intended, have been introduced to all schools without their cumulative effect being properly thought out and without taking into account the lean resourcing levels of primary schools. A fair review of resource allocation is long overdue."</p></q>
By that, the representatives mean resource allocation vis-à-vis primary and secondary. They continue:
	<br><q><p>"The pattern of biased resourcing of schools in favour of secondary education—double or even treble—is followed in all sizes of schools and in other areas of resourcing such as equipment, classroom materials and travel allowances …</p></q>
These comparisons are more striking when you learn that in Europe this discrimination against primary education does not exist …
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even with the imminent introduction of Devolved School Management, there has been no real consideration of the criteria according to which schools are resourced. If primary schools are to be treated with the same expectations as secondary schools then the basis of resourcing and staffing of schools should become more objective and reasoned and not treated as at present on historical precedents. We think that it is essential for the good management of schools to see a funding approach to all schools based on 'value for money' and equal status of primary and secondary education."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That matter is valid and it is important to take account of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
Fourthly, a particularly important matter in the highlands is the future provision for Gaelic. The Minister will recognise that Sabhal Mor Ostaig is already well established to provide the Gaelic component of a future highland university. We should by now know how Gaelic-speaking families may express a preference for increased secondary provision in Gaelic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ray Michie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll and Bute)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend surprised, as I was, that the Secretary of State did not mention Gaelic or the requirement for its provision in secondary schools to build on the tremendous success in primary schools with the now 45 units in Scotland? Not to address it in secondary education and highers is a great worry. There is a crisis in the provision of Gaelic teachers, and I know that the Minister who is responsible for education is aware of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend is aware that many pupils have been able to take Gaelic as a subject in their highers, and it has been a tremendous help to them to take the subject in their mother tongue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The short answer is no. The Secretary of State has long since ceased to surprise me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to Howie. Although we agree with Howie's criticism of the current arrangements, we believe that his proposals were too complex and would overload teachers with extra paperwork. We broadly welcome the Government's response to Howie, which focuses on adding to the current system, as opposed to uprooting the whole system. However, we believe that the changes are being rushed unnecessarily with a view to being operational by 1997 and we are worried about the extra work load that the changes will impose on teachers. Earlier this year, the Scottish Liberal Democrats conducted a survey of teachers, which identified stress and work load as the main problems faced by teachers. We believe that there is a case for delaying implementation of "Higher Still".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, I shall deal with lack of resources. The Government have said that no significant new money is required to fund the changes proposed by "Higher Still". That is unrealistic and ignores the fact that vocational and academic learning are being integrated under the proposals for a common examination system. It is generally agreed that education resources are now vastly overstretched and it is difficult to see how the new, advanced higher course will be able to operate properly in an already underfunded education system. Resource is at the root of the matter. We believe that education is being given insufficient and inadequate priority and we would like that to be changed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.46 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you to your new position, Mr. Maxton, and trust that you will find it enjoyable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have clear opinions about why we have schools in Scotland. I believe that schools exist for one reason only; to prepare pupils for the world of today and tomorrow. Schools do not exist for the education establishment. The education establishment exists because we have schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0086">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
Sadly, the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) is not in Committee at the moment. He intervened earlier during the speech of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and seemed to fail miserably to understand that the Government believe firmly in choice. To make the broad assertion that all Conservative Members and their children were educated outside the state system is a travesty of the truth. Certainly, what formal education I had was in the state system. My children have all been educated in the state system and all of them have obtained what I would describe as good degrees. Therefore, I accept nothing from an individual who was not educated in the state system. The humbug and nonsense that one must endure from the Opposition is disturbing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe in choice. When my girls were at school I exercised parental choice, which was given by the Conservative Government. I sent my children to school in Perth and I have never regretted it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the 	<i>Sunday Times</i> of 6 March
	<br><q><p>"John McFall MP, Labour education spokesman, also praised the proposals. 'I welcome the attempt to provide a coherent upper school structure which reflects the wide range of abilities that exist'."</p></q>
I see that the Learned Gentleman also has his photograph in the paper. I can only presume that the hon. Member for Dumbarton has, once again, been nobbled by the EIS and the talk about resources is all to do with the EIS looking for more money for its members. I do not know where resources for the EIS will come from if the Labour party ever forms a government because the Labour party will not tell us. I find that disturbing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend read out the small section before his earlier quote from the 	<i>Sunday Times</i> because I believe that the EIS welcomed the proposals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going to save that for my next point, but I shall do as my hon Friend requested. The article said:
	<br><q><p>"Fred Forrester depute general secretary of the EIS admitted: 'It is quite a good scenario educationally. It meets a number of things we were asking for.'"</p></q>
I wonder whether the hon Member for Dumbarton is calling for revolution. We want what the Secretary of State said—evolution. We do not want revolution in the classroom or where children are concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember from my days at school a speech made by the headmaster on speech day. It made a tremendous impression on me and is as relevant today as it was then, nearly 60 years ago. He said:
	<br><q><p>"A teacher's job is to find out what boys and girls are good at, and make them better."</p></q>
When I consider the people I went to school with, I realise that the school produced good citizens. I put that down to the fact that Lieutenant Colonel Fraser, as he was from the first world war, knew something. I am very proud of Logie school in Dundee which I attended. I am equally proud of the boys and girls who were at school with me because I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
cannot think of one in my class who has not become a good citizen, and that is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I think back to those days, woodwork, metalwork and technical drawing were all important parts of secondary education. It was recognised that the skill level and the technical training of the work force of the world at that time was important. The school trained people for the world as it was. Sadly, we lost our way after the war. I welcome the Government's proposals and the introduction of the "Higher Still" changes. It is an effort to prepare young people through core qualifications and vocational qualifications for the world as it is. The workplace has changed dramatically and substantially. Our job is to recognise those changes and ensure that we prepare pupils for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) said in his speech, which I had difficulty following—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I am sorry but one of the things about communication is that one is heard clearly and understood. I am communicating now and hon. Members realise that I am treading on thorns. I am not doing the hon. Gentleman a disservice. I noticed from the expression on the face of the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) that he also had difficulty following the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is casting a slur on not only the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber but on myself. I understood exactly what the hon. Gentleman said and supported most of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find that interesting. I hope that the hon. Gentleman's face was recorded on television because that tells stories like nothing else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber said that pupils are staying on at school because of unemployment and uncertainty, I asked myself why pupils did not stay on at school in similar numbers in the 1920s and 1930s when world economic conditions were worse. The answer is that the Government of the day did not make the places available or provide the opportunities. The places, opportunities and necessary funds were introduced by this Conservative Government. I am not denying the fact that youngsters are staying on at school because economic circumstances are changing attitudes, nor am I denying that the uncertainties in the workplace are putting pressure on individuals to stay at school. I accept that that is a fact of life. But I am disputing the comments of the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber. Pupils are not simply staying on because of economic pressures; they are staying on because that oppotunity is there. That is what the hon. Gentlemen is missing. I know only too well that in the 1920s and 1930s such opportunities were not there. They are there today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. gentleman should remember that I quoted the local rector of Culloden academy who said that such reasons for staying on were substantial. It appeared to me that they were more substantial than the reasons given by the Secretary of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0087">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
State. I think that the hon. Gentleman accepts that. Of course, one reason is not totally responsible, but to claim that the provision is successful ignores the pressure of unemployment—a very real factor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make two points. First, I know that the hon. Gentleman was reading a letter, but I had the impression that he agreed with it. Secondly, the hon. Gentleman made no attempt to recognise tha fact that we are ensuring that opportunities are available and that we are preparing and training our young people—and will continue to do so under the proposed changes—to be better equipped to deal with the uncertainties in the workplace. The Government are addressing those problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one in the European Union, to which the hon. Gentleman referred, denies that there are massive unemployment problems. At least unemployment is coming down in the United Kingdom. It might not be coming down fast enough to satisfy the hon. Gentleman; It is certainly not coming down fast enough to satisfy me. I want unemployment to come down much more, but I welcomed the trend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the fact that we will introduce a core curriculum into our schools. There will be a basis on which skills required in the workplace can be measured by examinations and results. Individuals will take those results into this uncertain world, about which the hon. Gentleman talked. That should be welcomed, not criticised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to what was said by the hon. Member for Dumbarton. It all comes down to the marvellous word "resources." The Labour party is great at talking about resources. As the hon. Member for Dundee, East will wind up the debate, I hope that he will tell us where the new Labour Government that he thinks will soon be elected will find such resources. I want to know where the money will come from.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On remarks made by the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber, is not my hon. Friend sick to the back teeth of the Opposition's constant whingeing and whining about the lack of resources when local authorities have a responsibility to manage resources and spend them wisely on educational services and assets, such as the renovation of buildings. But Opposition Members constantly say that there is not enough cash. Is not it the case that local authorities have such responsibilities, and the more responsibility they have the more whingeing and whining there seems to be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that helpful intervention. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State drew attention to the massive—over 50 per cent.—increase above inflation in funding for upper secondary school education. We must stop the nonsense of pretending that nothing has happened. Of course, there has been a massive increase and the local authorities have a responsibility. As I have said, the situation has been brought about because the schools exist only for the children, not the educational establishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that the intervention about Gaelic that came
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
from the Liberal Democrats was interesting. I had the impression that today's debate is to concentrate on higher education and is about "Higher Still". [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Just let me finish what I have to say. I am a supporter of Gaelic education, which is why I think that it is important that we draw attention to the fact that substantial resources have gone into Gaelic. I make no apology for that. I am one of those who pressed the Government to do that, because Scotland's heritage is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie) complained that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State did not go into every single detail of whether the Government have provided the additional funding. But why should he? He was talking about broad principles—what was being set out, what was being achieved, the time scale in which it was hoped that it would be achieved, the discussions that had taken place and how the EIS had gone sulky.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dumbarton appears to be in the pocket of the EIS and has changed his mind. He was not in the Room when I addressed the points that he raised earlier, so I suggest that he reads my comments in 	<i>Hansard.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by saying that I greatly welcome the proposals. I believe that they are an honest and genuine attempt by the Government to address what has been a difficult and serious problem, and they have gone about it in the right way. The welcome that was given to the proposals when they were first suggested indicates that rethinking has taken place on that ghastly word "resources", which usually means "I want more money." That is what it is all about; it is not about the education of our children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.01 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to raise three topics, two of which can be disposed of by precise questions. In his winding-up speech, will the Minister say something about the progress of the discussions between Lothian region and the Scottish Office on provision for the disabled pupils whom we discussed during our proceedings, in particular the various specialist services such as the lip-reading services carried out by Sarah Kilbey, Mary Ballantine and others? Since the Committee stage, there has been considerable worry that, at least in those areas that lie outside Edinburgh, the same level of provision will not be provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second topic arises from the excellent speech by the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber, who said all that there is to be said about the crisis in school buildings. I ask only this: do the Government dispute the £450 million needs figure that was given by the hon. Gentleman and that has been bandied around?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third subject is extremely delicate. It concerns the question of research in relation to ovarian tissue. It is proper to raise that issue in Committee because it is arguable that the University or Edinburgh is the leading university in that subject not only in Europe but in the world. There work is being done on ovarian tissue by Dennis Lincoln and a number of his colleagues and they, possibly more than anybody else, are concerned about what occurred in the House on the evening of 12 April.

The Minister may recollect that we had had a long sitting of the Standing Committee which considered the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Bill. When I went downstairs, I was horrified to find that the amendment in the name of the hon Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Dame J. Knight) had been called and was about to be debated. In passing, for the life of me, I do not understand what possessed the Department of the Clerk of the House to allow the amendment on prohibition of the use of cells from embryos or foetuses to be mixed up with the English Criminal Justice Bill. It was entirely out of order, and that opinion would seem to be substantiated by the fact that that the relevant clause was answered by the Secretary of State for Health, not by a Home Office Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Be that at is may, when the hon Member for Edgbaston made her speech, I interrupted her to ask whether she had had any discussions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Earlier the hon Gentleman criticised the Chairman who selected amendments for the Committee. He is not entitled to do that and he is out of order. I should be grateful if he would make it clear that he is withdrawing his criticism of the Chair who allowed that amendment to go forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The last thing that I want to do is to criticise the Chair and so I withdraw those remarks unreservedly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked the hon Member for Edgbaston whether she had had any discussions with the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. I said:
	<br><q><p>"Some people believe that research would be affected. Is the hon Lady absolutely sure that it would not?"</p></q>
The hon Lady replied:
	<br><q><p>"Absolutely sure. I have had discussions with the authority. It knows what my intention is, and why."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 12 April 1994; Vol. 241, c. 158]</p></q>
It is far from clear that any such agreement was given by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. However, my dissatisfaction and horror with what the hon. Member for Edgbaston was up to was as nothing compared to our astonishment when the Secretary of State agreed with the hon. Lady's amendment. I never thought that, in such circumstances, a Secretary of State for Health, late at night and without consultation with the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, which she had asked for a consultation on that matter, would agree to any such amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 24 May I asked the Health Minister:
	<br><q><p>"How come that in January, Ministers welcomed the public consultation that was initiated by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority on donated ovarian tissue, yet come April, they agreed to an amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Dame, J. Knight), apparently drafted in their Department, to the Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill, which completely pre-empted what they had said back in January? What happened to change their minds between January and April?"—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 24 May 1994, Vol. 244, c. 167]</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is straying far from the estimates that we are debating, which relate to education in Scotland, not legislation in the House. I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would return to the subject of our debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall accept your opinion as I am sitting under your chairmanship, Mr. Maxton, for the first time. However, what is of critical importance is the question of inhibition on research or otherwise on the university of Edinburgh. It is an acute problem for those at the forefront of research that has the potential to do great good to the human condition—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that, when I was out, the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) spoke about where I went to school. I know that my hon. Friend went to an English public school as well. Will he confirm that it is not a question of where he and I went to school but of where he and I chose to send our children to school? We chose to send our children to local authority schools because we believe in local authority education. That is the issue. I hope that he will join me in saying that what the hon. Member for Tayside, North said was, as usual, a load of rubbish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confirm my hon. Friend's comment about where we sent out children to school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Garrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley will forgive me if I make two further comments about that research, which is of crucial importance to the university of Edinburgh. I do not expect an answer either from the officials or from the Minister off the top of his head. I plead with them to consider carefully what has occurred and at least to wait until consultation with the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority has taken place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, to what extent can the Scottish Office act separately on that issue from decisions made south of the border? There is every reason why the Scottish Office should act differently, because the research programme of Edinburgh university is affected more than any other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether I should congratulate you on your demotion or promotion, Mr. Maxton, but I wish you well in your new elevated position. I am sure that you will show your usual objectivity in calling hon. Members to speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened with interest to the debate. As hon. Members know, I am greatly concerned about education. It has never seemed strange to me that we should develop education policy, because no policy can ever be set in stone. We are rightly proud of our education system in Scotland, but we cannot rest on our laurels all the time. We should look at developments in the European Union and at how Scottish education will relate to that of our partners, particularly with the accession of four small nations very similar to ourselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we debate education in the Scottish Grand Committee, in Standing Committee or on the Floor of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0089">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
House, hon. Members are asked to be reactive rather than proactive in the development of policy. That does not serve Scottish education well. There is a strong case for members of all parties to sit down together with representatives of the education system, professionals, parents and all interested organisations to evolve a system that keeps us up to date with what is happening elsewhere in the world. We should often step back when looking at education policy and not take an ideological stance such as those that we have heard from various hon. Members today. Changes should be proposed within the context of time scales and funding. The hon. Member for Tayside, North said that the issue was not one of funding, but any change in education requires funding, which needs to be allocated in advance. I discovered that when I was a teacher and the school leaving age was raised to 16.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with much of what the hon. Lady has said, but is her call for a non-ideological stance on education caused by the fact that her party's candidates in the north-east of Scotland have an entirely different ideological standpoint from those put forward in the central belt? They pretend to be socialists in the central belt, whereas they avoid being branded such in the north-east. Is not the ideology of the Scottish National party to be all things to all people?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Member of the European Parliament for the north-east of Scotland had the advantage of being educated in Elgin academy, in my constituency, which continues a good tradition of education in the area. The hon. Gentleman should look at some of the contenders for the leadership of the Labour party and compare their attitudes with that of the Scottish National party. We are much more to the left on educational matters than are some Labour Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So the hon. Lady does have an ideological stance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We also want the training and support of all educational staff and the involvement of our communities. If that is an ideological stance, I believe that it has the general support of the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has centred on the Howie report. My party is concerned that the Government seem to be attempting to bring back a division between academic and vocational education, when my party has always endorsed a comprehensive system and supported that in our local authority work and through our representative councillors and MEPs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will hon. Members listen to the debate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, they are not well educated, Mr. Maxton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within the education system there should be an opportunity for youngsters at all stages of their careers to change the options that are available to them. One of my greatest concerns about the Howie report is the introduction of a division too early—before children have made up their minds and before their parents have had a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
chance to discuss it. Many youngsters whom I taught in the past who planned to the perhaps joiners or plumbers and who would automatically have gone into the vocational side, eventually decided to take academic training. I am not demeaning anyone who takes up a trade, but the division should not be made too early in a child's school career.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to highlight the disquiet in the teaching profession among those involved in training. I have been a member of the teaching profession and have maintained contacts with it. Some teachers in my constituency are personal friends and many of them have told me that if they could find other jobs, they would leave the profession as soon as possible. Such morale among teachers has a knock-on effect. Much of their despair arises from the bureaucractic paperwork facing them. They want to teach children, but instead are faced with mammoth mountains of paperwork, which they may deal with at home, in the classroom or during what are optimistically called free periods but which are never in fact free. The attitude that that is creating in the profession causes me great concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give details of the paperwork to which she referred—the extra burden which teachers must cope with now but have not had in the past?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that if the hon. Gentleman lifts his mailbag as often as I do, he will find that many teachers are deeply involved in standard grade modules which involve much writing by the pupils, under the supervision of teachers, all of which must then be collated into a presentation package. That is far removed from where we were when we spoke about ordinary grades and so on. The standard grade places a lot of additional bureaucratic work on teachers. It does not enhance children's education, although they may benefit at the end of the day, but teachers are finding the work load very difficult to deal with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin O'Neill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clackmannan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady tell us how we can have continuous assessment which is both fair and capable of being monitored without the sort of administrative set-up that currently exists? I have recently attented parents' evenings. One of my sons is embarking on standard grade courses and it is refreshing to see the wealth of information that is now available, but which was not available to parents or teachers when the hon. Lady and I were teaching. The problem seems to be that teachers must have more time for preparation and that requires resources. The difficulty is to create a consensus when at least one side of the political spectrum resents the public funding of education on the scale necessary to accommodate the staffing requirements to which the hon. Lady alludes. To discuss a consensus being established is foolhardy and not even idealistic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman obviously missed my earlier intervention to the Secretary of State when I referred to resourcing and the changes of our education system. If all the staff, including ancillary staff, were given those additional resources, there would not be the same resentment. Teachers are increasingly finding that much of their personal time is taken up, for which they do not receive recognition. I agree that many of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0090">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
developments within the education system are to be welcomed, but we must return to the issue of resourcing. It seems strange to me that, in his opening remarks, the Secretary of State said that examinations dominated school life and that he wanted to see a move away from that, but that the Government are strongly arguing for statutory testing at various stages through school life, rather than continuous assessment. We have already referred to continuous assessment which, as a former school teacher, I endorse and which members of the teaching profession and parents also favour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is making an interesting speech, but I am sure that she would not want to mislead the Committee. I am not suggesting that we should contemplate a move away from examinations. I mentioned in passing the possibility either of the timing of examinations being changed or of those taking advanced highers in S6 not sitting examinations in S5, but those are particular circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Everyone accepts that examinations will always be part and parcel of educational life, but I thought that the Secretary of State believed that examinations should not dominate school life. I want a greater emphasis to be placed on continuous assessment, about which the hon. Member for Dumbarton and I know much because of our training in that aspect of education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State mentioned the advanced higher. Could the hon. Lady shed some light on the Secretary of State's proposal to gather an extra 40 hours from the timetable for the advanced higher?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Anyone who has tried to devise timetables in any secondary school would think it incredible to suggest trying to find an extra 40 hours. I remember being involved in such matters when headteachers and deputy headteachers were tearing our their hair simply trying to organise orderly timetables, without trying to find an extra 40 hours. So I find the Secretary of State's proposal difficult to accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On resourcing, the Secretary of State referred to newsletters that were to be published about the developments in education. How many will be published? How much will they cost? Will the cost be set against the £2 million to which he referred and will it be inclusive or exclusive of that sum? All of us who are concerned about education in Scotland would prefer the money to be spent directly in the system, rather than on brochures, which would be widespread, but not necessarily read or understood. Vote 17 also refers to further education colleges. Little mention has been made of the situation in further education colleges, which surprises me, given the turmoil that exists in those colleges at present. The Government have devolved powers to college councils and yet the conditions and salaries being offered in colleges of further education are being questioned at the highest level. We still face the possibility of strike action later this year. I wonder what the Scottish Office is doing to avoid that. Our colleges of further education have been established as centres of excellence because of the commitment of lecturers over the years to the students and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
to all the changes. I want the Government to ensure that there is a negotiated settlement to avoid disruption and fully recognise the rights of lecturers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, as the votes that we are discussing refer to higher education and to training in general, will the Minister tell the Committee what action the Government are taking on the issue of the College of Nursing and Midwifery in the highlands and western isles and throughout the length and breadth of Scotland? The Scottish Office issued a report entitled "Nursing and Midwifery Education in Scotland—Options for the Future" which indicates the likely changes to nursing and midwifery education. Those changes could pose a threat to the existence of such provision, particularly in the highlands and western isles. Although we welcome this being regarded as a matter for higher education, it seems that the Scottish Office might put training out to private tender and that the 12 colleges of nursing and midwifery in Scotland will have to bid against outsiders for the training opportunities. If there will only be between six and eight contracts, some colleges which are not the subject of contracts will close. That will do a great disservice to the nursing and midwifery profession and to the colleges which have given such useful and excellent service over many years. I should like a straight answer to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.25 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also welcome you, Mr. Maxton, to your new appointment as Chairman of the Scottish Grand Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a good debate this morning. I was especially struck by the emphasis placed by the Secretary of State on the proposal that the changes in "Higher Still" are evolutionary. He was backed up by two of his Back Benchers who also stressed the evolutionary nature of the changes. I think that they will forgive us if we fail to take them seriously when they describe the policies proposed by this Secretary of State as in any way evolutionary. That is the man who has just pushed through the House a Bill that will destroy Scottish local government and which takes the first steps towards privatising Scottish water. He backed the poll tax and supports value added tax on domestic fuel. He is now trying to convince us that his proposed changes to the higher and upper secondary education in Scottish schools will be evolutionary. We do not believe that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cynics might suggest that the stress on the evolutionary nature of change has more to do with the rumours that the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), the Minister of State, Department of Employment, might replace the Secretary of State for Scotland and that it is a blatant attempt by the Secretary of State to save his job. The last thing that the hon. Member for Stirling would claim from the Front Bench is that anything he proposes is evolutionary. He is quite happy to be described as a revolutionary in right-wing terms and would be on that Bench arguing for revolutionary change in Scottish schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reality is that there is nothing evolutionary about the changes being pushed by the Government. They are being rushed through too quickly to be implemented—
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0091">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
properly and the resources to do that are inadequate. The changes are opposed by a wide spectrum of people in Scottish education. That will not be altered simply because the Secretary of State has described the proposals as evolutionary when they are nothing of the kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State was extraordinarily complacent at the beginning of his speech when he referred to Scottish education as being comparable to the best in Europe. The Howie analysis, which he praised, demonstrates that Scottish education cannot stand comparison with the best in Europe. That is why the status quo is not an option and why change is necessary, as both sides of the Committee agree. It has been pointed out that whereas 54 per cent. of 16-year-olds in Scotland stay on in full-time education, that figure is dwarfed by comparative figures for other countries in the European Union which often exceed 90 per cent. Howie described the status quoe in the following way:
	<br><q><p>"As substantial numbers of fifth and sixth-year students are obtaining only one or two highers, a third of fifth year students pass no highers. Many students do not develop good study skills at school and are not well enough prepared for studying for a degree. Provision for vocational education is very poor"—</p></q>
not just poor, but very poor. He continued:
	<br><q><p>"Standards reached in Scotland do not compare favourably with other European countries. Students in fifth and sixth year lack both depth and breadth of study, contrary to the traditional image of Scottish education."</p></q>
To read that analysis and to agree with it, as the Secretary of State says he does, and then to describe Scottish education as comparable to the best in Europe demonstrates a complacency of staggering proportions and proves that the right hon. Gentleman is not fit for the high position that he holds in Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State misled the Committee, whether intentionally or not, about the position of the EIS in relation to the proposals. He said that the EIS summed up opinion about the Howie proposals very well and that it and the Government were at one on that. Those were his words. He told the Committee this morning that it was difficult to see a real difference between the EIS and Government stances. Indeed, I heard a voice behind me shout, "Sell-out". I do not know whether that was a reference to the EIS or the Secretary of State for Scotland selling out, but it is possible to perceive facts that are very different from those presented to the Committee this morning by the Secretary of State. I have the news release that was issued by the EIS shortly after "Higher Still" was published. It argues that the proposed advanced higher
	<br><q><p>"could easily develop into a full-blown A Level, with the narrowing of the upper secondary curriculum which is implicit in that model."</p></q>
The news release also deals with "the 'fast track' for 'a very small number of pupils'". It states:
	<br><q><p>"This proposal would be unworkable in the vast majority of secondary schools and would seriously undermine comprehensive education. It is the EIS view that the proposed 'fast track' is a maverick feature for which there is no educational justification."</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
It continues:
	<br><q><p>"It is ludicrous to pretend that a complete revolution in the secondary curriculum with important implications for the primary curriculum, can be implemeted with minimum extra resourcing. While this may be regarded as a practical argument rather than an educational one, the EIS believes that underresourcing creates its own educational distortions and leads to expedients which are educationally damaging in themselves.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>"The increase in the length of Higher Grade courses from 120 to 160 hours means that pupils will take fewer Higher courses."</p></q>
Finally, of the fast track, which is to be confined to a very small number of pupils, the EIS states:
	<br><q><p>"Once it is established, parents will demand it and there will be 'academic drift'. However, only large secondary schools, typically Parents Charter 'magnet schools', will be able to deliver it. Therefore it will be extremely divisive."</p></q>
To say that there is no difference between that view, as set out by the EIS itself, and the Government's view, is simply wrong. If the Secretary of State does not recognise that, there is something wrong with his ability to read and analyse what unions in Scottish education are telling him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the quotation that I read out from the 	<i>Sunday Times,</i> put out by the EIS, was wrong?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman wants to quote the EIS he should quote not from the 	<i>Sunday Times</i> but from the EIS statements in its own press releases. I have quoted from such a press release, which makes it clear that the EIS disagrees with the Government's "Higher Still" proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State mentioned his decision to establish what he called a high level strategy group, to which three separate task forces would be attached. I did not quite catch the details of each task force's responsibilities. I think that one was responsible for curriculum and assessment, one for staff development and the third for publicity and information. I should be interested to know exactly what the task force on publicity and information will be doing between now and the implementation of "Higher Still" in 1997.I should like to know whether it will be engaged in what might be described simply as political propaganda on behalf of the Tory Government, in an attempt to persuade parents that what is being done is in the best interests of children, rather than in trying to develop the "Higher Still" proposals into something workable. I wonder how much money will be spent on publicity and information under the umbrella of the high level strategy group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State mentioned that the princely figure of £2 million be put aside by the Government for development work and for the implementation of the proposals. That is not much for proposals that will affect every pupil in state upper secondary schools in Scotland. If it is compared with the the money that the Government are setting aside elsewhere in the budget, matters appear very sobering. For example, I understand that £11 million has been put aside to support assisted places in private schools
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0092">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
that are struggling to survive in Scotland. That is more than five times what is being put into developing and implementing the "Higher Still" proposals in all state sector schools. I understand that £1.5 million has been put aside to support those schools in Scotland that have become self-governing. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton pointed out this morning, only one school in Scotland has done that, so £1.5 million of the budget is to help Dornoch Academy, a two-year school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is no trouble.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And that is in trouble. But there is only £2 million to implement all the "Higher Still" proposals. It is ludicrous that a Government should be in such a predicament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The newsletter, Issue No. 1 that was tabled this morning, states that
	<br><q><p>"£2 million will be available for the development programme in 1994–95 with further substantial sums in later years."</p></q>
I suggest the hon. Gentleman reads what is on the Table.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The figures to which I referred for the assisted places scheme and for development of self-governing schools were for 1994–95. They are exactly comparable to the figures given for the higher school proposals. Before the hon. Gentleman intervenes, perhaps he should read the Government estimates on the Table so that he can make realistic comparisons. The point is that the Government are more interested in boosting private sector schools than in properly dealing with the state sector and providing good higher education in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has neatly detractedfrom him original argument. He said that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State had not allocated sufficient funds and he then quoted an incorrect figure. Will the hon. Gentleman recognise that £2 million will be spend this year with further substantial sums in future years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made no reference to the fact that it was £2 million between now and 1997.I said that the sum was £2 million this year. But that sum compares unfavourably with the sums that have been allocated by the Government to other sectors of education which have nothing to do with the vast majority of Scottish children who attend state schools. Their parents' taxes should not be wasted on private education when the state sector is deprived of important funds. Of course; Conservative Members will say that they always expect Opposition politicians to moan and whinge, as was suggested by the hon. member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the opinions of people not sitting on the Opposition Benches who, in a sense, are objective about education. Professor Weir of Strathclyde university, who is not a hostile commentator on what the Government are trying to do in Scottish higher education, says that the intentions are commendable. He mentions the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
practicalities of introducing the proposals contained in "Higher Still" and says that before the onset of mass unemployment, particularly mass youth unemployment, two clear educational routes were available to children in Scotland. The first was an academic route on which children stayed on at school and sat highers with the intention of entering higher education. The second was a more vocational route on which children left school aged 15 or 16 and tried to enter training or work. Their vocational training and educational needs were met by colleges of further education. Professor Weir says that all that has changed because of both the persistence of mass unemployment in society and the Government's proposals contained in "Higher Still". He says that the Government clearly intend that almost all pupils should stay on at school to the ages of either 17 or 18 and that they should do so whether they are pursuing academic or vocational qualifications. Professor Weir says that that has important consequences for comprehensive secondary schools as they have to embrace both the academic and vocational aspirations of their pupils. In his article, Professor Weir states:
	<br><q><p>"The further education college is not an alternative now that it is a private corporation which must sell its services to the highest bidders. Instead, we must look to our comprehensive schools to broaden the base of their staffing so that an increasing number of teachers are recruited with extensive experience in industry and commerce and all teachers are offered regular periods of release to refresh their experience. This also requires these teachers to have their workshops and classrooms equipped to "industry standards".</p></q>
Nowhere in Scotland is there a comprehensive secondary school with such standards or resources to implement the Minister's proposals. Everyone involved in education knows that such standards and resources are required before the proposals can be implemented. That is the argument which the Secretary of State and, no doubt, the Scottish Office Minister responsible for education and housing will fail to address this morning.

"Higher Still" might be a great idea, but great ideas do not work unless money, resources and staffing are put up to make them work at the chalkface in classrooms. That is also true of the implementation date of 1997–98. The Secretary of State first argued that there can be no delay because the present system is not good enough. Coming from a party that has been in Government for 15 years, that is hardly a good argument. The Government have made such a mess of the past 15 years that they cannot allow secondary schools to continue for another three years in their present condition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second argument advanced by the Secretary of State was that the new proposals in "Higher Still" would be based on existing subjects and syllabuses, and that there would be no impact on classroom teachers for at least a year. He did not tell us what the impact on classroom teaching will be in the two years after that. Those arguments are based on total ignorance of what goes on in classrooms in Scottish schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) is absolutely right. Some of us used to be teachers in secondary schools in Scotland and we still have friends and acquaintances who work as teachers. The morale of the teaching work force in Scotland has never been lower in my experience.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>37</span>
Teachers are absolutely sick of the way in which changes have been forced on them by the Government. They are fed up and they want proper resource changes to be introduced with sufficient backing to enable staff to cope with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an article in 	<i>The Times Education Scottish Supplement</i> about the proposals in "Higher Still", Mr. Ian Rose, a teacher at Carver high school in Fort William writes:
	<br><q><p>"The machinery for educational reform in Scotland is out of control."</p></q>
He goes on to say that:
	<br><q><p>"there is no discernible overall strategy"</p></q>
when seen from the perspective of the classroom and that 'logistics are being overlooked'. Mr. Rose writes that:
	<br><q><p>"The workload for teachers is a mjor cause of stress"</p></q>
and that:
	<br><q><p>"Schools do not have the money or the resources to accommodate this rate of change".</p></q>
Professors in universities and classroom teachers at the chalkface are saying that the changes cannot work unless resources are released. The Government are trying to make it work without releasing the resources and that is why Opposition Members are so concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to a document which came to me from my Hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Davidson), who is not here at present, which was produced by four community councils in the Govan area and which was a community inquiry into provision for young people in their area. The councils describe their area as 'less affluent', for example, in the past two decades, the area's rate of unemployment has been 50 per cent. above the regional average for Strathclyde. In 1991, 26 per cent. of economically active people in the area were out of work, and the percentage was higher among males, especially younger males. In addition, 20 per cent. of the adult population could be described as being disabled or longterm sick; 60 per cent. of households depended on some form of income support; 79 per cent. of council tenants received housing benefit; 64 percent. of school age children qualified for clothing grants and 48 per cent. for free school meals; and 80 per cent. of households in the area had no car.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That kind of area should be a priority and should be given additional resources to improve educational opportunities for the children who live there. When the community inquiry averaged the results of the three local schools in the area in the years 1991, 1992 and 1993, and compared the results with those of two schools—Hillhead high school and Williamwood high school—located in more affluent parts of Glasgow, they found that whereas less than 3 per cent. of their children were attaining entry requirements for higher education in their fifth year of school, 20 per cent. of Hillhead's pupils and 30 per cent. Of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
Williamwood's pupils did so. That proves very close links between social background and academic attainment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The community inquiry referred to research carried out at Edinburgh Centre for Education and Sociology in the late 1980s, which showed that 35 per cent. of children from social classes one and two enter higher education as against less than 5 per cent. of children from social classes four and five. The same research showed that where one of the parents in social classes four and five was unemployed, the chances of a child entering higher education fell by a further third, to just 3.5 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the Secretary of State to come here this morning and describe what is going on in Scottish schools as ensuring opportunity for all is a travesty of the facts. In areas all over Scotland, like that in Govan in Glasgow, children and their families live in deprived conditions. Their chances of educational opportunity are shrinking rather than improving under a Tory Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until the Government start to address that sore, which lies at the heart of so much failure in Scotland, huge amounts of human potential will be written off in our country because our education system and our social system are not good enough to allow them to flower and develop as they would under a proper Government and a properly resourced education system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot take seriously the Government's claims that they are interested in education for all. The reality is that they are not. As my hon. Friend and Member for Dumbarton said, only realities change. When there is a change of Government at the next election, a Scottish Parliament will be established, which will properly address the problems of upper-secondary education, with the democratic support of the Scottish people—something which Conservative Members have never had.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was very glad to hear the hon. Member for Dundee, East say that "Higher Still" may be a great idea. It is a great idea, and there is nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was also grateful to the hon. Member for Dumbarton, who was quoted in 	<i>The Sunday Times</i> on 6 March as saying:
	<br><q><p>"I welcome the attempt to provide a coherent upper school structure which reflects the wide range of abilities that exist."</p></q>
Mr. Fred Forrester stated:
	<br><q><p>"It is quite a good scenario educationally. It meets a number of things we were asking for."</p></q>
I hope to be able to reassure hon. Members on many of the points that they have raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make one or two points.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>39</span>
I confirm that we regard education as the passport to fulfilment. We want to ensure that the Scottish educational system involves a caring partnership between teachers, parents, pupils, Government, local authorities and school boards. The Secretary of State and I regard ourselves as the guardians of all that is best in Scotland's educational system, but that does not mean we want to stand still. Education, like high technology, does not stand still, and we have to provide an educational system that is as good as any in the world. That means that every boy and girl should have the opportunity to get to the top if he or she has the ability and inclination. Opportunity for all means opportunity at the levels of each person's aptitude and ability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was glad to notice that one of the aspirants to the leadership of the Labour party received his excellent Scottish education in my constituency. As the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) will appreciate, many things happen in my constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister is so enthusiastic about the Scottish education system for which he is responsible, why does he not entrust his children's education to it? Instead of making silly jokes about where other people were educated, he should tell us where his children are educated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman, who aspires to the leadership of the Labour party, went to a distinguished school in my constituency. I am glad about that. The hon. Member for Clackmannan (Mr. O'Neill) asked me why I did not send my children to Scottish local authority schools. I did. They went to North Berwick primary school, which was an excellent school. We on this side of the Committee believe in parental choice—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Where hon. Members send their children to school is not relevant to the estimates. I would be grateful if the Minister would return to subject of the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to mention that you once taught in an independent school, Mr. Maxton, but that is not relevant either. Developing vocational skills is enormously important, as hon. Members have pointed out, I have had the opportunity to go with the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) to Glenrothes college, which is an excellent further education college. We shall seek every opportunity to enhance the status of further education colleges in the provision of skills and training as qualifications for jobs. We shall leave no stone unturned on that, because we believe that they perform a valuable role in the Scottish education system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Worthington 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clydebank and Milngavie)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No I want to make a point about staying-on rates, which have cropped up a lot this morning. The staying-on rate between S4 and S5 now stands at 73 per cent. Over and above that figure, a further
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
7 per cent. go to full-time courses in further education colleges. We want to build on that substantial achievement. Many more people have better qualifications than ever before. There is more parental choice and more and better information. The range of opportunities is greater than ever before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More than 3,000 national certificate modules are available as a result of the Government's action plan. A great deal has been and is being achieved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister turn his attention to the excellent point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East? The Howie analysis found the system to be quite good for the most able pupils. However, the Minister is talking only about "Higher Still". What will be done to equip and resource secondary schools for the vocational start that they need in order to deliver for those for whom the current education system is not delivering?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises the issue of resources. He has heard that, from 1994 to 1995, £2 million is to be provided. As to extra resources for authorities, education authorities and headteachers will decide what choice of courses should be offered in their areas and how they should be taught, taking account of local needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We see no reason why the new system could not be delivered within local authorities' existing resources. However, I confirm that, as the development work progresses, we shall consult local authorities about plans for delivery of the new systems, and we shall take their comments into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie and many other hon. Members, including my hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch), raised the issue of the speed of implementation. The hon. Member for Dumbarton expressed concern about that matter and suggested that it would take two years. However, it will take at least three years. We believe that that time scale is realistic, achievable and desirable. The development programme will provide all the support and guidance necessary to introduce those changes within that time scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, changes to course content will be kept to the minimum. There will be continuing support for teachers during the early stage of implementation. We shall consult authorities about their detailed plans for implementation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend accept that if the EIS tries to boycott those changes, that timetable could be tight? Will he take every measure to ensure that the EIS is urged strongly to support and co-operate during that period?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we seek to have an educational system as good as those anywhere in the world, that aim will not be easy to achieve at all stages. We believe that the time scale is realistic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Moray raised the matter of newsletters. We regard their publication as an important
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0095">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>41</span>
means of keeping teachers and other interested parties informed of developments. We have made sufficient copies available to authorities for every secondary school teacher in Scotland. Copies are on the Table, and we shall publish further newsletters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber raised the issue of cleaning, which comes under devolved school management. At least 80 per cent. of expenditure identified will be devolved, including, at least, expenditure on staff, furniture, fixtures, supplies and services. The points that the hon. Gentleman raised should be dealt with by the devolved school management service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Argyll and Bute raised the issue of Gaelic. I have strongly supported the funding of the addition to the Gaelic college on Skye. We have received 100 submissions about Gaelic from organisations and individuals. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will announce our future plans for Gaelic education in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber raised the matter of proposals for a highlands university. We would have to satisfy the rigorous criteria that are applied throughout the United Kingdom, and it would be premature to existing and future developments for the Government to endorse proposals for a highlands university at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the significant subject of school buildings, this year the Government made available £71.5 million. We had evidence from the audit unit stating that the standards and quality of Scottish schools' accommodation is rated satisfactory in the majority of primary and secondary schools. We shall be examining the issue with particular care in the public expenditure survey round in the autumn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On special educational needs, raised by the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell), the duties will remain under section 1 of the Education Act 1980 that each authority must secure the special educational needs for their own area. Those duties are extremely important. A further obligation is laid upon authorities to make provision for special educational needs, and we shall keep a close eye on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On ovarian research, which goes slightly beyond the ambit of the debate, I shall examine the points raised by the hon. Member for Linlithgow in relation to Edinburgh university and write to him. Likewise, I shall write to the hon. Member for Moray on the issue of midwifery.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry but I shall not give way to the hon. Gentleman; I have other points to cover. I promise that I shall look into the matter and write to him about Edinburgh university. The point that he raised is obviously a major House of Commons issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dumbarton raised the issue of fast-tracking. I confirm that we have provided a framework to help schools to ensure that pupils progress at their own pace, whatever their level of ability. Obviously,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
there must be an appropriate solution for a child, regardless of his or her level of ability. The decision to allow standard grade credit presentations at the end of S3 simply removes an unnecessary barrier to the progress of a small minority of pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In respect of intake to post-school education institutions, the new qualifications will not discriminate against mature entrants who prefer the highers route into higher education. Several higher education institutions already accept a substantial proportion of mature entrants and offer a range of access courses and qualifications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about the implications of a four-year honours degree course. It is possible that entry to higher education by students holding the new advanced highers could, exceptionally, be into the second year of a particular subject course in a degree. That would, of course, be for individual universities to decide. Exemption is likely to depend on course structures and requirements, but by no means will all students entering from S6 necessarily wish to study at university only a subject in which they took advanced highers. It is worth bearing in mind that many students with A-level qualifications neither seek nor wish for exemptions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was also asked about teachers work load. I have made a statement, and I want to make it clear that I shall do everything in my power to help teachers in that connection, but we have to work within the framework of what is possible. We have eased the time scale in respect of the five-to-14 development programme, school development plans and devolved school management. We have started more research into discipline and we will monitor the pace of the training programme for introducing modern languages. We are extending teacher representation on advisory bodies and we shall be having a round of meetings with teachers unions in due course. Those actions go some way to meeting the points that have been raised. Much of what the EIS has called for has, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said, been delivered by "Higher Still".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to teacher work load, I can say only that it is a matter of regret to me that some representative bodies chose to take a rather hasty view, but I am extremely pleased that those representing parents' interests in school matters saw much to commend in the statement on teacher work load.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the few seconds remaining to me, I confirm that the proposals will provide opportunities for all to aspire to the best qualifications of which they are capable and to gain the skills and abilities to play a full part in society. I have every confidence that our proposals will build on the success of the past, because they are in tune with people's educational needs and aspirations. I strongly commend "Higher Still" to the Grand Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
