First Scottish Standing Committee</div> <!-- title -->
<time>Thursday 24 March 1994</time>
<p><i>(Morning)</i></p>
<p>[MR. MICHAEL J. MARTIN <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>Local Government etc. (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. We are about to discuss clause 61, which is the first clause in part II relating to water and sewerage.<br><br>
Earlier this week in Strathclyde, the largest region in Scotland, a referendum of the electors was held and 79 per cent. of those who cast their vote in a 71 per cent. poll disagreed with the Government's plans for water <i>[Interruption.]</i> In fact, more than 97 per cent. cast their votes against the Government.<br><br>
I know that that is not a matter for you, Mr. Martin, but I suggest that it would be premature for the Committee to consider this part of the Bill. The Government will want time to reconsider their views on the Bill in the light of the referendum result and statements made by Conservative councillors at the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities conference at Dunblane yesterday.<br><br>
In the light of these facts: a desire on the Government's part to examine the strength of public opinion in Scotland on such a crucial issue; and a belief that the Government would want to consider seriously what the people have told them in such decisive terms, I hope that it will be possible to accept a procedure motion that would delay consideration of this part of the Bill until later in Committee.<br><br>
I seek your advice, Mr. Martin, about whether you would be willing to accept the following motion:
<br><blockquote><p>That the remainder of the Bill be considered in the following order, namely, Clauses 121 and 122, Schedule 12, Clauses 123 to 162, Clause 61, Schedules 7 and 8, Clauses 62 to 65, Schedule 9, Clauses 66 to 76, Schedule 10, Clauses 77 to 91, Schedule 11, Clauses 92 to 120, Clauses 163 to 166, Schedules 13 and 14, Clauses 167 to 169, new Clauses, new Schedules.</p></blockquote>
I ask you, Mr. Martin, to consider accepting the motion so that the Committee can properly consider this serious matter after the Government have had a chance to reflect on the wounding message that was given to them by the people of Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood <span class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. I strongly support the request by the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson). The appropriate response from the Chair, if I may ask you to consider such a response, would be to allow the Committee time to digest the significance of the referendum.<br><br>
Even those who were sceptical about Strathclyde's decision to hold the referendum—I confess that I was one—never in their wildest dreams expected such a response. It is deeply significant and has a direct effect on the Committee's consideration of this part of the Bill.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1424</span>
The proposal by the hon. Member for Hamilton is sensible. It does not delay anything, but will allow better consideration of part II of the Bill. I strongly support the plea for the motion to be accepted. I hope that you, Mr. Martin, will consider accepting it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. Given that the Chair has considered today's business and prepared an appropriate timetable, did the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) make any approach outside the Committee Room to give you, Mr. Martin, fair warning so that serious consideration could be given to the matter?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No one sought advice from me outside the Committee. That is not the way that I conduct my affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh <span class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. I also lend my support to the hon. Member for Hamilton—<i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Let the hon. Gentleman speak.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin.<br><br>
Our system is supposed to be a representative parliamentary democracy. A delay would allow the Government to consider how best they can represent the Scottish people rather than ignoring their views. It would also give the Government time to consult their supporters, let alone anyone else, and it would allow for proper consideration of the issues by the Committee. I hope that you will accede to the request by the hon. Member for Hamilton.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Sir Hector Monro)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. I hope that you will not accept the proposal by the hon. Member for Hamilton. We should proceed with consideration of the Bill as we have agreed. We shall hold extensive debates, particularly on clause 61 stand part, and they will enable both sides to put their arguments. The Committee will then be able to reach a decision on clause 61 stand part.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hamilton has tabled a motion on the order of consideration and asked for my ruling. The rules of the House and of the Committee allow me to make my own judgment. I shall accept the motion on the order of consideration and allow it to be debated, but not for a great length of time. That should be borne in mind. I expect the debate on the motion to last no more than an hour.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the remainder of the Bill be considered in the following order, namely, Clauses 121 and 122, Schedule 12, Clauses 123 to 162, Clause 61, Schedules 7 and 8, Clauses 62 to 65, Schedule 9, Clauses 66 to 76, Schedule 10, Clauses 77 to 91, Schedule 11, Clauses 92 to 120, Clauses 163 to 166, Schedules 13 and 14, Clauses 167 to 169, new Clauses, new Schedules.</p></blockquote>
I congratulate you, Mr. Martin, for responding in that way to the views of hon. Members. I am sure that you will have noted that Conservative Members were not terribly enthusiastic in opposing my motion. We know that there is good reason for that.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1425</span>
Following their initial shock at the result of the Strathclyde referendum, Ministers came out with a variety of statements, some of which they will live to regret. As the Prime Minister would say, they are prone to saying things in the heat of the moment that they will have reason to regret. Again, like the Prime Minister, they will withdraw their remarks after they have given them further consideration.<br><br>
The unique consultation with the electors of Strathclyde on the proposals for water services was entered into with some bravery by the elected councillors of Strathclyde region. I firmly believe—I am not alone in the Committee or outside in doing so—that that consultation has remarkably changed not only the political climate in Scotland, but the political climate inside the Conservative party.<br><br>
Acceptance of my motion would create a delay that would give the Government the opportunity of looking with care at why they repeatedly find themselves on the losing side when public opinion in Scotland tests their proposals. The referendum in Strathclyde merely confirms what we knew about the Government's unpopularity on this and many other issues. However, its significance is that no one—and perhaps not even the architects of the referendum—sufficiently appreciated the depth of feeling about the proposals for water supplies.<br><br>
People are asking us as their elected representatives and the Government, who represent only 11 parliamentary constituencies in Scotland, how they can get their voice heard in a democracy. How can they be heard on a subject that is of such deep and fundamental importance to them? They tried to be heard at the general election at which the Conservative party returned only 11 Members of Parliament in Scotland and they have tried at local council elections in which the Government are continually and consistently humiliated.<br><br>
The message of the opinion polls is that 95 per cent. and more of the population are opposed to the Government's proposals on water supplies. We know that those gross figures, which are published daily, cover a vast majority of Conservative supporters in Scotland who share our views on this matter. English Members have no real clue about the mood in Scotland although, having served on this Committee for 120 hours, they may be beginning to detect that they are not only on the losing side in Parliament when it comes to votes among Scottish Members, but on the losing side of the argument about the substantive issues before the people of Scotland.<br><br>
In a democracy, people have a right to ask how to get their view across and how to get the Government to respond. The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) may be sitting in Committee, signing his correspondence, apparently oblivious to the views being expressed. But he, of all people, cannot run away from the fact that in his own constituency, where he clings on by his fingertips, the result this week is a hammer blow to him. Not only are the borders of the new gerrymandered audiority that he has created for himself endangered by the result in the by-election in Ralston last week, but a thunderous 20:1 majority this week against his views on water should make any sane man—especially any sensitive politician—think, deep down, that he may have got it wrong. It is quite incredible.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1426</span>
We have heard recently from Conservative politicians elements of a belief that perhaps they have not always got it right. The Secretary of State for Scotland, whose presence we are not graced with in this Committee—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is the Opposition's fault.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that it is our fault that the Secretary of State is not on this Committee. We should get this absolutely clear for the record. When it was arranged to have a Committee with a majority of one, arithmetically reflecting the balance of the House of Commons, we did not knock off the Secretary of State for Scotland. But a Tory had to go, and the general chose to desert the battlefield.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have allowed an order of consideration motion. We must be very firm and keep to that motion. The make-up of the Committee is outwith the bounds of the motion. I must start as I mean to finish regarding the motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I would not like this to be on the record without the facts being known. The Secretary of State could not serve on the Committee because of attending Cabinet meetings on Thursday mornings. That is well known by all right hon. and hon. Members and has always been allowed for by members of any reasonable Committee, with the exception of the hon. Member for Hamilton.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The record will stand, and I do not intend to develop the point. However, I wonder what the Secretary of State is going to Cabinet to do. Let us hope, on diis of all Thursdays, that when he goes to Cabinet in about five minutes from now, he will take with him the results of the Strathclyde referendum. He should take that test of public opinion to his Cabinet colleagues and say, "We have got it wrong." The Committee can vote to have an adjournment to allow the Secretary of State to persuade his Cabinet colleagues that their policy has so fundamentally lost the support of the Scottish people that perhaps even this Government—unthinking, uncaring and careless as they usually are—could turn their back on their past and listen to the people for the first time.<br><br>
On 12 March, <i>The Guardian</i> ran a profile of the Secretary of State, in which he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"And in exercising my powers I'm conscious that although I am part of the majority party in Parliament, I'm part of a party that is not in the majority in Scotland, and therefore a measure of circumspection, of steering with care, is I think appropriate."</p></blockquote>
"Steering with care" is a bizarre description of the Government's conduct over the past 15 years. However, if that represents a change of heart, the Secretary of State must look at the signs and listen to the voices of public opinion and turn away from the policies in part II.<br><br>
If the Secretary of State wants to listen to public opinion and act with circumspection, even though he does not listen to Opposition Members, he must surely to goodness be willing to listen to Conservative voters in Ayr, in Eastwood and in other constituencies who voted almost without exception against the Government's policies on water.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1427</span>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Atkinson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hexham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman had £750,000 to spend on a referendum, would he hold one on the restoration of capital punishment in Scotland? I speculate that an overwhelming majority of people in the west of Scotland would want capital punishment to be restored. If that were the case, would the hon. Gentleman then vote for it? He has consistently voted against it so far.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that that would be the outcome of a referendum on the restoration of capital punishment. Even in snapshot opinion polls, the figures do not suggest that. The Strathclyde referendum was held as part of a legal process. That consultation with the electors took place within the law and the current powers of local government. Local authorities have not just a legal right, but a duty, to do that.<br><br>
Those of us who were fainthearted about the risks involved are right to be contrite. The councillors of Strathclyde were not content simply to stand back and say, "We know what our electors want. We know we speak with authority. We know we speak on behalf of the people." They went out and asked the people themselves. That was a political risk and might have involved a legal risk. However, the councillors believed that the voice of the people was important. Had the referendum result been different and produced a response that supported the Government's proposals, Conservative Members would have been dancing up and down, telling us with great glee that the electors of Strathclyde had endorsed the Government's plans.<br><br>
This is not just an ordinary referendum result, an ordinary test of opinion or an ordinary snapshot. There was an unprecedented turnout of 71.2 per cent., whereas the turnout was 40.44 per cent. for the 1990 regional council elections and 61.7 per cent. for the high-profile 1975 referendum on our remaining part of the European Community. Of the people who turned out in the Strathclyde referendum, 97.2 per cent. rejected the Government's plans. That is unambiguous and there can be no question about it.<br><br>
I appeared on "Newsnight" the other night with the Secretary of State for Scotland in a rare opportunity to debate the issues with him. The Secretary of State's first argument was that the referendum was meaningless. We have heard before the Conservative party's contempt for the electorate. That is why it has only 11 seats out of 72 in Scotland. His second argument reflected his briefing by all those clever people, whom we are not allowed to mention in the Committee, on the arguments to put forward on high-profile programmes such as "Newsnight". The second arrow in the quiver was to say, "What about the half million people who did not vote?" Even if all those people existed and were on the electoral register and every one of them posted a referendum form in which they had stated that they backed the Government's policy, the Government would still have lost.<br><br>
The Government were elected on about 40 per cent. of the vote for the United Kingdom as a whole, on a turnout only slightly greater than that for the referendum. They speak with authority, run the country and are making challenges even in Europe, but they describe a poll result
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1428</span>
of 97.2 per cent. as meaningless and argue that we should be concerned only about the people who did not vote. That sets an interesting precedent.<br><br>
If we should decide to be so generous as to permit a delay in the consideration of part II of the Bill, what should the Secretary of State and his colleagues outside the Committee do? I suggest that they should chat to the Conservative councillors who are at Dunblane today. One would have thought that the first instinct of a political party that is fighting for its life, with an opinion-poll rating of 13 per cent., might be to consider its residual supporters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roger Knapman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stroud)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is about to come to the Government's aid, it will be the first time in the past fortnight.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Knapman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the people in the pubs and clubs of Glasgow talk about nothing but who operates the local sewage works.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is disgraceful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Knapman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the hon. Gentleman's speech last year about referendums, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"On a whole series of issues, if people were asked whether they would like a referendum, they would say in almost the same proportion that they would like a referendum."</p></blockquote>
He continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"However, if that is to be the principle on which we base the judgments we take, what will there be left for us to do?"—[<i>Official Report,</i> 21 April 1993; Vol. 223, <i>c.</i> 464.]</p></blockquote>
Does the hon. Gentleman stand by last year's speech or by what he is saying now?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I stand by last year's speech and I am sure that if the hon. Gentleman had time he would read out the rest of it. We should hear in its proper context what I said about a referendum on the Maastricht treaty. I could develop that subject now, if there was time. If the Government were willing to listen to the people, there would have been no need to hold a referendum in Strathclyde. If the Government had a real notion of what even their supporters are loudly and clearly telling them, Strathclyde would not have had to spend £700,000 of council tax payers' money on permitting electors to express a view in an organised and fair way. If the Government or Parliament wanted to listen, there would be no requirement to carry out such tests from time to time. However, as I pointed out to the Secretary of State, who tried to make the same feeble comparison with what I said last year, there is a great difference between putting to the electorate the consideration of a hugely complex treaty involving 30 or 40 separate issues, and putting to it the simple issue of the Government's proposal on water and sewerage.<br><br>
If the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Knapman) really wants to judge Scottish public opinion on the issue, instead of making cheap comments in Committee—a practice that will do his party in Scotland no favours—let him come up to Dunblane with me tomorrow.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0792">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1429</span>
<i>[Interruption.]</i> I remind the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch) that his cheap comment implied that people in Scotland, including those who voted in the referendum, were not concerned or knowledgeable about who runs the sewage works. They have shown that they are. <i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We must have calm. The Committee must allow the hon. Gentleman—and anyone else who is making a case—to speak.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In a spirit of amity—because I should like, through the order of consideration motion, to allow the Government to back off from a suicidal policy which manifestly, from all the evidence, will damage them and their reputation in Scotland—I want to tell the hon. Member for Stroud that he should come with me tomorrow to the conference of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, where he can meet councillor Ian Hutchison of Eastwood district council. The Minister, the hon. Member for Eastwood, is still busily engaged in his correspondence, hiding his head. Councillor Hutchison is quoted in today's <i>The Herald</i> as saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"The board members should be directly responsible to the local electorate. I don't believe it is good enough for the Secretary of State to say that they are responsible to him and through him to Parliament."</p></blockquote>
Those are the words of one of the last remaining Conservative councillors in Scotland. The hon. Member for Stroud does not have to listen to me: although we shared views last year we probably disagree on everything else. Let him come to Scotland and find out why 97 per cent. of the population of Strathclyde voted against the Government's proposals. He can speak to others too.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Tayside, North could also listen and learn something.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that that is true. If the hon. Member for Hamilton listened he too might learn something. Does he seriously believe that what he is doing at the moment helps the debate? We have the opportunity, if we could only get on with the clauses and the amendments, to debate these issues. The line taken by the hon. Gentleman during the debates on the Maastricht treaty was that Parliament should debate matters fully. I happen to agree with him, and I look forward to taking part in the debate on water.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Parliament is debating the matter. This is Parliament. This is a parliamentary Committee. I am not seeking to destroy the clauses on water in the Bill although I think that the Government should abandon it. I am not asking them to back off instantly—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. Let me answer the hon. Member for Tayside, North.<br><br>
That is not what I am asking at the moment. The Bill is flawed and wrong and should be scrapped, but that is not what I am moving at the moment. The hon. Member for Tayside, North voted with me on many occasions last
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1430</span>
year. He should listen vary carefully. We are asking only for a moment of consideration by the Government to take into account the view of the people expressed this week in the referendum. If the hon. Gentleman cares to vote with me again at the end of the debate, his Government will have a chance to listen to Councillor Ian Hutchison and to Councillor Jim Evans from Berwickshire district council who said that he hoped that the Government would now agree to that change. All I ask is that he and the Ministers listen to these views.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon McMaster <span class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend leaves the subject of Councillor Ian Hutchison I should like to quote Mr. Hutchison's comments as reported in <i>The Scotsman.</i> It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"If the Government does not yield, COSLA agreed to call for a national referendum on the issue.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Speaking after a meeting of the COSLA Conservative group which significantly agreed not to challenge the Labour motion, its leader, Ian Hutchison, said individual Tory councillors had made clear their view that a majority in the new local authorities would be elected councillors.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Mr. Hutchison said that his own council had made that known to its local MP Allan Stewart.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valid point. I hope that Conservative Members are listening to our modest suggestion that consideration of the Bill should be altered to allow the Government to listen to the views of Conservatives across Scotland. Even the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) is quoted in today's papers as telling reporters that the Government should perhaps consider again whether elected councillors should be there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I made one comment on television which I do not retract. I said that the Government should give us guidance about looking again at representation on the committees. I made no other statement to any newspapers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is enough, and it is sufficient to sway the hon. Gentleman to vote for the motion. We are not yet asking for a full-scale retreat, although that is what the Government will have to do if they are not to be wiped out in the regional elections on 5 May or find themselves in the same ignominious position as Kim Campbell's Tories in Canada in the European elections on 9 June. The motion before the Committee is simply that we reorder the Committee's business to allow the Governrnent to listen carefully.<br><br>
Let us again listen to Councillor Ian Hutchison. I build this argument not simply on the views of 97 per cent. of the Strathclyde people who turned out in the referendum but on the views of seriously concerned and worried senior Conservatives in Scotland, who are petrified about the message. The Minister sits here, quietly dealing with his correspondence. If the party factotums are allowed to make such statements, one or two faint hearts in the party will inevitably want to pack public utility bodies with elected councillors. The words of Erich Honecker and Todor Zhivkov will come back through the mists of time. Whoever those anonymous, faceless, unmentionable people are who say such things, they do no favours for a Government who are fast running out of time.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
Councillor Ian Hutchison said:

<br><blockquote><p>"I think they should respond".</p></blockquote>
He added:
<br><blockquote><p>"I don't know whether they will or not."</p></blockquote>
We want to give the Government adequate time to reflect on the importance of the measure that they propose. It is right and proper to consider the Bill's other provisions before we discuss that measure. I do not accept that, in that unique and historic referendum, the people of Strathclyde were misled. I do not believe that the electors of Eastwood thought that they were voting against privatisation of water. Many probably realise that if the Government proceed with this measure, privatisation is what the Government will eventually want. However, a general election will stop that, long before it reaches that point.<br><br>
It is contemptible for the Government to suggest that, when the people are consulted and when they speak, the people do not understand. People understand only too well; they voted in parliamentary and local council elections and now through this unique referendum they have said, in effect, that they do not want the Government's proposal; they do not want Scottish water to be quangoised; they want the Government to scrap their plans.<br><br>
I ask the committee to vote for the motion, to allow the Government the chance to listen for the first time, to the Scottish people, so that it is not the last time that they have a chance to listen to them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak against and shall certainly vote against the motion. In my view, the Committee should get on with the serious work of discussing, first, the principles behind the Government's proposals. Those principles have not been properly, fully and adequately debated inside or outside Scotland.<br><br>
I understand the stance adopted by the Opposition. It was in their interest to present the picture that the Government would privatise Scotland's water and sewerage systems. That has been the Opposition's practice and policy, and they have consistently taken that line.<br><br>
I regret that we have not privatised water. I have never made a secret of why I think that we should do so, but that is not what the Government propose. Therefore, I want to get down to the serious business of debating the principles behind the proposal and how the necessary funds are made available to bring Scotland's water and sewerage systems up to the levels required to meet the standards in European Union legislation and the United Kingdom's health and safety legislation, as well as the growth requirements of almost every town and village in Scotland. That is why the issue is important. Anyone who, like me, is concerned about the inability to get new homes built in places in my constituency such as Aberfeldy and Blair Atholl knows that the need for new sewerage works is delaying matters.<br><br>
The issue is where the necessary funds are to come from. They can come directly from the taxpayer, partly or indirectly from the local tax payer, or from the consumer. It is the consumer who is desperate for the additional facility.<br><br>
The consumer pays through the usual methods of raising capital. That is what we all do when we go out and shop in the high street. High street shops raise funds for buildings, staff, stock and everything else through the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1432</span>
private sector funding of the city. There is nothing wrong with that system. It works extremely well for Marks and Spencer and for everyone else in the high street. There is no reason—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I greatly respect the hon. Gentleman, but we are talking about a procedural motion to change the order of business. What has that got to do with the consumer in Marks and Spencer?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are debating a motion of some tension. I ask the hon. Gentleman to let me chair the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the fact that you, Mr. Martin, recognise the importance of addressing the Labour party's reasons for putting forward a proposal to delay debate on the principles contained in Part II. They are asking that debate be delayed so that those principles can be addressed more fully, as they say. I am saying that the principles should be addressed by debating the amendments. They give us every opportunity to debate every aspect of what the hon. Member for Hamilton said: whether councillors should have a majority on the new ruling bodies and whether they should or should not be part of those bodies.<br><br>
Those are important issues that the Committee should be getting on with, just as we should be addressing the problem of finding the money needed. Even COSLA, which supported the referendum, got its figures wrong. To bring services up to standard requires £100 million per year, year after year. I do not hesitate to say that that money is best obtained through private sector funding and paid for by the consumer.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Paisley, South (Mr. McMaster) points to the badge with 97 per cent. on it. I did not want to talk about that issue this morning because I felt that it was a tender one which it was better not to mention. I am not ducking the issue, but I do not want to get into areas that may cause further rifts. I am happy to talk about the massive misrepresentation that has been carried out. Everywhere I have gone, people have said to me, "You are going to privatise water and sewerage." I say that, regrettably, we are not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson <span class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a copy of the voting paper that was circulated to all the people in Strathclyde. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Government proposes that from April 1996 water and sewerage services should be provided by a West of Scotland Water Authority, with a separate Customer's Council. The members of both bodies will be appointed by the Secretary of State… Do you agree with the Government's proposal"?</p></blockquote>
Some 1.1 million people voted no, and only 33,000 voted yes. Does he think that those figures, from an independently conducted ballot, have no significance? Would not the Government be wise to pause for thought?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have often listened to the hon. Gentleman talking about presentation, particularly on a Scottish Parliament or Assembly. I know that I am digressing, Mr. Martin, but I have listened, down the years, to the most appalling rubbish, and he has spoken rubbish today.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0794">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1433</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Kynoch <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman did not tell the whole story. I have here a Strathclyde Labour party document headed, "Strathclyde Water Referendum". Below the word "vote" is a box marked "No" with a cross against it. It then states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Save Your Water</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>No Water Quangos</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>No Privatisation</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Put Your Vote in the Post NOW"</p></blockquote>
Does my hon. Friend believe that the referendum was attended by a full and open debate which stated clearly to the people of Strathclyde what were the cost implications for them of the Government's proposals and whether those proposals meant privatisation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his helpful intervention. I have the same document and was about to link it to the nonsense that we have heard from the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) about a Scottish Parliament. The case for that has also been misrepresented on a massive scale. The plain truth is that, if the publicity material that was distributed had been sent out by commercial organisations, they would have been had up for fraud.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman read out a leaflet from Strathclyde Labour party that said no to water quangos, which is what the Government propose to introduce. The leaflet also said no to water privatisation. We firmly believe that setting up quangos is the first step towards privatisation. There is no hypocrisy or fraud about saying that.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman should pay attention to the facts. If he thinks that there was no debate about the referendum, that is down to the incompetence and complacency of the Conservative party. Labour sent out leaflets, and his party did not.<br><br>
Is the hon. Gentleman saying that 97 per cent. of people who voted, in a poll in which more than 70 per cent. of the electorate turned out, do not understand the issue? Is he saying that only he and his party understand the issues? That is the key point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They understood. I have never suggested that people did not understand the message that was being put out by the Labour party, which said vote no to privatisation. That is what the leaflet told them to do. It is no surprise that they responded as they did. Quite properly, they were saying that they did not want privatisation.<br><br>
If I understand the hon. Gentleman correctly, he is arguing that the Government's proposals are a halfway house to privatisation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should wait to hear my speech. The proposals do not mean privatisation, and I do not see them as a halfway house because they would not be a viable halfway house.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend believe that the Labour party made the slightest effort during the referendum campaign to discuss the funding required for water and sewerage? My hon. Friend referred earlier to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1434</span>
development of villages in his constituency and his pertinent point applies also to my constituency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The plain truth is that the Labour party did not do that. COSLA got that wrong in the material that it put out, and COSLA, as we know, is the Labour party at prayer—it is praying for a better future. It got the sums so grossly wrong that it suggested that the local government tax would be £2 per person per household, or something like that. That is nonsense, because £100 million is needed every year, year after year. The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) shakes his head. Is he suggesting that the figure is not £100 million a year, year after year?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am shaking my head because the hon. Member does not know what he is talking about. He said £2 per person per household: that is a meaningless phrase. I do not know whether he means per person or per household. He has not answered the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian. Every person received a ballot paper which was honest and true. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the people of Strathclyde were so stupid that they could not read the ballot paper and did not understand which way they were voting? Is he saying that one and a quarter million people in Strathclyde are stupid and do not understand the issue?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does me a great disservice. He knows that council tax is the responsibility of one person per household—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Answer the question.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asked me a question about my statement and suggested that I did not know what I was talking about. Council tax is the responsibility of one person per household, so £2 per person per household was the correct description of what will be required. The hon. Gentleman should have listened to what I said instead of blowing his top.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked whether the people understood the questions on the ballot paper. My answer is that the people understood the questions as far as they went. They had been bombarded with misinformation. At every opportunity—we have heard it this morning—the Opposition say, "This is privatisation." It is not privatisation. It is anything but privatisation. The Government have given serious thought to the question of how to raise the huge volume of funds necessary to provide facilities in villages and towns throughout Scotland. Until the Labour party consider properly, fully and adequately where those funds are to come from, who will pay and how the matter will be dealt with, it is perpetrating fraud on the people of Scotland. That is what Opposition Members would be doing if they tried to sell goods in contravention of the legislation that covers the sale of goods and services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Knapman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As it appears that not only were referendum papers provided, but that certain information from the Labour party was provided, does my hon. Friend believe that the Labour party should contribute something towards the cost of holding the referendum?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0795">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1435</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the council acted within the law, and I have no complaint about it, but we may want to consider whether holding a referendum is a wise use of public funds and then write our conclusions into the Bill. One of the things that I have been considering is how to write into the Bill provisions to meet occasions when councillors make a demand on the local tax payer for such a level of expenditure on referendums, which might be considered by Parliament not to be the way in which to run things.<br><br>
During the passage of the Maastricht treaty Bill, the hon. Member for Hamilton argued eloquently against referendums, and I accept his honourable and honest view. He said that he believed that certain matters ought to be determined by Parliament, because that is what Members of Parliament are elected to do, and that they ought not to be put to the people in a referendum. It seems contradictory for the hon. Gentleman to use a referendum only when the result will come out in his favour. It reminds me of General de Gaulle. Under our parliamentary system, which I accept, much as I wish it were different in some respects, referendums are not the way in which we normally conduct our business.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Will you clarify whether it is possible to have a time limit on speeches, given that there is a limit of one hour on this debate? I know that several hon. Members want to speak and I do not want a filibuster from the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am guided by the Standing Orders and I cannot restrict the length of hon. Members' speeches. I said, however, that I would not expect the order of consideration motion to be debated for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. Am I right in thinking that the debate started at about a quarter to 11, so that there are about 25 minutes of it left?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It started at 10.37 am, but hon. Members should remember that a closure motion can come only from the Committee. I said only that I would not expect the debate to run for more than one hour, but the matter is in the Committee's hands, not mine.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure you, Mr. Martin, that I am not conducting a filibuster. I would not dare. I am trying to address the various points raised by the hon. Member for Hamilton in support of his motion, and to give my reasons for believing that that motion should not be supported.<br><br>
We have to consider the principles involved, but the hon. Gentleman does not want us to do that. Privatisation was just one of eight proposals put forward by the Government, but, of course, it was the one on which the Opposition concentrated exclusively.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman argues that we should go ahead and debate the principles, but does he agree that we can do that only if we debate the amendments that have been tabled and that acceptance of the order of consideration motion would allow the Government time for cooler thought and to table amendments that are more in tune with the majority of Scottish opinion?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1436</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to demonstrate to the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) and other hon. Members that we should not accept the motion because the amendments that have already been tabled give us an opportunity to debate in detail and at length the very issues that the Committee are being told the Government should take away and reconsider.<br><br>
It is my experience of Committee work that a lot of time is spent, quite properly, debating contentious matters. As the amendments that have already been tabled address all of the points raised by the hon. Member for Hamilton, we already have the opportunity to discuss in detail whether the new water bodies should be constituted as they are, whether they should be different, whether they should be organised and structured differently, whether they should have councillors on them and whether those councillors should be in the majority.<br><br>
I think that the order of consideration motion is a political charade, rather like the labels that Opposition Members are wearing this morning. It is an attempt to make the most of a particular situation at a given time. I do not deny that other parties would probably do the same if they were in opposition, but we have to see it for what it is. We must not be diverted from the reality, which is that we already have the opportunity to debate in detail every single matter that the hon. Member for Hamilton said we needed extra time for. We debate matters here in the Committee, not outside.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman speaks of misrepresentation. I asked that the Government go away and consider the issues. With the greatest respect in the world to the hon. Member for Tayside, North, he is not the Government. He is not at Cabinet this morning. Even the junior Ministers here in the Committee do not have the capability—even if they had the necessary sense of survival—to make the change in policy that is now required to satisfy the will of the Scottish people. We are asking today for a chance for the Government to take the matter away, to reflect on it and to come back with Government amendments that represent what the people of Scotland are saying.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not need to be told by the hon. Gentleman that I am not the Government. I know it only too well. If he reflects back to last year he will remember that, unlike him, I carried my view along the Committee Corridors on a mattter of conviciton, even though I was under considerable pressure that, one day, I shall write a book about.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that, while he is not the Government, neither is the hon. Member for Hamilton? Does he concede that he has much more chance of being in the Government that the hon. Member for Hamilton?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Unlike the hon. Member for Hamilton, I chose not to be a member of the Government. That is the difference. In the unlikely event of his being a member of the Government—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Come on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have tried not to be diverted. I am responding to the hon. Member for Hamilton. I believe
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0796">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1437</span>
that I have addressed the issues that he raised. I made a note of them as he made them and I have responded in detail to each of them in turn. I must inform the hon. Member for Hamilton that I am about to sit down. I was about to do so before he intervened. If, at some future date, he is a member of a Government, he will realise that, in Committee Governments frequently change legislation at the will of the Committee. That has been happening in this and almost every other Committee along the Corridor during the past few weeks. Does the hon. Gentleman never read what goes on elsewhere? That is the purpose of Committees, and it is why we are here this morning. I think that we should reject the motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. You will have noticed that several hon. Members on both sides of the Committee want to participate in this important debate. The substance of the debate is the fact that, of a 71 per cent. turnout, 97 per cent. of the people who voted said that this is a matter of interest and significance to them. When hon. Members on both sides want to speak, when the overwhelming majority of people in Scotland want to hear what the Committee has to say and, most important, when they want the Government to change their mind, an hour's debate is, frankly, too short. Is there any possibility of your reconsidering your decision so that this significant matter can be properly debated?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an order of consideration motion. There will be other opportunities to talk about water and sewerage, regardless of how the vote goes. Hon. Members know—as a Back Bencher, I also know it—that some hon. Members will be disappointed, but it should be borne in mind that I can put the question only if I receive a motion from the Committee. I know that Ministers and Opposition Front-Bench spokesmen will want to speak, as will members of the two minority parties. I am also aware that there are Back Benchers, who want to speak. I shall try to be even-handed and call as many of them as I can. Now that the debate is in progress, it is for the Committee to decide how long it should last, but it is not normal for an order of consideration motion to be debated at length.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. I should like to check that my memory is not out of kilter. Did not you advise the Committee a few moments ago that you were not empowered to stop the debate and that the length of the debate was in the hands of Committee members? Is it in order to ask the Chairman to repeat himself?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Elletson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Blackpool, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On this one?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Elletson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me deal with this one first. I shall explain the Standing Orders to hon. Members. I cannot stop the debate, but I can use my good judgment when an hon. Member asks that the Question be now put. I shall do that. I have allowed the motion to be debated, but it should not be debated for a long time. I can only explain
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1438</span>
things that way: I hope that I do not have to repeat myself. We are, however, eating up our time with points of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Elletson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. May I draw your attention to an extremely sinister event? The hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) has disappeared and all that remains in his place is a sign saying "No". Is that not like the referendum— <i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The background noise is unhelpful. How can I listen to a point of order when other hon. Members are interjecting? There is nothing sinister in an hon. Member leaving the Committee Room. The Chairman does not have the power to force people to sit here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to respond, Mr. Martin, to your exhortations to make progress. Some of the hon. Members who spoke earlier took advantage of your wise decision. I recognise that it was a difficult one to take and that you were under pressure. However, it would be grotesque if the Committee did not respond to the referendum given the astonishing return of ballot papers and the extent of support for the proposition that the Government's proposals should be abandoned. I hope that the views of the other minority party and other hon. Members will be heard briefly on this constructive dilatory motion.<br><br>
The motion merely seeks to move consideration of part II of the Bill to a later stage of our proceedings. The case for doing that is overwhelming given the referendum result. Everyone, including Opposition Members, should pause and take stock and consider where the public debate has left us. The referendum was of crucial significance and it transcends the narrow issue of the subject matter in part II. It raises questions about the democratic process.<br><br>
If we seriously suggest that the referendum, the way in which it was conducted and its results can be ignored or set aside, we shall send a significant message that the electorate—not only in Strathclyde, but throughout Scotland—will take to heart. It will make those who are interested in these matters not just sceptical about the Government's proposals, but cynical and disillusioned. They will feel disenfranchised from the machinery of government.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Tayside, North said that he was not happy with the Government's proposal and that it was a half-baked scheme. We look forward to his votes reflecting that opinion. If the hon. Gentleman is unhappy, he should try to make the Government change their mind. He said that people have been hoodwinked about privatisation. I was prepared to give the Government the benefit of the doubt on that, but they then commissioned the Quayle-Monroe report and thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money was secretly put in a cupboard. The Quayle-Monroe report made it crystal clear that, to achieve privatisation, a three-board structure was necessary on which no local authority representatives would serve. The Minister shakes his head. There is an easy way for him to disprove that. He should put a copy of the report in the Library and let us read it. If the hon. Members for Tayside, North and for Ayr have influence with the Government, they should put that idea to the Minister.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0797">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1439</span>
If the Quayle-Monroe report goes against privatisation, I undertake to reconsider my suspicions about what the Government are doing. The people of Strathclyde made clear their thoughts about what the Government are doing.<br><br>
When the margin for error is considered, the System 3 poll that was carried out in the rest of Scotland translates neatly into the same bracket of result as the Strathclyde referendum. There is a test of democracy that the Committee cannot ignore or run away from. The least that we can do is tell the Government that there are things that they can do; they do not even need to abandon their whole prospectus. They could come forward with measures, which I would be prepared to examine with care, to make joint boards, put local authority representatives on them and to give those boards the authority to raise money on the commercial market. That deals with the point of the hon. Member for Tayside, North about the necessary finance.<br><br>
Everyone knows that financial problems exist and that money has to be raised. It does not matter a docken leaf where it comes from, but the Government are using an ideological agenda to push forward a privatisation system that suits their own book. There are other ways of doing things. If there were local authority representation on the boards and if they were given the power to raise money on the markets, the Government would get to almost where they want to reach while achieving accountability and gaining the necessary finance.<br><br>
What is wrong with the current system? The Government should explain the need for change. What is the motor for these ludicrous and unwanted plans? If they do not agree to retain the status quo, there is a range of options which they should consider. If they did so, they could come up with a mechanism that would suit both sides of the Committee and deal with demands that are being made as a result of the referendum.<br><br>
The Committee has to be careful about the vote. If we vote against taking more time to examine the issue in further detail, we will fly in the face of 97 per cent. of the biggest region in Scotland. That would be a disgrace.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Given your time restraint, Mr. Martin, I do not intend to speak for long. When the hon. Member for Hamilton moved the motion, he constantly used the terms "Strathclyde" and "Scotland" as if they were one: Strathclyde has spoken and the rest of Scotland automatically has to fall into line. Indeed, in the final sentence of his speech, he said that the people of Scotland had spoken. The people of Scotland have not spoken; the people of one region of Scotland have spoken. Of course, that represents two fifths of the population of our country, but two fifths is a minority, and 71 per cent. of two fifths is an even smaller minority.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hamilton is misleading the Committee and those who will read the report of proceedings if he is suggesting that Scotland has spoken. It is hardly surprising that he used such language because not one official Opposition Member represents a constituency north of Dundee. The rest of Scotland does not matter to them. Strathclyde rules as far as they are concerned.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hamilton talked of local democracy. In my constituency there are 27 local councillors at region and district levels. Of them, 14—a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1440</span>
majority—are Conservative. In my constituency, a majority of elected councillors and the Member of Parliament support what the Government are doing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is not giving way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I tell my councillors in my constituency—they form a majority of the elected representatives in the seat—that the proposal is being abandoned, they will ask why. I will say, because Strathclyde has spoken. That is no way to run Scotland.<br><br>
The argument of the hon. Member for Hamilton was also incoherent. Conservative Members have long championed much of what he has said on constitutional matters, much to his chagrin and the animosity of his hon. Friends. Until today, we respected his arguments about the sovereignty of this place. He has, during his time in the House, made a principled stand on the sovereignty of Parliament. He failed to get elected to the shadow Cabinet, after I do not know how many attempts, because he could not command a majority of his Scottish colleagues who were unhappy with his stand on the constitution. When they talked of a referendum, he slapped them down. During the Maastricht debate, he led his troops into the lobby at 3 o'clock in the morning so that the media would not pick up that they were voting against a referendum. Now we are told that a postal referendum in Strathclyde matters more.<br><br>
In challenging my hon. Friend the member for Stroud to read the rest of the debate, the hon. Member for Hamilton was trying to get himself off the hook. I have a copy of the debate, in which the hon. Gentleman said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I make the point that many others have made in the debate. Those who cry loudest about Parliament handing over sovereignty to Brussels … happen also to be those who are most keen to hand over sovereignty, on this and probably many other issues, to the rule of the plebiscite." [<i>Official Report,</i> 21 April 1993; Vol. 223, <i>c.</i> 464.]</p></blockquote>
If that view was right on 21 April 1993, why is it wrong on 24 March 1994?<br><br>
The incoherence of the hon. Gentleman's argument is astounding. To abandon principle and to play fast and loose with the constitution of our country, which he has long defended, for cheap party political points and to hold together the coalition on the Opposition Benches is shameful.<br><br>
The motion is not about the future of water—it is about the future of the constitution. That is why it must be rejected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is amazing that Conservative Members are dismissing the votes of 1.2 million people in Scotland—half the Scottish voting population. If the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson) allowed a vote in the other half of Scotland, the result would be very similar. If he believes that the Scottish people did not speak in that referendum, he will be in for a great shock when they speak again in May and June, using exactly the same voice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty <span class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that the report on the consultation process from the Scottish Office, points out that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0798">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1441</span>
number of responses coming from Grampian was 14 per cent. of all responses? In fact it states that they contributed more per capita than any other region and it was in rejection of the Government's proposal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is not just an ordinary event. Something very important has happened in Scotland and the Government would be wise to stop, look and listen. They should consider what has happened before they plough on with the Bill. If time is running out for me in this debate, by definition it is running out even faster for the Government. They would be very wise to grab this opportunity to rearrange the business of the Committee. That is what the motion is about. It does not stop debate on water—far from it—but rearranges the business of the Committee. It does not change the timetable, but merely proposes to alter the order of running—we will still have debates on water. However, it would allow the Government to absorb what the Scottish people said in the referendum.<br><br>
We will learn at the end of the debate whether this is a listening Government. We may learn exactly how they listen, with a result of 12 votes to 11 as the inevitable English majority is trundled out to defeat any suggestion other than the Government's. I am afraid from what I have heard that it sounds like 12:11 time again. I have heard some sick jokes about the orchestra happily playing on the deck of the Titanic, but I have never seen anything like this before.<br><br>
The Government should take the opportunity for further thought about a Bill that it being plagued by rush and hassle to get it through. This is yet another example. The Bill has a tight timetable, and the Government would be wise to grasp the lifebelt that it is being offered to them, othewise they will sink without trace.<br><br>
The fundamental argument is one of democracy. This is supposed to be a representative, democratic system. Well, the people have spoken. The views will not be represented until the Government reconsider their proposal. We are not delegates; we are meant to be representatives. If Conservative Menbers look at what their constituents said in that referendum, it should not only give them pause for thought, but make them ask the Government to take time and allow the matter to be debated properly in the light of what the Scottish people have said. A vote of 97 per cent. against the Government's proposals is not a small matter. It is a massive, overwhelming view of the people, which must be taken into account. It represents all sections of the population and cuts across all parties. Any delay in debating part II of the Bill would allow time for further reflection and cooler reconsideration of the matter. The Government have time to stop, look and listen before they are fatally run over.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
The Government do not represent Scottish opinion on what is purely a Scottish issue. I should like to stress that. This is a purely Scottish matter. It does not affect any other part of the United Kingdom. On this issue, the Government's views do not reflect, in no shape or form, the wishes of the Scottish people. The Government have no electoral mandate. Through this referendum it is now
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1442</span>
plain to see that they do not take into account the view of the people.<br><br>
The motion represents a lifebelt to the Government. They would be wise to grasp it. They have quite ruthlessly used their in-built, English majority 55 times on this Committee dealing with a Scottish legislation. If they choose to do that again today they will make a massive mistake.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I am offered a lifebelt by a member of the Scottish National party or Labour Members I must really consider why they are offering me it. If it was offered by the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley I would want a written guarantee before I decided to use it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was only an opening remark.<br><br>
I shall certainly vote against any motion suggesting that we postpone dealing with water at the present time. I want to talk about it and about local authority representation. I will not, however, be talking about local authority domination when we reach the real debate.<br><br>
It would be churlish not to recognise, however, that the referendum has been a tremendous public relations exercise by Strathclyde regional council. The message has got across to the public. As my hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside revealed, judgment has been formed on criteria other than the relative reasons which he behind the question. Strathclyde's legal adviser advised members of the Lab-Lib pact when they were putting it together that the referendum
<br><blockquote><p>"misses the opportunity of seeking to find out positively what the public wants".</p></blockquote>
Those advisers also suggested that the outcome of the referendum
<br><blockquote><p>"would be of relatively little constructive value".</p></blockquote>
That advice was given by Strathclyde's legal adviser.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: So what?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point made by the legal adviser is that the question did not give an honest presentation of views and certainly, in the way that the campaign was run, did not result in a total judgment that can be applied to the views of the people of Strathclyde. I accept that there is a message there and I accept that it would be foolish to close our ears to it. The referendum must be put into perspective and it must be considered when we get down to the real debate which I hope will not follow on too long after this motion has bitten the dust. Questions must be asked when we hear Opposition Members comparing this referendum with such referendums as those on Europe and, in 1979, on the Scottish constitution.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. The hon. Member for Ayr has just read out what he claims is legal advice to Strathclyde region about the referendum. I know that we have no Law Officer present and that that sometimes places us at a disadvantage, but perhaps the hon. Gentleman could make it clear that the legal advice that he read out related to a referendum by way of manned polling stations, and not to the referendum that Strathclyde ran. The hon. Member for Tayside, North
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0799">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1443</span>
freely acknowledged that that was carried out to the very letter of the law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is nothing to do with the motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The information from which I quoted and on which I said that I had been advised, came from a Conservative member of Strathclyde regional council. Given the emphasis that the hon. Member for Hamilton has placed on the views of Conservative councillors, I should have thought that he would respect and accept that information. I accept it in good faith. [HON. MEMBERS: "Apologise."] I have nothing to apologise for. I stick to the words that have been submitted and to my presentation of them.<br><br>
I want to say more about the Electoral Reform Society's method of setting up the referendum. I recognise that one paper was sent to each individual named on the electoral register for all of the constituencies in Strathclyde, but the exercise cannot be compared with other referendums—in 1979 or on the subject of Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because, during those referendums, individuals were subject to checks to ensure that on each issue it was an individual vote that was recorded. There is no guarantee of that in the referendum that we are discussing. There is nothing to show that, if half a dozen envelopes were delivered to a household, one person there did not fill them in and submit them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I note that my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton referred to a Law Officer, but I want to ask whether it is not a disgrace that the Government, who will not accept the verdict of 1.2 million people, comprehensively rubbish and challenge the integrity of Strathclyde regional council. That is utterly disgraceful and the hon. Member for Ayr should withdraw his allegations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was not a point of order. The hon. Member for Ayr must have been in order, otherwise I should have called him to order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin. It would be helpful if the hon. Member for Fife, Central, would open his ears and interpret other hon. Members' words more accurately. I did not criticise Strathclyde in any way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman rubbished Strathclyde.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I challenge the hon. Gentleman to find words in <i>Hansard,</i> when the debate is printed, that will show me to have rubbished Strathclyde.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not give way. The hon. Gentleman will have a chance to justify his remarks when he has read <i>Hansard.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not give way. Labour Members and my hon. Friends want to take part in the debate if time allows.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1444</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have made it clear that I will not give way. I think, Mr. Martin, that if the message has not got through to Opposition Members, it has certainly got through to you. I shall conclude my remarks shortly.<br><br>
If referendums are to be held and if Strathclyde is awash with money—as it appears to be, given the £750,000 that it has put into its referendum—I challenge it to run a referendum on capital punishment, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) suggested. The outcome of that would be revealing and I should probably be able to align myself with it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McAllion <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I strongly support the motion tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton. I understand that your acceptance of that procedural motion, Mr. Martin, is unprecedented—that in Parliament's entire history, such a motion has never before been accepted. In the circumstances, which have never before arisen in Parliament—your decision is justified. The people of Scotland have made clear their views on water and sewerage services, which the Committee is attempting to defy.<br><br>
The Minister suggested that he will recommend that the Committee does not accept the procedural motion. That means that he, as the Minister responsible, his fellow Ministers and Conservative Back Benchers are saying to the Scottish people that they are prepared to ignore a referendum result in which 1.25 million Scots expressed their views. They are not even prepared to defer consideration of the clauses on water and sewerage services to give themselves time to reflect on the outcome of that ballot.<br><br>
The day after the results of the ballot, they are showing that they are determined to go ahead with their proposals regardless of what people in Scotland think and without taking time to consult their party supporters in Scotland. They are determined to get this part of the Bill on the statute book. I suspect that that is because they are frightened to go back to Scotland and to consult people outside Strathclyde and find out what the rest of Scotland thinks about the provisions. If given the opportunity to express their views, people in the rest of Scotland would say the same as the people of Strathclyde. Knowing the regional councillors in Scotland, I suspect that those people will be given that opportunity and that this is not the end, but the beginning of the story.<br><br>
The Minister said that we should debate the motion, hear both sides of the argument and then make a decision. However, we know already what the decision will be; it has been taken even before we hear both sides of the argument. I was in the Chamber a few Fridays ago to discuss the Water (Domestic Disconnections) Bill. One of my hon. Friends introduced that Bill to prevent people in England and Wales who could not pay their bills to water companies from being disconnected. The hon. Member for Stroud was the main speaker against that proposal. He said that water companies need to have the power to disconnect consumers from water supplies.<br><br>
Should the people of Scotland trust the hon. Member for Stroud? Will he listen to the debate and say, "People in England and Wales should be disconnected, but not people in Scotland. Yes, there should be private water companies in England and Wales, but not in Scotland"?<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0800">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1445</span>
Will he pretend to do anything other than prepare the ground for privatisation in Scotland, just as he voted for the privatisation in England and Wales that he still supports?<br><br>
The hon. Member for Tayside, North thinks the same. He regrets that the Government are not going straight for the privatisation of water. If he were on the Front Bench, we should be debating proposals for direct privatisation of water and sewerage services in Scotland. It is nonsense to believe that Conservative Members will listen to the arguments and then make up their minds. The only Member representing a Scottish constituency who might have been persuaded to change his vote has been deliberately kept off the Committee—the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir N. Fairbairn). He is not reliable. He may actually vote in line with his conscience and will not do what the Whip tells him. The Conservative Members are on this Committee only because they are slaves and will do as they are bidden. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Therefore, we cannot expect serious—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. There must be no noise from the Gallery. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I suspend the Committee for five minutes.</span></p>
<p>11.58 am</p>
<p><i>Sitting suspended.</i></p>
<p>12.5 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Emotions are obviously running high inside and outside the Committee. That is hardly surprising because emotions are running high in Scotland. Other hon. Members have referred to the fact that no one here expected such a high turnout in the Strathclyde referendum or the result that was obtained. The Committee should listen to the people of Scotland. I hope that we shall do that when we vote on the motion.<br><br>
Conservative Members should remember that water is an emotive subject in Scotland. The hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Knapman) made a joke about people in Glasgow bars dicussing water and sewage. In Scotland, water has always been seen as a symbol of social progress. Not one member of the Committee can remember the days when houses did not have clean water supplies or proper means of sewage disposal. Even the Minister is not old enough to remember those days, but we can read about them in the history books. Most of us know of hotels in our cities that used to be cholera or typhoid hospitals. In the days when there were no clean water supplies, Scotland's cites were scarred by outbreaks of cholera and typhoid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not give way to the hon. Gentleman. He filibustered for a long time earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Tayside, North did not filibuster.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1446</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Sorry. The hon. Member for Tayside, North blethered for far too long for most Opposition Members.<br><br>
Initiatives taken by local authorities provided clean water supplies to cities and created proper sewerage systems. That transformed public health in Scotland once and for ever. In the 19th century, when much of that pioneering work was done, local authorities were not all that democratic. As democracy advanced in the 20th century, however, they came under democratic control. They have continued to provide the water and sewerage services that have ensured that the people of Scotland do not have to worry about water-borne diseases. That system works; it continues to work and that is why people feel emotive about it.<br><br>
Conservative Members have argued that the Government's position has been misrepresented and that they do not propose privatisation and disconnections. I remind Conservative Members of what happened in England and Wales. Water services did not move directly from local authority control to privatisation. The first step was to set up quangos—the water authorities. Water and sewerage authorities were taken from local authority control, given to quangos and then, several years down the line,the Government moved to direct privatisation.<br><br>
People in Scotland undertstand fully the Government's intentions. The Government realise that they cannot move to outright privatisation at this stage, but they are preparing the ground. That is what the water authorities will do. The Government must be made to think again because they will not be allowed to privatise Scotland's water. People in Scotland have sent that message loud and clear. Conservative Members representing Scottish constituencies should realise that.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South suggested that 1.2 million people in Strathclyde are a minority and do not represent Scotland. What does that make those people sitting on the Conservative Benches? They are a minority who do not represent the people of Scotland. In the previous general election, three out of four voters voted against the Conservative party and yet a Conservative Government have been imposed on us. Every test of public opinion, whether it be opinion polls that show the Conservatives with 13 per cent. or 14 per cent. support in Scotland or results in general or council elections reflects that fact.<br><br>
I recall the time when there were Tory councils throughout Scotland, but there are not so many today. A once great party that could command a majority of votes in Scotland in an election has been reduced to vying with a Trotskyism separatist party—Militant in Glasgow—to see which forms the major opposition to the Labour administration there. The Conservatives have been reduced to that in Scotland. It is time that they listened to what the people in Scotland say.<br><br>
Conservative Members say that they do not want to be governed by referendums—although, in the past, some have supported referendums, incuding the hon. Member for Tayside, North. He is happy to argue for a referendum when it suits him, but he is not happy to support one when the outcome does not suit him. I have consistently supported referendums, and will always do so, but I do not want to be governed by them. I want to be governed by democracy, but that is missing in Scotland. That is why
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0801">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1447</span>
we are having this debate and why it is so fundamental and important.<br><br>
I do not for one moment believe that anyone was duped by the Labour party in the Strathclyde referendum or that constituents—who not so long ago voted for many of the hon. Members on the Conservative Benches—were duped by Labour propaganda. Let us consider the referendum results for constituencies that are not known to be Labour held. In the constituency of the hon. Member for Ayr, 93 per cent. of those who voted did so against the Government's proposals; 41,557 people in the hon. Gentleman's area said no to what he will vote for this morning. The hon. Gentleman had better understand that they will remember how he votes this morning when he seeks re-election. The same applies to the Minister, the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart); 95 per cent. of the people who voted in his constituency—that is, 41,650 people—voted against his proposals to change how water and sewerage services are delivered in Scotland. The Minister will have to face those people, in the knowledge that they will have rumbled what he did this morning and what he has done throughout our proceedings.<br><br>
I want consideration of the clauses to be deferred, but not because I believe that the Government can come up with a patchwork scheme to cobble the Bill together. If water and sewerage services are to remain under the control of local authorities, as the people in Scotland want, the whole Bill must be scrapped. That is the message that is coming from Scotland.<br><br>
Tayside and many other regional councils decided not to hold a referendum of the kind that Strathclyde held. Those hon. Members who, like me, do not come from Strathclyde must appreciate that if the Committee ignores the outcome of the Strathclyde referendum, I promise that every regional council in Scotland will examine how the Committee conducted itself this morning and will decide that there is only one way to combat the undemocratic practices in this institution. Referendums will therefore be held in Grampian, Tayside, Highland and in Lothian. We shall then hear the voice of the people of Scotland and that process will be unstoppable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This interesting debate relates to an important part of the Bill. There is, obviously, heated opinion in Committee and throughout Scotland on the subject of Scotland's water services, and so it should be. It is an important service and the very life blood of the nation.<br><br>
The comments made on the referendum in Strathclyde have misled the Committee somewhat. I know what discussions have taken place in my constituency on the future of water services. At the forefront of their desires my constituents want a high quality water system delivered to them, wherever they live, and also the best quality effluent treatment.<br><br>
There is an equal realisation in my constituency—which has a fast growing population, due to the economy of the area—of the need for reinvestment and further investment to be able to cope with the expansion within that area. My constituents therefore regard it as necessary that there be a debate on how best to fund that investment. The quoted figure is £5 billion of capital expenditure on water and sewerage services in the next 10 to 15 years. That has to be found somewhere—in my view at the least possible cost to the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1448</span>
consumer and, equally, in a way that does not prejudice rural consumers compared to city consumers.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
Those points were not put to the Strathclyde electorate who voted in the referendum. Comments about delaying consideration of this section of the Bill so that further thought can be given to the matter are utter nonsense and represent political manoeuvring.<br><br>
I have a copy of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State's consultation paper "Water and Sewerage in Scotland. Investing For Our Future". It is dated November 1992. Considerable time has been offered to allow public opinion to be expressed on the issue. Public opinion on the structure of the water authorities was clear. The Secretary of State recognised that in the summary of the responses to the consultation paper. Paragraph 4.1 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Most responses (84%) came from individuals. Preponderantly they expressed opposition to privatisation."</p></blockquote>
That discussion with the public is past. The Secretary of State has reacted to it in his proposals.<br><br>
I believe—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not give way at this point. We have discussed the matter for some time. I might give way soon, but shall continue my remarks for the minute.<br><br>
I was elected to the House to discuss the details of legislation in the best interests of my constituents. We are discussing a complex structure and dealing with a significant business that requires to be set in place to ensure that the best possible service is provided at the least possible cost. If the existing structure—</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is naive to the fact that we are reorganising local government; we are therefore reorganising regional government. Structures that can provide water or effluent treatment services will no longer be—</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to continue. The Opposition have had plenty of say. They have put their views strongly and in a one-sided way to the people of Strathclyde. They have not invited the people of Strathclyde to consider the cost options of the alternative to the existing method of water supply or of effluent treatment. The people of Strathclyde are similar to the rest of the people of Scotland, who want services to be provided in the most cost-effective way.<br><br>

<p><span class='member'>Several hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is not giving way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members do not like the fact that we intend to discuss fully the issues in the debate. We shall put forward the views—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Committee is developing into a shambles. We cannot have such a situation. If the hon. Gentleman says that he is not going to give way, he is not going to give way. [HON. MEMBERS: "He said that he might."] He may have said that, but he is not going to give way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Was he telling a lie?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Withdraw that remark.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The question—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Withdraw the remark.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that he was telling a lie; I said,"Was he telling a lie?"</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman will withdraw that remark.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can I not ask a question?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will withdraw the remark.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to withdraw the remark under your instruction, Mr. Martin, but the hon. Gentleman should give way—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Mr. Kynoch.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin. To correct Opposition Members, I said that I might give way, but that I wanted to proceed. If the hon. Member for Falkirk, East had listened carefully, he would agree that that was what I said. I was saying—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. We are debating a procedural motion to consider part II of the Bill after part IV. The Bill is in Committee. We finished consideration of part I the other day. It has gone no further than that. The hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside has used a procedural mechanism to justify his opinion that part I has been considered by the Committee. He said that the reason that water management in Scotland had to be reorganised was that there was a reorganisation of local government. That is not yet the case. The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1450</span>
Committee is only considering that, and it might still be thrown out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has been in order during his speech. That is the important point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin. I wish to confine my remarks to the motion. Opposition Members are getting upset at the prospect of discussing in detail a very complex structure to try to find the best way forward for the people of Scotland. They may not consider that cost-effectiveness is the best way of looking at this. It has been quite apparent in other debates on the Bill that they have been more intent on looking after local government employees than consumers and taxpayers. I believe, as do my hon. Friends, that taxpayers have a right to have us ensure that water and sewerage structures are cost-effective and so that we can deliver the best quality water at the lowest possible cost.<br><br>
We have had much time to consult the public about this. The referendum did not enable balanced discussion in Strathclyde. Charles Gordon, the Labour councillor who launched the campaign for the referendum, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Despite all their talk, the Conservatives clearly want to privatise Scotland's water. There is a hidden agenda. Soon we will find French, English and Welsh water companies vying with each other to buy up Scotland's water."</p></blockquote>
With due respect, if that is not a very biased interpretation before we have the opportunity in Committee to discuss the details of the Bill, I have heard nothing yet. We should proceed with this part of the Bill which is important to the people of Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman talks about the Government's consultation in November 1992, but the Government allowed only 10 weeks for consultation on this vital issue. Paragraph 2.4 of the summary of responses to the consultation paper states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Sixty-four per cent. of all respondents, and 67 per cent. of those opposing privatisation, preferred a solution which kept the services in local authority control".</p></blockquote>
That was then, before people woke up fully to the consequences of what the Government were about. On the Government's own restricted timetable that was the response that came forward.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is this an intervention or a speech?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman came in at the last election. If he continues to ignore the views of Scottish councillors, both Conservative and Labour, and the results of the Strathclyde referendum and opinion polls across the country, he will contribute to the undermining of the parliamentary democracy that he talks about. That is very dangerous and he would do well to reflect very seriously on it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will consider his response to the electors of Strathclyde about the £750,000 that the referendum has cost. That money could have gone towards the provision of other services. On the evening of the result of the referendum I understand that on the BBC news a number of people were interviewed in the street in Strathclyde. The bulk of them, I am told, did not understand that the Government were not privatising water in Scotland.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The motion is to defer debate on some clauses until we have had an opportunity to discuss these matters. But the Bill was printed on 9 December 1993 and we have had ample opportunity for discussion. I have discussed them with my constituents and expressed my regret that we are not privatising the water industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend. I agree that we have had more than adequate time to consider the issues. Constituents are free to communicate on any aspect of the Bill and I am sure that members of the Committee have received a vast mail-bag from a cross-section of the people of Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. The hon. Member for Tayside, North has confirmed that he wants to see water and sewerage services privatised. That is germane to the debate. We have been led to believe that privatisation is not on the agenda. Is the hon. Member for Tayside, North saying that that is the sub text, that he wants privatisation and that that is the Government's policy?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not a matter of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin. I hope that we shall discuss those points later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I am sure that no hon. Member would want to mislead the Committee, but the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside quoted the figure of £750,000 for the cost of the referendum. That is not the figure. If he had read the material that he has received from Strathclyde, he would have seen that the cost was much less than that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How much less?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It cost £650,000. I am sure that the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside does not wish to mislead the Committee and create a legend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If my figures are out by £100,000 and the referendum cost £650,000, the people of Strathclyde need to know how that cost can be justified.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It cost £675,000.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend tells me that it cost £675,000. That expenditure was made at the cost of other services in Strathclyde.<br><br>
This is a complex subject. We need to debate how the water authorities are run, how they provide services and the balance between rural and city consumers. We should therefore, do that as quickly as possible. I see no reason for the argument that we have not had adequate time for consideration, given the time scale governing the Bill and the consultation document to which my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North referred. Opposition Members have whipped up much emotion and they have been scaremongering. That is their normal way of opposing measures and they have done it with other aspects of Government policy. We should get down to debating the issues and we should do that as quickly as possible.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1452</span>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been a good debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Two Tories have spoken in a row.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The fact that I am speaking now does not necessarily mean the end of the debate. Few Opposition Members understand the procedures of the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I appreciate that we may not be approaching the end of the debate, but I thought it was usual—I do not question your decision, Mr. Martin—to move from one side of the Committee to the other when choosing speakers. I understand why you have taken a different line on this occasion, but that is the normal procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not give reasons for calling a particular speaker. That is a matter for my judgment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dundee, East was banging away saying that such a motion was unprecedented. Of course, it is not. Anyone who has been a member of a Committee will realise that it is quite common to change the batting order of clauses and schedules. The hon. Gentleman was wrong.<br><br>
We have had about 130 hours of debate in Committee. It is noticeable that we have made a number of amendments to clauses and schedules following our debates. We are here to do that. I should have thought that the hon. Members for East Lothian and for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) would have been thankful for some of the amendments that have been made. Instead, they say that the Committee has been of no use. We should be discussing the issues, listening to the arguments when good points are made and making changes when necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that when Opposition Members have a good point, he is willing to consider it. Of the 71 per cent. of people in Strathclyde who voted, 97 per cent. said no to water quangos and privatisation. Is that not something that should be listened to?</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course it should be listened to.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is ignoring it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have not even had a debate about it. The hon. Member for Paisley, South behaves like—well, I had better not say what he behaves like. [HON. MEMBERS: "Say it."] I should hate to think that this was a china shop.<br><br>
The hon. Members for Hamilton and for Angus, East know that this is not genuinely a debate to change the procedure of the Committee—it is an excuse to have a debate on the referendum. The speech of the hon. Member for Hamilton reminded me to beware of socialists bearing gifts. I shall certainly not accept from him the idea that changing the arrangement of the Bill's clauses and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0804">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1453</span>
schedules will prevent us from debating as soon as possible the issue of water, which is of prime importance to the people of Scotland and to the Committee. The Committee is here to discuss water and sewerage, which come next on the amendment paper, and that is what I shall advise my comrades on the Committee to do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: With great courtesy and skill, the Minister piloted the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 through its Committee stage. It was he who undertook most of the tasks involved, not the right hon. Member for Bridgwater (Mr. King). The Minister and I have served together on Committees for 30 years and I ask him this in all seriousness: does he recollect the so-called Sandford amendment to clauses 28 and 29 of that Bill? On that occasion, Ministers went back to their colleagues to ask whether there would be general Government agreement for certain things to be changed. Will he, bearing in mind the great skill that he exercised then, reflect once more on the request of my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton and at least take this back and consider it? If he does not, I know from my knowledge of political history that it will be greatly misinterpreted in Scotland. It was always accepted in Scotland—until 10 years ago—that at least in Westminster, points of view different from those of the Government of the day were listened to. That is, alas, ceasing to be the case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point very seriously. I appreciate what he said about the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. That is why I told the hon. Member for Dundee, East, that this is by no means a unique procedure. However, the circumstances at that time were different. At that stage of the proceedings, we were still having detailed discussions on management agreements and the Government were not ready to put down their amendments. Altering the arrangement of the clauses and schedules and delaying debate by a day or so enabled us to achieve that. It was achieved by agreement between the Opposition and the Government, and it worked very satisfactorily.<br><br>
The circumstances today are rather different. We are discussing whether we should postpone debate on a major portion of the Bill—the whole principle of part II—so that the Opposition can have a field day and say that they have won a battle over the referendum.<br><br>
I believe firmly that the correct procedure is to continue considering the Bill as it is, and to move on to part II when we have dealt with the motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why does the Minister not want time to reflect on the referendum result?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been thinking about it ever since it was published.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister has been reflecting on the referendum results—and that would be to his credit—I presume that the Government will at some stage be prepared to announce that there will be no change or that they will institute several changes. It would be better for the Government, for Scotland and for this place if the Government would pause to allow themselves to run with a new package that we could consider in a coherent fashion. There would be nothing worse than to go through
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1454</span>
a charade in which the Government put forward all their present proposals and then made changes bit by bit, without enabling us to understand each in the context of the others. That would be bad government and would just annoy people. The Government owe it to us to treat the matter properly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, the correct way is to proceed with consideration of the many amendments. I am glad that the Chairman has selected the clause stand part debate as part of the group. We will be able to have a very wide-ranging debate on the entire issue, to run today and Tuesday. All hon. Members will have a full opportunity to express their views on water in Scotland. I shall listen to the debate, reply to it, and we shall reach a decision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister is trying to be helpful, he could help the Committee further by telling us whether the Government are prepared to consider any change at all as a result of the outcome of the referendum.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No Minister ever comes to a Standing Committee without being prepared to listen to the arguments, and I shall do exactly that. However, I cannot get to that stage if we do not start to deal with the Bill. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] Opposition Members are postponing the issues that we want to discuss.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As we meet here this morning, a Cabinet meeting is in progress. We understand from this morning's radio broadcasts that the Cabinet will be considering the issue of blocking minorities in the European Community and that the Government may well make a compromise proposal. The Cabinet is considering a change of policy. Is not it conceivable that the Cabinet might also be listening to the Secretary of State for Scotland—who is allowed, through our generosity, to attend the Cabinet meeting this morning—explaining that Conservative councillors in Scotland were yesterday asking the Government to change their mind and that today's proposals are completely reasonable, in that a brief delay to allow the Government to examine a complete package for submission to the Committee is not an instance of socialists bearing gifts but an opportunity to get the Government off a nasty hook?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is conceivable, but I do not have a walkie-talkie, so I do not know what they are doing in No. 10</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way, although I should like to get on, otherwise we shall be here till lunchtime considering the motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister, who has a reputation as a reasonable man. Surely he can grasp the fact that 97.2 per cent. is, by any standard, a blocking majority and that it will be a waste of time and of public money to create the structures for which clauses 61, 62 and others provide, when they will obviously not be able to stand the test of time, given the verdict of half of the people of Scotland. Why waste public money and parliamentary time on pursuing legislation when the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0805">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1455</span>
Government could, as my hon. Friend said, get themselves off that hook?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is Opposition Members who are wasting parliamentary time. We could have been discussing water and sewerage in Scotland for two hours now. I said earlier that I accept, of course, the referendum figures and that the ballot paper was perfectly fair in its way. However, I am highly critical of the Labour party for its presentation of the issue in Scotland in the past year or so. Labour Members know well that privatisation is not on the menu. I have said so before. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Hon. Members may have their own views, and why not, but they are not necessarily the Government's view. I have stated clearly in the Chamber at Question Time that privatisation is not on the menu.<br><br>
I watched on television the Scottish Labour party conference in Dundee and heard a splendid speech on water by the hon. Member for Clydesdale (Mr. Hood). However, it was on the wrong subject. He talked about privatisation, which is not our policy. Opposition Members have also discussed disconnections, which is not our policy. Similarly, they have homed in on rising prices. When we debate that, I shall explain how prices have risen under the current water authorities, particularly those controlled by Labour.<br><br>
This morning we were given the Scottish Trades Union Congress and Labour pamphlet saying,
<br><blockquote><p>"The Tories are planning to sell off our water".</p></blockquote>
That is not true and Labour Members know perfectly well that it is not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is true.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may shout that it is true, but it is not true. The Government are entitled to have a policy and to be respected for putting it plainly before—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is true.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Everyone else got a hearing. The Minister is entitled to a hearing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Labour pamphlets have been hammering away about disconnections. I have made perfectly clear that that is not Government policy. We are not changing the Act that covers that matter in Scotland. Trying to talk to Opposition Members is like talking to a brick wall. They just will not understand Government policy. They have not even read the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend control his language? He is being unfair to brick walls.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, it is a red brick wall and we know what happened to the one in Berlin.<br><br>
I am told that the referendum cost £650,000. That money, spent by a Labour-controlled authority that complains bitterly about not having sufficient finance to provide services, could have gone on health, education and other causes much more worthy than what Strathclyde put it to.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1456</span>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall not give way, but even if I do not, the hon. Gentleman will raise a point of order and he has raised more than enough points that were non-points of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I had the opportunity for an intervention, but it would be useful to register as a point of order that the referendum cost 37p per elector in Strathclyde. That seemed to be good value for money.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was not a point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is so depressing that when we do not give way to Opposition Members, they raise points of order that are not real points of order. The hon. Member for Fife, Central knows perfectly well that that was not a point of order. It is time that he learnt how to conduct Committee business in the House of Commons.<br><br>
We want to get on with the debate and so we shall oppose the procedural motion which has been moved not to deal with the issue of water in Scotland, but to provoke discussion on the referendum. We oppose that motion and want to get on with discussing in detail the issues when it will be appropriate to listen to views from both sides of the Committee and decide on the correct way to proceed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to speak briefly to support the proposed change in the order of business. That is all that my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton suggested. The purpose of the motion is to give the Minister and his colleagues time to reflect on the outcome of the referendum. I am astonished that they do not want time to reflect on the outcome of such an amazing result. As the Minister was unwilling to answer direct questions from Opposition Members, we can only assume that the Government do not want time to reflect because they intend to steamroller through the Committee their proposals. In some ways, that is not surprising because it is typical of the arrogance and contempt with which the Government have treated the House and the people of Scotland and of the rest of the United Kingdom on so many issues.<br><br>
I can perhaps understand why the hon. Member for Stroud does not understand the strength and depth of feeling in Scotland on this issue, as we witnessed from his earlier trivial remark about people in Glasgow. In the past couple of days, however, people have contacted me and I have spoken to people in my constituency and at home. I know the strength of feeling. People are incensed about the issue and are annoyed that the Government pay no attention to it. I can forgive the hon. Member for Stroud, but I cannot forgive hon. Members who represent Scottish constituencies. They must understand the strength of feeling, but they ignore it.</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Knapman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his forgiveness. Given his cry for time to reflect, I remind him that the Bill was published on 9 December 1993. Conservative Members have had plenty of time in which to reflect on its detail.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I may have forgiven the hon. Gentleman, but I did not give him absolution, so there is still a long way to go.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1457</span>
We know when the Bill was published. All its terms were known at that time and there have been changes, as the Minister said. What was not known at that time, however, was the overwhelming strength of feeling in Strathclyde against the Government's proposal.<br><br>
In one of his usual, intemperate speeches, the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South queried the fact that a referendum was held in Strathclyde only. Well, Strathclyde covers half of Scotland, and that is significant. The hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside challenged the question that was asked on the ballot paper and the associated publicity. I reject what hon. Members say about that. Half of Scotland is significant. As my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian said, the question on the ballot paper was honest and straightforward. I reject what the hon. Member for Ayr said which was, in effect, that 41,557 of his electors are so stupid that they did not understand the question. That is basically what he was saying—<i>[Interruption.]</i> I reject the idea that a question hangs over the meaning of the referendum because Strathclyde represents just half of Scotland. I reject the criticism about the publicity. Suppose that both criticisms were accepted. Let us challenge the Government: if they do not like that referendum, let them hold their own for all Scotland. Let them issue their own publicity, and set out the issue according to their own arguments. I guarantee that there would be a similar, overwhelming rejection of the Government's proposals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps there is something wrong with the hon. Gentleman's ears. I hope that there is nothing wrong with his eyes. I hope that he will read <i>Hansard</i> and what I actually said. I hope that he will stop putting words into my mouth. I said that some regard should be taken to the referendum. The hon. Gentleman should listen and should contemplate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully and, when the hon. Gentleman spoke, I said—sotto voce—to my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East that at least the hon. Gentleman is occasionally disarmingly honest. The hon. Gentleman then went on, however, to reject what 41,500 of his constituents said and he implied that they did not understand when they completed the ballot papers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether my hon. Friend also recalls—I think that <i>Hansard</i> will have recorded it—that the hon. Member for Ayr said that if, somehow, half a dozen envelopes to half a dozen different people came through the door, he suspected that one member of the family would dishonestly send them all back. He accused his constituents of distorting the ballot by some form of manipulation. That shows how contemptuously he regards his constituents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I recall that. I can confirm that my hon. Friend is absolutely right. The hon. Gentleman did say that they could be falsely returned. The only assumption that can be made from that is that the hon. Gentleman has accused a significant proportion of 41,500 of his own constituents of dishonesty. That is appalling.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the hon. Gentleman's constituents and the people of the west central belt of Scotland frequently have views that are different from
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1458</span>
those of constituents living in Tayside, North. That has been demonstrated many times at general elections and in the referendum on Scotland.<br><br>
I have discussed the Bill, including the water provisions, with my constituents. I have made clear to them my disappointment that the Government's policy is not privatisation. My constituents have given me the clear message that they support what the Government are trying to do, despite my disappointment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that the hon. Gentleman has spoken to 60,000 of his constituents about the water proposals. It would be manifestly ridiculous to assume that. He should not look at the results in my constituency, which regularly returns a Labour Member of Parliament, and rightly so, but those in Eastwood, where only 2,109 people sent in their voting papers in favour of the proposals.<br><br>
The Minister, the hon. Member for Eastwood, who regularly verbally abuses Opposition Members, represents that constituency, but a very small percentage of people turned out to support the Government's proposals.<br><br>
Questions have been asked about the number of people who turned out. The hon. Member for Ayr referred to the Scottish referendum on devolution. He may recall that that referendum, as well as requiring that more than 50 per cent. of those who turned out had to be in favour of the proposal, also required 40 per cent. of the electorate to take part.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was a disgrace.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The 40 per cent. rule was a disgraceful provision, put in by Mr. George Cunningham, who sat in on previous sittings.<br><br>
In the Strathclyde referendum, 71.5 per cent. of people returned ballot papers and 97 per cent. of them voted no, which means that 70 per cent. of the electorate voted no. Some electors may have been on holiday, some may have died since the register was published and some may have been unable to vote, but 70 per cent. still voted no. That is why the Government will ignore the referendum at their peril.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside said that local government reorganisation is under way, that-we know that from the Bill, and that Strathclyde will not be there to carry out water and sewerage functions. The same is happening in relation to the police and fire services for which the Government have set up joint boards with councillors to run them. Why have not they done that for water and sewerage?<br><br>
The police and fire services and the water and sewerage services are similar.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will remember that I made that comment in response to the question, "Why not leave it as it is?" The Government have responded to the change and put forward proposals, but they are not to the hon. Gentleman's liking.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was listening, but I am afraid that he does not understand what I am suggesting.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1459</span>
The difference between the police and fire services and water and sewerage services is that the Government have no long-term intention to privatise the police and fire services, but they intend to privatise the water and sewerage services. That is why my hon. Friends are right. The hon. Member for Tayside, North keeps talking about the plain truth.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He sounds like a Jehovah's witness.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The plain truth is that the proposals are a halfway house towards privatisation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the situation proposed by the Government is the same as the situation that previously existed in Wales? There was a Welsh water authority. The same warm words were spoken, but the Government privatised it. People in Scotland must be filled with trepidation having seen the Government perform this two-card trick before.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. For example, if councillors representing the new authorities in Strathclyde are running the joints boards for fire and police—I do not like joint boards—they will be predominantly Labour councillors. They will ensure the proper and effective running of the joint boards.<br><br>
Joint boards are not a second or third, but a fourth best. However, they are a hell of a lot better than quangos. If the majority on the joint boards for water and sewerage are councillors, they will be a bulwark against privatisation. That is why the Government do not want that. They want placemen and placewomen on quangos who will be appointed by the Secretary of State and will do his bidding. When the time comes for privatisation and to make fat profits for the capitalists, the placemen will say yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. Does he agree that the time to debate that is on the relevant clause on the constitution of the water authorities? Should we not move on to that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall discuss it when we reach those clauses, but we should not be discussing them now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Ayr have not been listening. The reason is that this is a democratic country. I have seen dictatorships such as that in Chile where Pinochet and the military crushed people underfoot and those in eastern Europe where similar events took place and no attention was paid to the views of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are straying wide of the motion on the order of consideration when we start debating Chile.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For reasons that you know, Mr. Martin, I am not able to get to Chile, so I talk about it instead.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Is it in order for the hon. Gentleman to suggest that this democratically elected Government are a dictatorship?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1460</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley did not say that the Government were a dictatorship.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I used the word "suggest".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He did not suggest that. I have told the hon. Gentleman not to discuss dictatorships but to return to the motion on the order of consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting that the mind, such as it is, of the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside is running ahead of my argument. He must have a guilty conscience. When I mention dictatorships of the right and of the left, the hon. Gentleman assumes that I shall argue that this country is becomning a dictatorship.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am assuming that the hon. Member will return to the motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is meant to be a democracy, and that means taking account of the views of the people and listening to the most recent, relevant, overwhelming and powerful views that have been expressed on this issue. The referendum was the biggest ever to consider this subject. The result given by the people of Strathclyde was overwhelming and astounding. You see, Mr.—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Martin.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. The Chairman has regularly forgotten the names of members of the Committee, so I thought that I would let him know how that feels.<br><br>
I am glad that we have been given more than an hour to discuss this crucial issue. The hon. Member for Tayside, North rightly said that improving sewerage systems will involve expenditure. In Ayrshire, we know better than anywhere else that we need improvements.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right to focus on expenditure and the requirements for that in the provisions on water and sewerage. Does he realise that Severn Trent Water pic, a private water company in England, has taken £200 million out of the company in operating profit over the past three years? That money would have gone into investment in the infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. We need investment in water and, particularly, sewerage in Ayrshire. We have had problems with beaches that do not satisfy European requirements. That investment can be provided more efficiently through the public sector. It does not have to provide the huge extra costs for profits in the long term, which is what Conservative Members want. As we have seen with Thames Water and almost every other privatised water company in England, the chief executives and senior management receive huge pay increases and shareholders benefit from huge profits. That means that there is less to invest in the much-need infrastructure such as that required in Strathclyde.</span></p>
