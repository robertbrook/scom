	<time>Thursday 14 April 1994</time>
	<p>	<i>(Morning)</i></p>
	<p>[SIR JAMES KILFEDDER 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Local Government etc. (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. Thirty years ago, in this very room, during a Committee debate on Scottish legislation, the late Tom Fraser would chide, Peggy Herbison would complain and Willie Ross would fulminate against the then Secretary of State Jack Maclay, for introducing Government amendments at a relatively late stage. Their fulmination was usually against a single sheet of paper with a few, for the most part, clear Government amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To be fair, I admit that when the Labour Government came to power in 1964, Michael Noble and Pricilla Tweedsmuir did, in their various styles, exactly the same—but for a small number of amendments—and gained the sympathy of the then Chairmen, Betty Harvie Anderson and Jimmy McGuinness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now have not a sheet or two, but a whole raft of new Government amendments brought before us after 35 sittings of the Committee that have taken more than 100 hours of debate. Yah-boo apart, I feel that this is a disgrace to parliamentary procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not give notice of this matter even to my hon. Friends, because until last night I had not checked the nature of the amendments. I find them not nearly as innocent as suggested. I am told by lawyers that they present extreme difficulties. I will give two examples, the first being in amendment no. 828, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(b) after subsection (1B) insert—
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>(1BA) The rateable value ascribed in the non-domestic rating list maintained under the Local Government Finance Act 1988 to a hereditament in England and Wales such as is mentioned in paragraph 2(1A) of Schedule 6 to that Act shall, for the purposes of subsections (1) and (1A) above, be treated as equal to the rent which, assuming such a letting of the hereditament as is required to be assumed for the purposes of subsection (1B) above, would reasonably be attributable to the non-domestic use of property."</li>
</div> <!-- ul --></p></blockquote>
Your powers of interpretation, Sir James, may be greater than those of distinguished Edinburgh lawyers. It is absurd to be landed with such amendments without having had time to examine them in detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I apologise for interrupting the hon. Gentleman because he is making an important point. I have grasped what he is saying. He mentioned the distinguished Scottish Members of Parliament who were in the House 30 years ago. I arrived in the House almost 30 years ago—in October 1964—and I remember those
	<span class='label label-info column'>1764</span>
people. They became Ministers on my arrival here and, during that Parliament, unfortunately the same Government pactice of tabling amendments at a late stage was used. It matters not which party is in Government. As long as amendments are tabled on the Tuesday before the Rising of the House, they are in order. The hon. Gentleman was right to raise the point because this has happened through my time in Parliament under different Administrations, so his criticism applies to Governments of each political hue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are right, Sir James. It has happened before, but, with respect, never to quite this extent. As my hon. Friend for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) said, we are professional politicians who have a professional duty. Failure to scrutinise amendments is a dereliction of that professional duty—indeed, such conduct would be a professional disgrace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To scrutinise amendments, we need time to look through them. Assuming that the Bill was properly thought out, may I ask why they were not tabled a long time ago?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that what the hon. Gentleman has said will be borne in mind by those responsible for these matters this year, next year and 20 years hence. No doubt the problem will continue. The Criminal Justice Bill of 1993 was largely rewritten in Committee. It is important to remember that, as long as the rules are followed everything is in order, which is the case now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James, I support the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) who is noted for his detailed scrutiny of Bills and his wish to prevent them from going through Parliament without the closest possible investigation. His concern is understandable when we are suddenly presented with 41 pages of Government starred amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have already dealt with this matter and do not wish any other hon. Member to pursue it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will allow it if it is not on the same matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not specifically that, Sir James.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman implies that it is related. Therefore I do not wish to take it. We shall now move to amendment No. 583.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>'but shall not make different provision in relation to different localities;'.</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You may well feel, Sir James, that you are going backwards after the late sitting of the House until 3 am this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow made a valid point about this half-baked Bill. Not only is the existing content half-baked, the Government are simply making more up as they go along, which is bad for decision making generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 73 is vital and our amendments seek to tackle some of its excesses. We are debating the subject of charges when the harsh realities of this crazy measure hit Scottish consumers. As the debate unfolds, it will expose the myth that consumers will be safe in Tory hands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 583 especially attempts to tackle two aspects of the charging system. We want to discover what the Government intend as regards charges, under the scheme to which the water authorities will have to work. We require an answer to the question of whether the banding system, which at present involves water and sewerage charges, will be continued by the new water authorities; at present it reflects in some way the ability to pay. The amendment seeks to elicit the Government's opinions on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment's Nos. 601 and 611 relate to a novel Government idea which would have dramatic consequences for the way in which the charges are imposed as well as for consumers. Subsection (3) suggests that a scheme may
	<br><blockquote><p>"make different provision for different cases, or classes of case"</p></blockquote>
and
	<br><blockquote><p>"different circumstances or localities".</p></blockquote>
At present, domestic consumers in one of the regional authority areas, subject to slight distortions of the banding system, pay approximately the same. Are the Government suggesting that remote quangos will be able to impose differential water and sewerage charges in different parts of Scotland? If that happened it would be a major breach of the present system. It would raise the spectre of giving to those unelected quangos enormous powers to change the charging map of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause also provides for the new water authorities to prepare and publish the charges scheme, which they will
	<span class='label label-info column'>1766</span>
have to submit for approval to the customers council. If there is a failure to agree, the scheme will go to the Secretary of State. Everything seems to end up with the Secretary of State, but that should come as no surprise. After three months elapse, the charges scheme can be implemented. That process is tokenism. There will be no effective control of the water authorities' charges by the customers council. Trust will have to be invested in the Secretary of State and the three water quangos. We find that totally unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current banding system reflects ability to pay. When we move to the three water super-quangos, will that system be dispensed with? Will the Government confirm how far they have gone in working out the charges? If they tell us that they have no idea of their intentions, that will be a major dereliction of duty by the Conservative party. Consumers want to know this morning what they will pay after this crazy system is introduced. It is clear from the clause that the Government will give the water quangos enormous powers to tear up existing agreements and, possibly, chart out any system that they want as long as it is nodded through by the Secretary of State, who is increasingly out of touch with Scottish consumers and Scottish political life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will tell us whether the banding and ability-to-pay system will be transferred to the new water quangos or whether it will be a free-for-all in which the bottom line of their accounts will dictate the level of charges, so that domestic consumers are exploited. That is a vital issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concept of different localities raises a new idea in water and sewerage charging. The Government might mean that there may be different categories for industrial groupings and that different services require different charges. Such a view could be argued. However, the clause raises the possibility that different parts of Scotland will have different charges imposed on them. That throws up the key issue or urban and rural areas. In a closely-knit urban environment costs could be lower. That is self-evident. However, what would happen in the Highlands and the Borders?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And in Ayrshire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And in Ayrshire, as my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) is always ready to remind me. There will be problems in such areas. The water quangos will be able to say to consumers in my hon. Friend's constituency that they are a bit geographically remote and, therefore, a drain on funds. The authorities may decide to charge a bit more because of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposals on water have smashed the collective morality that Scotland wants. The clause is a step-by-step process to smashing the standard assessment that has been applied on a banding system. The Scots have accepted that through time. I fear that consumers all over the country will be horrified at the prospect of the powers being given to the water quangos. That will add insult to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0979">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1767</span>
the injury that they have suffered because of this water nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must say what charging for localities really means. Serious consequences could flow. Charges for consumers could rocket under the new system and all there is to save us is a Tory Secretary of State who is hell bent on taking water into the marketplace at the earliest opportunity and unconcerned about the dramatic consequences that could unfold for domestic consumers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scotland has many poor households which cannot afford to pay more for water. The Government's social security legislation took away the full rebated system for water and sewerage, with particular effect on the water charge, and replaced it with a notional element. They have already punished the poor. Are we to believe that the clause is not another nail in the coffin of poor households in Scotland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is morally objectionable for the Government to present half-baked, poorly justified proposals which expose poor households to much greater charges. The incidence of metering will be yet another hardship. The Minister must say whether poorer households are being exposed to a halfway house marketplace in which the quangos will do want they want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even more disturbing is the fact that events will take place behind closed doors. It is bad enough that consumers will be at the mercy of three water quangos, but the quangos will devise water charges that will go through the tokenism of the customers council and end up with the Secretary of State for Scotland. Labour Members have no faith in the right hon. Gentleman's ability to deliver fair charges to consumers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is vital because it not only probes but is intended to discover the Government's thinking beyond the clause which, if it is anything like the 72 clauses that the Committee has examined, has been thought up on the hoof and in haste.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is sad that the Government have tucked away major changes to the charging system. The Minister should not equivocate, as has happened with previous clauses, or give nonsensical justifications which describe issues but do not explain them to the Committee or to Scottish consumers. If the Government do not withdraw much of the clause, consumers will have no option but to believe that they will be put at the mercy of the water quangos, charges will increase, and the budgets of the poorest households could be devastated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not like to think that even this Government want to introduce to Scotland the water poverty of England and Wales. It may be good enough for Tories in England and Wales to foist water poverty on unsuspecting consumers, but we will not have that in Scotland. It could be avoided by the Minister addressing the points that I have made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is crazy and should be withdrawn. That would assure Scottish consumers that we have had enough of this nonsense and that current safeguards for water
	<span class='label label-info column'>1768</span>
distribution in the regional authorities will be transferred immediately to the super-quangos. They must be brought to heel through legislation because we do not trust the Secretary of State and his hon. Friends to build in the safeguards that Opposition Members want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief and counteract the comments of the hon. Member for Fife, Central. Once again, his speech was peppered with words such as "crazy" and "nonsensical". An analysis of the hon. Gentleman's contributions would show that those words are used every time he gets to his feet. Everything that he said contained his characteristic scaremongering. What the hon. Gentleman called his factual statements about the banding system were, in fact, matters of opinion. I reject the hon. Gentleman's idea that ability to pay is reflected in a banding system or in the old rating system. It is not. Many people live in houses that do not reflect their income even though the capital value of the houses may be quite high. Those people face difficult times, with high maintenance costs and high rates. They struggle to stay in houses in which they may have lived all their lives. Why should elderly people be forced out of their houses because of demands made by the rates or other forms of taxation, such as payments for water?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is courteous in giving way, but I do not think that he understands what clause 73 is about. He does not understand that the banding system which, by definition, is linked to property, is thereby linked, albeit imperfectly, to ability to pay. Does the hon. Gentleman want to move from that system to a new water poll tax that will be introduced by the new super-quango? That is what is on offer in clause 73. There must be no equivocation. The present system is not ultra fair, but it is reasonably fair. It is to be replaced by a super water poll tax, imposed by the faceless men appointed by the Secretary of State, who are accountable to no one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give the hon. Gentleman a direct response. It is not a matter of either/or. Options can and should be kept open. I shall describe three varying options for the future methods of payment for water. It could be done by means of the banding system, or by volume of usage—[Hon. Members: "Oh".] I shall comment on that in a moment. The third option is a fixed charge per property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A poll tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The poll tax was a charge per head within a household. If four or five people live in a household, the total payment is four or five times the standard rate. A fixed charge would be simply a fixed charge per property. It would recognise the size of the property, or the number of occupants. The hon. Gentleman, by adding a fourth option, has helped me to demonstrate that there are options that should be kept open in this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am already on a meter, and see nothing wrong with their use. Does my hon. Friend agree that it would be unfair for the person who lives alone in a property that has a different banding value to pay more than the four or five heavy water users next door?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0980">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1769</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. The Bill offers options for the future, and I urge my hon. Friend the Minister not to accept the restrictive amendment that the Opposition are trying to impose on him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give the Opposition something to think about on metering. Every Opposition Member has joined a campaign to remove standing charges on electricity, gas and telephones because the Opposition believe that people should not pay lump sums for basic services. If water charges are made in the way in which the Opposition suggest, a fixed, lump sum will be charged. It would be more logical for the Opposition to propose that water should be provided and metered in the same way as electricity, gas and telephones, but without the standing charge that they believe to be unfair to those who use the services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon McMaster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is this for Scottish Power?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has already called me stupid; he now refers to Scottish Power as stupid. I would not be so discourteous as to call the hon. Gentleman stupid. But his sedentary comments suggest that he should examine his own qualities before uttering inane remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I never expected to hear a serious speech quite like that made by the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie). It raises basic issues. The hon. Gentleman mentioned volume of usage, but a hygiene problem arises. Water is different from any other service. If people have to think every time they flush the toilet, hygiene problems could arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central used the striking phrase, "water poverty". That is not an exaggeration. I do not wish to be indelicate, but anyone who talked to my late lamented colleague, Bob Cryer, or to my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Madden) about what has happened in Bradford, or to my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Mrs. Jackson) about Sheffield, would realise that the position is deeply unsatisfactory. Nobody wishes such a position to exist in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the ability to pay, I have one concise question, which worries the Scottish Consumer Council. Clause 64(2) requires the Secretary of State and the new authorities to have regard to the interests of those who,

need a supply of water that is greater than average. Why is such a requirement necessary unless the Government envisage more widespread metering? It has been argued that a fault in the legislation for England and Wales is that it includes no such requirement. But in England and Wales, metering, and the possibility of disconnection—which we shall discuss later—have caused problems for the group of consumers that I described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government argue that disconnection or withdrawal of water will not be legal. Therefore, we
	<span class='label label-info column'>1770</span>
assume that the Government envisage ability to pay and metering becoming more widespread. I should like that question answered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not planned to speak, but after the speech of the hon. Member for Linlithgow, I must just say that, of course, no one wants hygiene problems in Scotland. Realistically, in the absence of disconnections, we must recognise that the question will be how one pays, who pays and what the payment is for. In the interests of sense and equity people should be educated about the real value of water, which is a precious resource and should not be squandered. If people continue to think that they can just turn on the tap, leave the water running and it will make no difference to anyone, they are not living in the real world.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said in an earlier intervention, I am already on meters and I see nothing wrong with them. I understand the problems of people meeting payments because we all have constituents who are unable to manage their finances and resources. However that should not prevent us from introducing a system that will make the vast majority of people recognise the importance of water whose worth should be acknowledged and paid for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to contribute to the debate on the basis of amendment No. 611, which stands in my name. I subscribe entirely to the way in which the hon. Member for Fife, Central moved the lead amendment in the group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two issues of stragegic importance to people in Scotland, particularly in rural areas, are involved. They are, first, how charges will impact on low-income households and, secondly, the provision that will relate to the water supply in rural locations and their potential difference from those that have applied in the past. The Minister should spell out what the Government foresee happening on both issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I try to take an interest in social security matters and, like all other members of the Committee, I do a fair amount of casework relating to social security provisions. When the poll tax and other changes to local government finance were introduced, I was worried that insufficient provision was made in the social security system to account for them. The hon. Member for Fife, Central referred to changes, such as the change from supplementary benefit pre-1988, that were made to take account of the introduction of the community charge. They were inadequate and were eroded by time and inflation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are not careful, we could end up with water proverty. I do not think that it is an exaggeration to make such a claim. It may not affect a significant percentage of the population, but the effects on those whom it will affect are potentially dramatic. Do the Government intend to monitor not just the amount of water that people use, but the impact on people over the next few months and years as the new system is introduced? Will the Minister assure the Committee that if there is any evidence from any source that the system of charges introduced by the Bill affects low-income families, he will, as a matter of urgency, hold
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0981">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1771</span>
discussions with his colleagues in the Department of Social Security to try to ensure that some provision is made at the time of the annual uprating? There is an opportunity every year to uprate social security benefits. The Committee should be assured that in no circumstances will the problems of public health and hygiene, which were raised, quite appropriately, by the hon. Member for Linlithgow, come to pass. I agree that we must not scaremonger and I do not want to, but I think that the Committee should consider that important issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman suggests that he does not want different provisions for a range of localities. How does he square that stance with his support for other amendments? The hon. Gentleman was in favour of establishing 12 local water authorities. That course of action would have created an even greater range of charges in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a slight misinterpretation of the idea that I was advancing by way of those amendments. The question was more one of enabling greater local knowledge to be brought to bear on specific circumstances, than of establishing different patterns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about cost?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was not the main purpose of the amendment that I moved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May we nail the question of scaremongering? That is not what is happening. The hard evidence is that elderly people and, dare I say—one is on delicate ground—certain immigrant communities, because of sparse resources, leave plugs unpulled when they should have been pulled. It is not scaremongering to say that. It is a human reaction among those who are careful about watching the pennies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right. I do not want to underestimate the problem. I know, because I was concerned about it when the system was changed, that the old supplementary benefits system included a system of special needs payments, which took account of conditions such as incontinence, and catered for such items as extra laundry charges arising from an illness. The new system of income support does not. It was simplified, and we understand the reasons for that. However, one of the prices that was paid for the simplification was that flat-rate payments were established. People who now receive laundry bills for sheets and clothing because they suffer from incontinence are no longer catered for as well as they were. That is a worry. It would be intolerable for people not to have clean sheets despite being incontinent, or to have to think twice about flushing the toilet because it would increase water charges. I do not think that any Committee members would want that to happen. The Government argue that that is not a worry and that we are raising these points needlessly. I do not agree. The question will have to be tackled. If the Minister gives a cast iron assurance that he will monitor carefully what happens after the introduction of the charges, I may be prepared to accept it, but the Committee cannot set its concerns aside lightly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1772</span>
I have encountered in my constituency work another relevant problem, one which, although it is not confined to the Borders, is particularly acute there, because recently, for various reasons, some of which relate to the physical environment of south-east Scotland, there have been relatively steep increases in water charges. Difficulties are being encountered in the provision of stretches of pipes and sewerage across long distances. Another factor is the background of the raising of standards by central Government and the European Commission, against which no one would argue. The combination of those factors has led to an increase in charges. I am very concerned at the impact of such an increase, especially in south-east Scotland. Can the Minister give any words of comfort to people in areas such as the Borders who have suffered increases in charges in the past and will no doubt suffer them in the future?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has a job on his hands to reassure consumers in rural areas that they will not suffer discrimination under the Bill. I understand that some prima facie protections are provided in clause 73, but they do not go nearly far enough. The Minister's experience of representing a rural area is greater than mine, and I do not believe that he, in all conscience, would set his name to a system that would be to the long-term financial detriment of people in rural areas of Scotland. However, having examined the Bill and such statements as the Government have made, I must tell him that there is still concern about how rural Scotland will fare in the context of these provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will take this opportunity to dispel those fears, so that we can tell water industry consumers in Scotland that we are satisfied that their rights will be protected and that these provisions will not prejudice, them financially.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate speaks volumes about the depressing state to which Scotland has been reduced over the past 15 years.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman again says that it is a scarce resource. Anyone who was in Scotland last weekend would hardly have considered water to be a scarce resource.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is plenty of water in Scotland. The Scottish water industry and local authorities have demonstrated over many years their ability to provide high-quality, wholesome water in abundance, to residences and industries.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0982">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

readily available in rural constituencies in Scotland, he is talking nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not take lectures about rural constituencies from the hon. Member for Tayside, North. I represent a rural constituency myself, and am well aware of the way in which water is supplied and sewage and septic tanks dealt with. It is nonsense to talk about water as a scarce resource in Scotland, which must be rationed by price.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also dangerous nonsense to suggest, as the hon. Members for Tayside, North and for Ayr have done, that people deliberately waste vast quantities of water at home. Is the hon. Member for Tayside, North seriously telling us that people are having several baths every day and running water just for the hell of it? Is he saying that they deliberately leave taps running? That is plainly absurd.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalywell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will have noted that clause 97, which we shall debate later, provides that the costs of emptying septic tanks will have to be met.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and we shall come to that debate in due course. My hon. Friend is right. That point will have special impact in rural parts of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members have implied that profligate householders in urban and rural areas in Scotland are deliberately wasting large quantities of water simply because they only have to pay for it through their council tax. That is demonstrably nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, because I have had enough of the hon. Gentleman. I look forward to hearing from a Minister on this issue. I hope that we shall have some sense from the Minister, which has been singularly lacking from Government Back Benchers.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I echo my hon. Friend's hope that the Minister will give us some information on the matter. In previous discussions, it would also have been useful to have more information from Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning, I received a letter from the Conservative group on Tayside regional council, in response to a letter that I sent to that dying breed of person, Conservative regional councillors in Scotland. Mr. Alan Powrie, the secretary of the Tayside region Conservative group said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For your information I quote from an … amendment which we proposed at the Water Services Committee yesterday and which inter alia said "The Secretary of State be urged to consider that the appointments to the new Water Authorities should be elected accountable Councillors who would be nominated by their Constituent Councils.'"</p></blockquote>
It is possible, given that Conservative Members failed to represent the views of Conservatives in their constituencies, that they are doing the same today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1774</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend should cherish that letter not only because of its content but because, the way things are going, it may be the last letter ever to come from a Conservative regional group in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the risk of a tax being imposed on the consumption of water in domestic premises in Scotland. Conservative Members seem to be profoundly concerned about the prospect of an equality or a fair distribution of charges, on a similar basis to the council tax. They seem worried that people in small, low-value houses, perhaps in urban areas, may not pay enough towards the cost of their water.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, I know of no evidence of such people using vast quantities of water for no good reason. The big water consumers will probably be the kind of people who fill swimming pools or irrigate large gardens. They tend not to be in the low council tax bands but in the high council tax bands. If water charges were assessed on the basis of council tax bands, that would reflect in general a reasonably fair distribution of the costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central spoke of the alarming prospect of water poverty. He is right. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow, I am profoundly alarmed by the evidence from Bradford, Sheffield and the Isle of Wight—which I suspect is one of the worst cases—of the most shocking examples of water poverty; of people having to recycle their bath water because of water metering and because they cannot afford the whole costs of the new charges. That is a tax on hygiene. It would be a serious imposition on people who have medical conditions that require a high consumption of water. There must be safeguards for such people. I earnestly hope and believe that we shall hear some sense from the Minister on this point because it has been sadly lacking from Conservative Back Benchers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I invite the Minister to consider one other detail. Like the hon. Member for Tayside, North, I have personal experience of a metered water supply, which applies in some types of rural properties. I suggest that not only would metered water supplies give rise to high charges when there is usually high consumption, but that problems can arise when there are leaks in water pipes or burst water pipes. A burst pipe is not the same as a burst tank in the loft, about which one knows immediately. It may be underground and weeks or months can pass before one realises that there is leak. One may not find out until the next meter reading. How often do hon. Members hear of problems in their constituencies during frosty weather, when distraught householders worry about the consequences of burst water tanks, for example? Would it not add insult to injury if, some months later, those householders were to receive a bill for the water that the meter showed had been consumed as a result of such a leak? That is yet another alarming example of the unfairness that can arise as a result of metered water supplies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the amendment to the Committee. There must be safeguards, and there must be fairness in the way in which charges are made for water.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central would ensure that all domestic charges would be levied on the same basis as the distribution of the council tax burden on properties. That would guarantee some degree of fairness in the charging structure. Without such a safeguard, there is the alarming prospect of discriminatory charging or of a move to metering.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing in the Bill that implies compulsory metering for domestic supplies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Tayside, North, who has left the Room temporarily, said in his brief intervention that we had to be realistic about the charges schemes to be introduced by the new water boards. Conservative Members are rarely realistic, but sometimes they can be disarmingly honest. In an earlier debate, the hon. Gentleman said that elected councillors could not be on the new water boards because they could not be trusted to bring in charges schemes sufficient to fund the investment required in future years. The hon. Gentleman was quite honest. He said that the boards had to be made up of appointees because the charges introduced would have to be very much higher than the charges currently levied on domestic water consumers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Conservative party outside Parliament understand that. That is why my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton brought to the Committee's attention the letter from the Conservative group on Tyneside regional council. That group recognises the importance of having elected people on the new water boards so that the charges schemes can be limited. However, in reality, the boards will be packed with appointees. Charges will be introduced to pay for the investment required over the next few years in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can be sure about one thing—everyone in Scotland will have to pay considerably more than at present for the supply of water. The debate is about how people will be expected to pay the significantly increased charges. A number of suggestions have been made. Opposition Members have suggested that we should try to ensure that the higher water charges are distributed fairly among the population and that they are related in some way to people's ability to pay. That is why we want the charges to be implemented through the council tax banding system, which to some extent reflects the ability to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the hon. Member for Ayr would have none of that. He is not prepared to allow the new water boards to introduce a scheme that tries to distribute the burden
	<span class='label label-info column'>1776</span>
according to people's ability to pay. He favours a fixed charge on every house. That would mean, for example, that my mother, who lives in a one-bedroom flat in a sheltered housing complex in Dundee, would pay the same as a person who lives in a multi-bedroomed mansion on the Perth Road in Broughty Ferry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman would not give way to me. I do not see why I should give way to him. He will just have to listen and take it. If he does not like it, too bad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must guarantee that there is no possibility of a new water board introducing a system of fixed charges on every house in its area, irrespective of the size and location of the houses. We want to know that that is ruled out in statute and that the boards will not be able to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Ayr and for Tayside, North suggested that a charges scheme that might be introduced could be a metered system of water supply. Everyone knows that if water metering is brought in, the poor will have to disconnect themselves if they cannot afford to pay; they will have to stop flushing the toilet and wash less frequently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was horrified by an expression used by the hon. Member for Tayside, North. He said that people had to be educated about the real value of water. People with disabilities do not have to be educated about that; they know the real value of water because they use it far more than others. They do not need lectures from the likes of the hon. Gentleman. Parents with young children, the elderly or my mother, who has to be close to a toilet at all times, do not want to be told that every time they use facilities it will cost them. That is the point that Labour Members want to stress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should not rant on about bringing in a metering system. I made it clear that the Bill provides for that only if a consumer voluntarily asks for a meter. It would not matter if a small household used buckets and buckets of water because it would not have to be metered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it was up to the Minister, I would accept that guarantee. If he was in charge of the water boards, and in charge of deciding how the charges schemes would be implemented and how people in every corner of Scotland would pay for water, I would be prepared to accept what he said. However, he is not. He is setting up a statutory scheme which will allow water boards to make the decisions. The boards will be able to introduce charges schemes that the Minister will not control, which is why we cannot accept his guarantee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Tayside, North said that water was scarce in Scotland. Does he live in the real world? Scottish Enterprise Tayside is thinking about funding a scheme to export Scottish water because it has too much. It thinks that it can sell water in England and Wales where there is a shortage. There is no question of water being scarce in Scotland in the future. The question is whether water will be paid for by fair or unfair means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0984">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1777</span>
The Minister is setting up a statutory system of unelected water boards that will be appointed to make tough decisions about increasing water charges in Scotland. The boards will decide which charges schemes they want implemented, but will not even have the responsibility of collecting the charges. That will be passed to the local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local authorities will have to deal with people's hatred when the charges schemes are imposed. The boards are unnaccountable, not responsible, unelected and unwanted. The Minister should understand that while he is an honourable man, htere are others in the Government who are not as honourable. I accept his word, but will not accept the word of other Conservative Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment deals with the basis of water charges schemes and introduces the principle of financial fairness into such schemes. I support it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious that there could be forms of water rationing based on a lack of ability to pay. I do not want that in Scotland, nor for such a philosophy to be imposed, for obvious health reasons, quite apart from the effect on families and their finances. Metering and self-disconnection is unacceptable if used as a means of water rationing. Inability to pay should not lead to any form of disconnection or enforced reduction in water usage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would introduce financial fairness based on ability to pay. As the hon. Member for Tayside, North said, water is a precious resource, but so is human health. There is no shortage of water in Scotland. I want a clean, wholesome water supply readily available to every individual and family in Scotland with no form of rationing and no disconnections. I do not want the horrors of disconnections that there were in England introduced in any shape or form to Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member representing an English constituency, I want to put the record straight about disconnections in England and Wales. As I recall it, there were 18,000 disconnections out of a total of 20 million customers. Before anyone is disconnected, the water and regulator use a process. People are disconnected if they can but will not pay. Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that those who deliberately do not pay their water bills and, therefore, put a charge on the consumers who do pay, should be allowed to go scot free?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are other means of collecting debts, which should always be used. There should never be disconnections. The hon. Gentleman talks blithely about 18,000 disconnections, but I find even one disconnection unacceptable. In addition, I do not want to see the form of self-disconnection that has appeared in England whereby families deliberately stop using water. We do not want that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have forgotten some old Victorian lessons. I do not want to see repeated in Scotland what
	<span class='label label-info column'>1778</span>
happened in Southampton where a lady with seven children, one aged three who suffers from a heart condition, and a family of five, the mother of which suffers from a medical condition requiring a constant supply of water, have water provided to them by their neighbours using a hosepipe. In Scotland, we have the raw material and a well-established supply system. I do not want debt enforced or lack of supply for good health reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman creates more fear among those interested in the subject, how many more times must I say that the disconnection of domestic supplies will not be possible in Scotland? I shall have more to say on that later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will put that assurance in the Bill, so that the present position is maintained. However, in England there have been forms of self-disconnection that are unfair and unacceptable. Scotland has plenty of the raw material and, as a society, we should ensure that water is supplied to all who need it and that they do not need to skimp and save it. I want the system to be efficient, but, for health reasons, I do not want disconnections, or the type of self-disconnection that has taken place in England, to occur in Scotland. Every family and individual has the right to supply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his response to my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson), the hon.

Gentleman that system to be sustained?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman had read my amendments, he would have seen that I deliberately ruled out poinding or warrant sales in pursuit of water debts. I hope that he will support the amendment if he shares my view that warrant sales are an obscenity. However, there are other methods of collecting debts. Our prime concern should be to ensure that low-income families, whose members have been unemployed for far too long and who live on the fringes of poverty, do not lose access to water supplies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I seek assurances that the lessons taught us by our Victorian ancestors have not been forgotten. Victorians introduced and gifted our society with a far-sighted approach to public and individual health and to water provision. Any charges schemes must take ability to pay into account. Our concern is for low-income families and for fairness in charging. It is up to the Government to prove that the new system will deliver such fairness. Whether the Minister will do that remains to be seen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important debate and two others will follow on the clause. Amendment No. 583 would perpetuate in charges schemes the council tax banding template. It would not be right to constrain the new authorities in that way, but perhaps they will decide to follow that template, especially in the early years. We shall require them to follow it in the event of collection by a local council under a clause 76 order, which we shall discuss later. Water authorities must be free to examine their

	<span class='label label-info column'>1779</span>
approaches to charging from scratch and propose their own ideas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A theme of the Opposition's argument is that water is inexpensive and plentiful. Water in Scotland is plentiful. However, we do not always have the right storage capacity. It takes only two or three weeks of drought for water retrictions to be put in place. Therefore, we cannot claim that the supply of water in Scotland is always unlimited. It has to be husbanded in times of drought. Anyone who was in Scotland last weekend would believe that we had enough water to keep us going.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was not much fun lambing last Friday and Saturday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition also gave the impression that, under local authority control, water has recently been an inexpensive commodity. They imply that water is a low-cost commodity. But over the past four years, the cost of water for a household has risen on average by 106 per cent. That figure is high. Those who have the statistics can examine each region and see how the cost of water has increased substantially from 1988ߝ89 to 1993ߝ94. No one should be under the impression that the cost of water is not increasing dramatically under local authority control. That also applies to sewerage, which many members of the Committee overlook. Nevertheless it is important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) leaps up and would say that the cost of water is lowest in Falkirk. Well done to that authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is right. The cost of water in Scotland is increasing. However, would he compare the average cost to a household of the water and sewerage supply in Scotland with that under the privatised system in England and Wales? The cost in England and Wales is almost twice that in Scotland. Water is cheaper under local authority control in Scotland than it is under the privatised system in England and Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the hon. Gentleman is again exaggerating. The percentage increase has been less in England and Wales than in Scotland. However, I acknowledge that the average bill in 1993ߝ94 was £67 in Scotland and £88 in England. But the systems start from different bases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the context of my original point, how many complaints have been received about the cost of water in Scotland? People in Scotland are satisified with the charges and are willing to pay more. But in England and Wales, people are upset by the cost of water under privatisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could not possibly tell how many people complained to each authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: None.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1780</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Probably not to the hon. Gentleman's water authority because the cost there is the lowest in Scotland. However, people in areas where the cost of water is especially high may have complained. The cost is very high in the islands. We must not give the impression that water is inexpensive and that the price is not increasing rapidly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The comments of the hon. Member for Falkirk, East are nonsensical. I receive complaints about the council tax, which absorbs the water charge. The cost of water is hidden. When the bills come in, people do not see it as a separate charge. It is a one-off, ail-off charge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The majority of people tend to look at the bottom line even if water is billed as a separate charge. Sewerage is included in the council charge, so it is a hidden charge. It is right to make clear to the public what the costs for water and sewerage are when they pay their council tax bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members complained about there being no adequate control of charging. We have discussed at length not only the responsibilities of the water authorities but those of the customers council and the area committees, all of which will rightly have a say in the amount and make-up of the charges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 601 and 611 would remove the discretion for charge schemes to make different provision for different localities. There is a considerable difference in charges in the different localities, with a differential of almost 3.5 between Central region and the Western Isles. The Government intend to move towards uniform pricing as soon as practicable; this may take two or three years. I assure hon. Members, especially the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, that rural areas will gain from that, because almost all rural water authorities have higher charges than authorities in the industrial areas of the centre. But we must move that together slowly and carefully because to do it in one fell swoop would mean a big increase for the industrial areas of central Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Kynoch 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I represent a rural constituency so I welcome the Government's intention to move to a uniform charge. Is my hon. Friend aware that there is anxiety in rural areas still about the possible introduction, by either direct or indirect means, of infrastructure charges. Will he comment on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There may be comment but there is not intent. I tabled an amendment specifically to draw to the attention of the water authorities the importance of giving special consideration to rural areas not only in charging but in infrastructure, as well as—importantly—taking responsibility for looking after rural areas as much as the rest of Scotland. Everyone is entitled to a supply of good, clean water and proper sewerage connection, or septic tank arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On charging policies, what guarantees can the Minister give that the new Scottish water boards will not introduce the same policy as applies in England whereby capital expenditure is paid for from revenue,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0986">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1781</span>
which means double charges in England and massively increased costs to consumers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We discussed that in some detail earlier when we debated the financing of the water authorities. Part of capital expenditure will, as now, come from charges, part from revenue, and part from the alternative schemes for investment by the water authorities. I cannot give exact guarantees about how a water authority will decide to fix its charges relative to its capital investment and revenue. It will be in the water authority's own interest to keep its charges to consumers as low as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fact that the Minister cannot give a guarantee is precisely the trouble. He makes a valued judgment about what he thinks the new authorities may or may not do and see in their own interests. The new authorities' judgment may be totally different. The Minister said at the beginning of his speech:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It would not be right to constrain the new authorities."</p></blockquote>
We are being given—forgive me saying so—a fraudulent prospectus. The Minister may make his remarks in good faith, but he cannot deliver, on the basis of what he said he cannot deliver.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that we should not constrain the authorities in their pricing, as the hon. Gentleman implied. I said that we should not constrain them in deciding the best method of coming to a conclusion on the system of pricing, which is very different. I want to ensure that the three new water authorities have the opportunity to decide in their own time which system of pricing they want and how they want to charge. That will have to be discussed with the customers council and, of course, the Secretary of State will take a great interest in the matter as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Over what period do that Government have in mind to move toward a uniform pricing structure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like that to happen as soon as is practical. Uniform pricing would obviously help the hon. Gentleman's constituency considerably. I do not envisage a national uniform price; there will be uniform pricing within each new water authority so that people in each of the three areas will pay as near as possible the same. We should all welcome that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Three years, four years, five years, or 10 years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to think in terms of about three years, certainly less than five.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can I seek clarification from the Minister about the underlying principle? I understand that he is keen to have uniform pricing for water and sewerage services across the whole area of each of the boards, not between the boards. What
	<span class='label label-info column'>1782</span>
is the difference between water services and police services? The Minister has been at great pains to explain that there will be different charges in different areas across the same area of a police authority. The urban areas will effectively be subsidising the rural areas. Does the Minister accept that it is not fair if that is applied only to water services and not to police services?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We covered that issue in great depth when we discussed the police and fire services. The capital sums with which the police services deal is different from those with which the water authorities will deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to reply to some individual points that were raised. I have dealt with the point of the hon. Member for Fife, Central about uniform pricing and with his assumption that water pricing would go through the roof and that everyone would pay enormous sums, which is not true. I say again that metering for domestic supply is entirely voluntary and it is up to individuals to decide whether to have meters. Like the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson), I have a meter and I rather wish that I did not. I have run into similar problems of an underground burst about which I did not know about for six months and which has been very expensive. Water authorities will frequently come to some arrangement to help householders with a genuine underground burst. I emphasise again and again that having a meter is voluntary for a householder. There is no reason for forcing him to have one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not all the talk about meters a waste of time and money? All the 1.7 million electors in Strathclyde have been offered the choice of a meter but only one has taken up the option.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is 100 per cent. more than I thought. 	<i>[Laughter.]</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Lothian raised another point in his rather exaggerating way. People with a swimming pool are asked by the water and local authorities to have a meter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<i>[Interruption]</i> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman does not have a swimming pool—perhaps he swims in the Tweed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A nice clean river. The Minister says that people with a swimming pool can be asked to have a meter. I do not think that there is any requirement. There is nothing to stop people filling ponds and swimming pools or irrigating large gardens from their domestic supplies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My information is that the majority of people who have swimming pools are asked to be non-dometic consumers and to have a meter. That is perfectly reasonable, because swimming pools have a vast quantity of water.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) exaggerated the costs involved, and misunderstood the issue of domestic supplies and meters. My hon. Friend the Member for Ayr, however, was right about metering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Linlithgow referred to clause 64. That has been drafted specifically to ensure that people
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0987">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1783</span>
who need large amounts of water to be supplied—for a dialysis machine, for example—must be taken care of by the water authority. If they have a burst pipe, it must be instantly repaired so that water is available for those who need it for medical reasons. Unless they wish to have a meter, they will pay the same as people in other households. There is no question of people who need water for medical reasons having to pay more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not doubt the Minister's good faith in this matter. I am sure that he means what he says. However, by what mechanism will someone on a dialysis machine be protected? It is one thing for the Minister to say this in Committee, but what guarantee will such people have in statute or in law?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They have it in law in clause 64, which provides that an authority must take a special interest in those who require water for special purposes. If the authority did not fulfil its duty, I should expect the customers council or the area committee to leap in and take action forthwith. If they do not do so, the relevant Member of Parliament should be contacted, who should get on to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think for a moment that anyone who needs water for medical reasons will be denied it. If they are, that would be a perfect disgrace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister tells us that the authority must leap in and take action. There is no requirement in clause 64, which I have in front of me, for it to do anything of the kind. If the Minister believes differently, he will doubtless tell me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said before that clause 64 places a duty on the Secretary of State to ensure that such action is carried out by the authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister for Tayside, North put forward an interesting view on metering. As he knows, non-domestic ratepayers make a voluntary decision in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire raised an interesting and important point, that I had already considered, about those on social security benefits or income support. I give him an assurance that I shall monitor any developments in this area. However, I am assured that the income support payment contains an element for water and sewerage, which is looked at year by year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask my hon. Friends to resist the Opposition amendment to the clause and to oppose it if it is pressed to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall press the amendments to a vote. None of the matters raised by the amendments have been dealt with. No Opposition Member questions the integrity and honesty of the Under-Secretary, but it is clear that clause 73 opens up a Pandora's box of new and potentially punitive charges for Scots consumers. The Government can say what they want to in Committee, but the Bill gives the new water authorities every opportunity to do as they
	<span class='label label-info column'>1784</span>
wish. The only constraint is that the Secretary of State will have to approve the water charges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has also been confirmed that Scotland will move to a uniform system of charging. That may be good news for some rural areas, but what will happen in urban areas? The uniform charges will apply, not throughout Scotland, but within each water quango. That is a recipe for chaos. It will cause crisis in many households. No answers have been give to the question of whether different localities will pay different amounts. That problem has been masked by the notion of uniform pricing. That sounds quite acceptable, but the water quangos will be able to do as they wish and impose charges that need have no relationship to people's ability to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have spoken about poor households. The crazy system of disconnections and metering imposes hardship in England and Wales, and that is bad enough, but the system to be imposed on poor Scots households will be a halfway house before the private sector takes over. Our warning to the Government is that we shall take the matter back to Scotland. There is no need for scaremongering. We shall tell the Scottish people that once the present system of 12 authorities that are accessible to their areas' electorate and consumers is abandoned, we shall move to a system in which three organisations, over which people will have no control, will set the new water charges. That will cost people hard cash.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does anyone need to be reminded that massive Tory tax hikes have been imposed this week? The Bill is virtually a charter for quangos to impose new water tax hikes which can be likened to the poll tax. The clause does not constrain the new water authorities in any way. That is very dangerous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a sad day when the Government do not take seriously the problems of disabled consumers and of poor households who already are working to the limits of their budgets. Government Back Benchers have made it clear that they support privatisation and that they consider metering to be a good idea. Conservative Members do not live in the real world, where 1 million Scots—one in five of the population—belong to families on income support. Is that fact to be dismissed by Conservative Members because it does not fit their ideology?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The response to the debate on this clause has been a scandal. It is outrageous that the Government should continue to operate as if the real world did not exist. Unless the Government change their mind, Scots will realise that not only do the Government treat them with contempt but that not one of the questions put in such a united fashion by the Opposition has been answered. That is why we shall press the amendments to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The scandal in the debate is the continuous misrepresentation of the Bill by the hon. Member for Fife, Central. It beggars belief that he should disbelieve everything that he is told. The inferences taken by the hon. Gentleman differ from those taken by almost every hon. Member. He ignores the fact that the price of water and sewerage has risen substantially over the past five years, as if local authorities had kept it at a minimum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0988">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1785</span>
He pretends that no one has to worry about the cost of water, when anyone who examines his council tax bill will know that the figure is very high. It is high time that the hon. Gentleman stopped trying to mislead the country that water is cheap and widely available at any time. That is not factual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I bring it home to the hon. Gentleman that water is an expensive commodity in Scotland, and the expense will increase steadily as it has over the past five years. If European directives are to be met, it is no use thinking that water will be cheaper in future. It will not; if anything, it will be more expensive, as it would be if the increase under local authorities continued. The cost goes up and up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want better value for money under the water authorities and I want those who are on low incomes or who need water for special purposes, about whom Opposition Members are rightly anxious, to be looked after. The customers council and the area committees will ensure that the decisions of the water authorities and of the Secretary of State are carried through properly. We shall have a fine and efficient water and sewerage service in Scotland. It is wrong of Opposition Members to carry on in the way that they have been doing morning, noon and night, because they do not know what they are talking about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. I cannot contain my anger because I will not be treated in such a way, albeit by an old parliamentary friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the medical issue, the Minister should read line 4 of page 54 of the Bill. It states "have regard to", which is no undertaking. He said that we have not been concerned about sewage. Charges for the treatment of trade effluent will not be subject to approval by the new customers council under clause 73(2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister reads clause 73(2), he will realise that I am right and he is wrong. The thrust of any trade effluent control scheme is to control polluting discharges to sewerage systems to prevent pollution and thereafter to charge not more than the cost of dealing with a pollution load.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill removes any need to control the level of charging. Does not the Minister think that that will give rise to unnecessarily high costs to industry, unless the legislation is amended to ensure that there is no change of emphasis from control on charging? For example, in the past 12 months Lothian has received approximately £3.5 million in trade effluent income. That sum reflects the cost of conveying and treating trade effluent. The Minister is plainly wrong in his answers and will forgive us for being extremely angry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to nail the politics and the practicalities of the matter. My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow is correct; in Committee we have listened to the most half-baked ideas that have come before
	<span class='label label-info column'>1786</span>
Parliament in the 15 years that the Tories have been in power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers have tried to justify issues that cannot be justified by objective means. The clause merely provides another building block for the privatisation of water. The three super-quangos will be given the right to do what they want with prices, and the only constraint is the Secretary of State, who is trusted possibly by only 30 per cent. of Scots public opinion and by no Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is deplorable that Parliament will pass a blank cheque to the super-quangos to implement pricing policies which need have no regard to the serious points that we have made. I warn the Minister and Conservative Members that we shall campaign vigorously on this issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People should know that they are not only being treated with contempt by the Tories, but being deceived at every opportunity. Charges will increase and households will be hit. The Opposition will not accept that. The Government should be warned of the consequences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>1788</span>
ultimately practical issue has exercised the minds of politicians here and is certainly a factor in Scottish public opinion. We want to reflect on the current position on disconnections in Scotland under the Water (Scotland) Act 1980. We want the Bill to include a commitment that there will be no disconnections for domestic consumers in Scotland. Our simple request is that the Government do not hide behind provisions in other legislation but that today they will include in the Bill a provision that there will be no disconnections in Scotland for domestic consumers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the Minister's attention to his remarks in our Committee proceedings on 29 March. In discussions on the issue of disconnections, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I shall consider the matter and see whether it is necessary to include a provision in the Bill."—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 29 March 1994; c. 1613.]</p></blockquote>
We hope that the Minister has reflected and that today he will accept our practical advice to include a provision in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People in Scotland are worried about disconnections. There are 56,037 reasons why there should be a provision relating to disconnections in Scotland. In the four years of the privatised system in England and Wales, that is how many people have had to endure the embarrassment, indignity, inconvenience and utter humilation of having their water supply disconnected. I see hon. Members suggesting that that is not so. Whatever the reasons for disconnection in England and Wales, we may have the same reasons in Scotland, but we simply do not disconnect. To do so is an obscenity; it is barbaric. Whether English and Welsh consumers think that domestic consumers should be disconnected is, in a sense, up to them, but we in Scotland have a civilised society that will not accept that. If it is good enough for the Scots, it should be good enough for English and Welsh consumers. It is a most important issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can talk about the natural right of people not to have their water supply disconnected as water is vital. My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow spoke about the health implications but, in the end, if we are not concerned about market place economics, surely the issue of disconnections is one of morality—the simple question in a civilised society of what is right and what is wrong. We argue, from a fundamental position, that it is wrong to have any circumstance in which the water supply to a family, household or single person can be disconnected. Surely all those on the Government Benches shold acknowledge that fundamental right of people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that it is wrong or right not to pay a water bill if one is able to pay it, and thus pass the burden on to other consumers? That is the situation in England. Those whose supply is disconnected are people who can but will not pay. By not paying, they place a burden on other users. Is that right or is it wrong?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even if I were to accept, which I do not, bogus arguments about England and Wales, is it really being said that 56,037 people can afford to pay but, as a matter of principle, do not pay? What a ridiculous a claim.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0990">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1789</span>
If it is so that people in England and Wales can pay but will not pay, why does that not happen in Scotland? What is the difference between the two cultures that means that Scots pay and that we have local authorities and a system of government that allow no disconnections? The hon. Gentleman cannot argue both ways. I believe that, in England and Wales, there are people in extreme hardship who simply do not have the money. I do not wish to digress, Sir James, but when we consider poor households in Britain, the Thatcher and Major years have been a disgrace. The poor have simply got poorer. To talk of water poverty in this so-called enterprise culture is a contradiction in terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not need lectures from English Members, who have allowed a privatised system to ride roughshod over consumers, disconnecting them if they cannot pay. We do not want that for Scotland, which is why we are asking the Government for a firmer assurance that they regard the matter seriously.

English and Welsh opinion in the past few years has contributed to disconnections beign reduced marginally. For two years, there were 21,000 and 18,000 disconnections, but the figures have decreased. All we ask is that the Minister write into the Bill an unequivocal commitment to no disconnections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall debate the issue of metering later. These days, fewer disconnections of gas and electricity supplies are officially recorded because metering provides self-disconnection, in private misery, behind the closed doors of households that cannot afford to pay. They are not recorded in official annual reports. Let us not forget that the issue of metering is fundamentally tied to disconnections and that the more poorer Scottish households go onto metering—as they do with electricity and its white boxes—the more they will find that they do not have the necessary 50p to spend on water so they will simply disconnect themselves. That must be avoided. The Minister must talk to us about metering and make it clear that, no matter what the circumstances of domestic consumers in terms of both unmeasured and measured water, the same no-disconnection principle will apply under the new water authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Trust is the key to the effective working of any organisation, political or other. Scottish public opinion generally trusts local and regional authorities and those who deal with water and sewerage services. Consequently, the duty placed on regional authorities to provide a supply of good water has always been to the fore. It does not take a genius to work out that if we move to three remote quangos staffed by people with no regard for the circumstances of specific areas, the link between the duty not to disconnect and the needs of their organisation will become tenuous, and bottom-line financial considerations may dominate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope for a positive response from the Minister, not for the Committee but for the Scottish people, who will feel outraged at the possibility of the new water quangos acting
	<span class='label label-info column'>1790</span>
against their wishes. If we make progress on this matter, it will prompt English and Welsh public opinion to grasp the nettle and realise that they need not suffer the indignity and obscenity of disconnections, that they can be like the people of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My name is attached to new clause 17. The Committee no doubt wishes to make progress to the point where we hear what the Minister has to say. I do not know whether he was teasing when he said that he had something in mind that might be to our advantage, but I do not wish to delay the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall make three brief points. If, as the Minister appears to say, the delivery of water service facilities north of the border is being retained in the public sector by means of the new water authorities—that it is still truly a public service—he must give us some concessions on disconnections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When operating in the Welsh, and particularly English, contexts, with commercial organisations delivering water supplies, certain courses of action may, in the brave new world of private companies and profits, have to be left open to those companies, however much they are controlled by standards and statutory regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They may well be permitted to disconnect supplies. If England and Wales want to permit that, it is a matter for them. I am certain that an acid test of the retention of the service in the public sector is the capacity to set it up in a way that denies the water authority the power to disconnect supply. New clause 17 is intended the achieve that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any case, if the water service is to be a public service, disconnections are a short-sighted policy. The cutting off a supply to individuals who do not pay deprives households of water. Dependants, such as spouses and children, suffer the same consequences. All sorts of costs relating to public health and hygiene will be incurred downsteam of the disconnection. The health service will pick up the bill in the longer-term by having to treat illnesses that would not otherwise arise. Disconnections are not a sensible course, even from an economic viewpoint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, if people are deliberately flouting legitimate charges so that it is clear that they are simply not willing to pay, although they are able to, suitable procedures are available. They may not be familiar to hon. Members who represent English constituencies, because the law of debt collection—poinding or wage arrestment—is substantially different in Scotland. We cannot—rightly—send people to prison for non-payment of debts, whereas I believe that that option is still open south of the border. There are many ways in which the water authorities would be able to hold to account those water users who deliberately and wilfully refused to pay or delayed in paying, water charges that they were able to meet. If Sheriff Paterson, who sits at Jedburgh and Duns sherriff courts, came across any such persons, against whom any authority had taken action, I am sure that he would give them short shrift. The water authorities will have plenty of opportunities to recover any legitimate charges that they consider are wilfully being ignored. I do not, in any case, believe that there is any need
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0991">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1791</span>
for disconnections. The money can be recovered by other means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons and for all the others to which the hon. Member for Fife, Central adverted earlier, I believe that the Committee requires the Government to be more forthcoming about the protection against disconnection that the Bill contains. If the Minister can reassure us that the Government will consider the matter, and if the amendments are in any way technically incompetent, I shall be happy for the Government to deliberate and to produce, later in the progress of the Bill, something that will give us greater reassurance that disconnections will never be visited on the population of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a natural community of interest in Scotland and an abhorrence of the thought of water disconnections. The amendments are intended to hammer home that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to speak to amendment No. 566, which was tabled before, and is similar in content and purpose to the other amendments. It would provide that
	<br><blockquote><p>"No water or sewerage authority may disconnect or threaten to disconnect the water supply from a householder in pursuit of a claim for payment due."</p></blockquote>
Its purpose is to ensure that no individuals' or families' domestic water suppliers will be disconnected. I do not want visited on Scotland the obscenities that occurred in England with regard to such domestic disconnections. The answer to the point raised by the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) is that water is not like any other commodity. It is essential, and there is no substitute for it. People who have their electricity supply cut off can use Calor gas for heating. People who have their gas supply cut off can cook on a primus stove. It would be awkward and inconvenient, but it is possible. Water is in a different and essential category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In England, rising prices and privatisation have led to a dramatic rise in the number of disconnections. They have tripled, reaching about 21,000 in 1991ߝ92. That means that 21,000 households have had their domestic water supply disconnected. The horror stories from England should be warning enough that this should never be allowed to happen in Scotland. It is unthinkable that people with children, elderly people and those with special needs should suffer by not having a readily available supply of domestic water. Health reasons should ensure that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Financial reasons are also involved. Low wages and unemployment should never be reasons for water disconnection. Indeed, it is in the poorer areas of our communities that domestic water supplies must be guaranteed for the continuing health and welfare of the people who live there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I never want to see the so-called self-disconnections, that have been all too evident in England, take place in Scotland, whether through metering or a card system. It simply should not happen. The amendment would ensure that such an eventuality would never be visited on any family or individual in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1792</span>
The Government may think that the amendment is not necessary, but that is not good enough. They have introduced plenty of belt and braces provisions in their legislation. Accepting the amendment to ensure that no disconnections take place would be such a belt and braces provision that disconnection would not be used as a means of enforcing debt payment, especially when other methods were available. The water authorities would know that and so would the consumers: it would be in the Bill, clear and above board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974, it is illegal for a work place to be without a constant supply of clean running water. The same provision should also apply to every domestic household in Scotland. The amendment would guarantee that a supply of clean running water for domestic use was available to all citizens. Once such a provision was in the Bill, everyone would know the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will accept the amendment and ensure that written into the Bill is a guarantee that there will be no disconnections of domestic water supplies in Scotland. The proposal is fair, and it makes common sense. I hope that it will be written into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Daly ell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to ask one succint, factual, calm question. I am one of the two lay members—the other is Dr. Ingram—of the biological sciences advisory committee of the University of Edinburgh.

I make no criticism whatever of Professor Kendall and observe that the Scottish Office is lucky to have such a distinguished man as its chief medical officer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has the Minister or his staff been asked at any time over the past nine months or a year to look critically at the English experience? The hon. Member for Angus, East spoke about horror stories. For all I know, some may be exaggerated. However, I know at first hand from my parliamentary colleagues that some are not, certainly in respect of Sheffield and Bradford. Has the Scottish Office gone to the trouble of asking about the English experience? I hope to heaven that the answer is yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I will be relating in this short speech, we are not following the English experience. We are going down our own route, as we always have with the important issue of disconnection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to recognise the present position, which the Secretary of State and I have made clear a number of times over the past year during Scottish questions. There is, and will continue to be, a duty on water authorities, subject to tests of practicability and reasonable cost, to supply householders with water. That duty does not permit the supply to be disconnected. The law allows disconnection for operational reasons under paragraph 41 of schedule 4 of the Water (Scotland) Act 1980 and at the request of a householder under paragraph 40 of schedule 4 when the premises are to be unoccupied. That position will continue. It is unnecessary to reinforce it with further legislation. The legal position is clear.

Having said that—I shall choose my words with care, because the hon. Member for Hamilton is adept at quoting me out of context and placing a different inference on my words—I emphasise that I express the Government's view, which does not constitute a U-turn or change of heart. The legal position has not changed. The hon. Gentleman can jot down, "No U-turn". Otherwise, he will rush out to his friends in the Corridor to say that the Government have done a U-turn. We have not done a U-turn. We shall include in the Bill a provision that will make the position clear. There can be no disconnections of domestic supplies in Scotland. We shall table a new clause to that effect today so that we may debate it with the other new clauses next week. I hope that the Committee will be pleased. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire spoke about new clause 17 with great sincerity. When the new clause is tabled, it will be clear that domestic supplies in Scotland cannot be disconnected. The amendments simply try to reinforce the current position. They are unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, Central mentioned the important issue of using meters in domestic properties is voluntary. People do not need to have a meter unless they wish to have one. However, trade and business premises canbe required to havemeters. The hon. Gentlemanmade an interesting point about pre-payment meters. It could be argued that it is not legal to have such meters. By pre-paying, one is introducing a condition for supplying the water. It would be illegal for any authority to have pre-payment meters and introduce an extra condition of supplying water to the domestic consumer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad about that. Does that preclude a card system of metering, whereby one buys cards and credits and puts them in a meter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whether one pays by card or cash, one is still paying for water before one gets it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the installation of meters would be voluntary. Is that reversible? Would it be possible for a consumer to get rid of a meter that was installed by a previous occupier, or even by himself?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I think it would. In the case of a change of occupancy or circumstances, a domestic consumer could ask to have the meter removed. I wonder whether I can have one removed because I am no longer a dairy farmer. That would be a saving of water which was used in large quantities for cooling milk years ago. I am told that it will be made clear that it is illegal to insist on pre-payment meters. It is right that we should look carefully into the matter and I am glad that the hon. Member for Fife, Central raised it because the public should know what the position is. I shall table a clause before we consider new clauses to make it clear that domestic disconnection is not legal in Scotland. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel that he can withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the Minister has examined the matter and is prepared to produce a new clause. I warmly welcome that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1794</span>
There is one matter that I inadvertently forgot to mention which the Minister may wish to consider. I have at least one constituent whose water comes from England. I am sure that the Minister will not have an answer to such a technical question on cross-boundary supplies on the tip of his tongue, but perhaps somebody could look into the matter and give us an assurance that the law of Scotland will apply on disconnections for people who are being served from England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a spectacular change in Government thinking. It reinforces the value of public opinion, which can move the Conservative party from positions that it has adopted and stuck by.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the difference?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Recently, the Minister commented on the new provision when he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At the moment, I see no reason why that should be done even though I have considered that point since lunchtime"—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 29 March 1994; c. 1613.]</p></blockquote>
He has obviously had time to reflect on the strength of public opinion and the strength of the Opposition view in Committee. It shows that democracy works. When we have raised issues with the backing of public opinion, the Government have backtracked spectacularly. We welcome that and we look forward to the new clause that will clear up any doubts that Scots may have about disconnections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Tories now have a major problem, because their colleagues in England and Wales will want to know why Scottish legislation can have a no-disconnection clause when the 56,037 people in England and Wales who have been disconnected make their sacrifices in vain. That is a problem for the Conservative party. We are happy that the concession has been wrung from the Government and we sincerely hope that there will be no more equivocation so that we can have some further concessions on the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be curmudgeonly, but I should like clarification of the small print and of what exactly has been undertaken. I have listened carefully to the Minister and I do not think that I am distorting his words. The legal position is clear: there will be no disconnections for domestic supply. How does that differ from non-domestic supply?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the problem of how water boards put pressure on people for pre-payment. We all know from our constituency experience with the electricity supply that considerable pressure for pre-payment can be put on some households. Has that been considered? I do not want to be difficult. These are practical, serious questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the position on the domestic meter option? An option for domestic meters to be installed in private households was introduced 12 months ago since when, I am told by Lothian region, only one householder in Lothian has taken up the option. The total for Scotland is apparently 10. The council asks whether the Minister
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0993">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1795</span>
considers that to be another clear indication that the people in Scotland do not wish to see any change in the method of provision of water and sewerage services. That valid question must be addressed. There may be a convincing answer, and I should like to hear it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When my hon. Friend the Minister for Dundee, East described the Minister's announcement of a new clause as a spectacular change by the Government, he was taunted by the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr Robertson) who said, "What change?" If there is no change, why is it necessary for the Minister to introduce a new clause? There has been a significant change by the Government. Having persistently refused, since the Committee began 11 weeks ago, to make any concessions on the Bill, they have now, under public pressure, given way and agreed to include in a new clause a provision that there can be no disconnections in Scotland. It would be wrong if Opposition Members did not welcome the Governments decision to back down, show a little common sense and listen to what people in Scotland are saying. I only wish they would do that in respect of all the other issues in the Bill that we have debated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that in favour of the Government, I question how far they have made concessions to public opinion in Scotland. My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow spoke about the small print. When we began this debate, the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire said that he wanted a guarantee that disconnections would never take place in Scotland. I am not clear whether the Minister's concession means that there can never be any disconnections in Scotland in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want a commitment from the Minister that not only is it illegal to disconnect domestic consumers from the water supply in Scotland but that it will remain illegal as long as the Conservative Government are in office. I do not believe that that is the position of the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), who gave an interview to the 	<i>Dundee Courier and Advertiser</i> on Monday in which he referred to disconnections from the water supply. As usual, he argued that the Labour party was scaremongering and raising spectres of disconnections. He said that the Labour party
	<br><blockquote><p>"raised the spectre of water disconnections—knowing full well that these are not legally possible now"—</p></blockquote>
that word "now" is significant—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and, as the legislation is not being changed, clearly not possible in the future."</p></blockquote>
There are two qualifications there. Everybody accepts that it is not illegal to disconnect domestic consumers at present. We are worried about the future position. The Under-Secretary makes that difference clear. He says that it is not illegal now, with the implication that it may become illegal at some point in the future under a Conservative Government. He even says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"as the legislation is not being changed".</p></blockquote>
It is not being changed now, so disconnections will remain illegal in the future too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1796</span>
We must remember that the Under-Secretary who is an honourable man and is trusted by Opposition Members, has to follow a Scottish Office time scale. I do not believe that he is seeking re-election in the 1996 election. I should be surprised if he were, and his family would be even more surprised. He will be replaced at some point in the future, and it is then that we shall start to worry whether a future Minister will introduce changes in the Scottish legal system which allow disconnections. I want to be sure that this is not simply a personal commitment by this Minister but a commitment by the Conservative Government for now and for ever so that at no point in the future, no matter what changes take place, will the Government consider changing the law in Scotland to bring it into line with the law in England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would find it hard to swallow if a party which claims to be favour of a unitary Westminister Parliament, which shrinks from the idea of Scotland being different from England and Wales and which believes that we must all be subject to the same social and economic laws passed by this unitary Westminister Parliament, told me that it would tolerate disconnections in England and Wales and not in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the hon. Member for Angus, East, I am upset because five English Members in the Committee are making such changes, but I am equally upset because six Scottish Tory Members are also making them. Five English and six Scottish Members support disconnections in England and Wales. They have made a concession as a result of fierce public pressure in Scotland in advance of the regional council elections when the Conservative party is threatened with being wiped out, but what will happen in the longer term?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sooner or later, the logic is that the Government will treat Scotland in the same way as they treat England and Wales. The only guarantee for people in Scotland that there will be no disconnections in future is to ensure that they elect a Labour Government at the next election who will establish a Scottish Parliament. Then they can be sure that there will never be disconnections in Scotland. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am told that there are seven Scottish Tories in the Committee. Perhaps I cannot count.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that metering was completely voluntary and that the water boards would not be allowed to introduce meters in Scotland except with the agreement of domestic consumers. How can he say that when he said in an earlier debate that the water boards must be free to decide the charging schemes that they would introduce? If they are to be completely free to decide that, surely that implies that they are free to decide on a form of metering in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That does not necessarily mean that they will impose metering on people who are currently connected to the water and sewerage supplies in Scotland, but the privatised water companies in England and Wales are making it a condition that newly built houses in their areas must take metered water supplies. I want a guarantee from the Government that when new houses are constructed anywhere in Scotland, none of the water boards will be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0994">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1797</span>
able to tell the builders, "You must instal metered supplies in those houses." Otherwise, it could lead to the piecemeal introduction of meters in Scotland and a two tier system of water and sewerage supplies.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. It seems to me that your comments apply to the hon. Member for Angus, East who may be a little repetitive when speaking. However, he expresses himself in a quality manner and with a lot of compassion and integrity. In many ways, his performance is a great improvement on that of other Opposition Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order for the Chair. I find all Scots very compassionate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The specific point is that the Minister said that it would be illegal to insist on pre-payment but would voluntary pre-payment be legal? If it were truly voluntary there would be no problem, but if it were voluntary under pressure from the water boards, that would be a different matter and we would be no further forward. We must judge what the Government have done when we see the text. I hope that there will be do ifs, buts or the possibility of disconnections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For all the thanks that I got from the hon. Member for Dundee, East I might as well not have tabled my new clause. I should make it clear to him and the hon. Member for Linlithgow that there is no small print. There will be no disconnections from domestic water supplies. That is a different issue from trade, business and commercial supplies, which have always been liable for disconnection because they are usually arranged between the local authority and the customer. That has not changed; nor has the issue of disconnection. All that we are doing is emphasising the Government's position on disconnection by including it in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to everything that the Minister has said and I have no reservations. I accept unequivocally that he has given a pledge about
	<span class='label label-info column'>1798</span>
disconnections. He is speaking on behalf of the Government and I thank him unreservedly. I thank, too, the five English Members because they are giving to Scotland a provision that their own constituents do not have. I wonder what they will tell their constituents in Blackpool, Leeds, Stroud, and other areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, concur with the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish). I echo what was said earlier, that this debate has been an excellent example of non-strenuous Monro banging—we would have been unlikely to pull our ankle, although people in Scotland may think that the Minister was pulling their legs when he said that nothing has changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great deal has changed. Last night on the Floor of the House, a Minister gave a derisory reply to a 91 minute debate on criminal trespass, when he said that he was afraid of new age travellers coming from the south of England to Scotland if we did not have the same law. My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central gave a good example when he said that in Scotland there is no legal right to cut off water supplies, but that there is no tendency for people to refuse to pay their water bills in Scotland. But in England and Wales, there is a law allowing disconnections and the problem is rising. As my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central said, it is about people's reactions to poverty and making choices about either feeding themselves or paying bills to outside bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all receive bills. I have one from Thames Water utilities, which comes from Swindon. I pay almost the same water charges for a four-bedroomed house in Scotland as I do for a one-bedroomed flat in England. I know from my neighbours in London that if I were to fall into difficulty with paying, the final sanction would be the withdrawal of a vital life-giving source, and all the problems that would come from that with its effect on children, and so on. I hope that the Minister realises that inserting a specific clause is significant. It is wrong to thank a Minister for what he is doing to the water supplies in Scotland, with all the consequences that we can predict. In his retirement, he will see that prediction come true. It will greatly increase the costs to consumers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not reply to the points that I made about finance. My prediction on finance will come true. The Government's contribution will decrease. The contribution from revenue is 60 per cent. for capital projects in England and Wales, whereas it is only 25 per cent. in Scotland. It will increase to 60 per cent, of the capital that is paid for out of revenue by Scottish domestic consumers and they will face the same problems of poverty. Later, I hope that we shall debate the question of the role of local authorities. Every local authority in Scotland will be a charging authority. Even though there will be no disconnections, they should make a clear statement that they will not resort to the courts and sheriff's officers in chasing people for the hugely inflated bills from water boards. They must not use the courts or sheriff's officers to seize people's income, pension funds, building society accounts or bank accounts. There may be no disconnections, but the regime used to introduce the poll tax still exists to threaten the people of Scotland. I hope that the Minister will not attempt to force

	<span class='label label-info column'>1799</span>
local authorities to use draconian measures to gather the hugely inflated charges which I have no doubt will result from the Government's real scheme for water under the new water boards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to place on record the House's congratulations to Strathclyde regional council for conducting a referendum that showed so clearly Scots' hostility to the Government's proposals that they have been obliged to make not a U-turn but a somersault on the question of disconnections. The vote in Strathclyde has forced the Government to respond in that way, and I am sure that I speak for my hon. Friends when I congratulate Strathclyde on its action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a Lothian MP, rather than a Strathclyde MP, may I add my own strong congratulations to Strathclyde on what it has achieved? I accept in good faith what the Minister has said. However, I cannot contain my curiosity. Surely the introduction of the new clause must have been cleared with other Government Departments, or at least with a Cabinet committee. Taken at face value, it would appear to be an issue of policy that would have to have been referred to the Cabinet itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Minister cannot say exactly what happened inside the Government machine, but surely the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer), the Secretary of State for the Environment, who is a good interrogator, asked some questions about the new clause. The Minister was a distinguished and helpful Minister at the Department of the Environment. He knows that Department well. What on earth did Marsham street say to the Scottish Office? More interestingly, what did the Scottish Office say in reply to colleagues in Marsham street?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley is right to say that this is not a matter for the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1800</span>
English members of the Committee. It is a matter for people at the heart of the Government. Surely the new clause had to be cleared. It was cleared, was it not? We are told that a new clause of this sort is to be introduced but was it cleared by other Departments? All the Minister has to do to shut me up is to tell me that it was cleared by other Departments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall gladly do that. I am amazed that the hon. Gentleman, who wears his years of experience in the House so frequently on his sleeve, should ask whether a Government new clause has been cleared. That it has been cleared shows the strength of the Secretary of State for Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is precisely the length of my parliamentary tooth that prompts me to ask that question. I hope that it is crystal clear that the Department of Environment and its officials have agreed to the measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has been in the House long enough to know how Governments work, even if he has not been fortunate enough to be a Minister. All his years with Mr. Richard Crossman must have taught him how Governments proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Government's climbdown, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
