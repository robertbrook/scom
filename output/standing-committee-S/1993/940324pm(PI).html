	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. At the commencement of this morning's sitting, you were kind and brave in using your judgment to concede the need for a debate—you were probably right in saying that it should be confined to an hour—to discuss this unique procedural motion. The Minister said that it was not unique, but it is unique for a Chairman to use his judgment to allow such an Opposition motion. I know that you must have thought very carefully about the circumstances. We were grateful to you for that, Mr. Martin, but we knew that exercising that judgment presented problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You must be gratified, Mr. Martin, that not only did you receive the congratulations of the Opposition at that time, but have now had your decision endorsed by the Government because Conservative Members—including four Ministers—voted that the debate on the procedural motion should continue. I hope that the record will show that, having made our point and having received none of the assurances that we had sought, the Opposition wish
	<span class='label label-info column'>1464</span>
to move on to discuss the substance of the Bill so that we may hear from the Government precisely what they propose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, Conservative Members have chosen to vote us down and, although some of them may not realise it, they have voted to allow the debate on the procedural motion to rearrange the order of consideration to continue. How much easier it would have been for the Government simply to accept the motion rather than take this procedural route, which makes them look complete idiots.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Sir Hector Monro)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Let me say to the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) that I do not need endorsements of my decisions. I exercised my judgment this morning and the Committee has, by a majority, exercised its judgment, by which I shall abide. I hope that we have no further discussion about the vote and can get on with the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I should respond to the comments of the hon. Member for Hamilton regarding the decision that we have just made. Once the Opposition had decided to go down the foolhardy road of a procedural motion, it was only correct—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To keep it going.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) makes the most ludicrous comments throughout our proceedings. All members of the Committee have the right to express their views. Several Conservative Members wish to bring home to the Opposition the foolhardiness of the course on which they have embarked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped that the debate would be brief, but I accept that the Committee has made its decision and I am in its hands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. I think that the Government have put you in a difficult position. Can you advise me on the technicalities of our position? Having accepted and disposed of the question that the question be put, am I right in thinking that it would be unusual for the Chair to consider a further motion for closure until at least a two-hour period has elapsed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a matter of judgment. Unusual things happen in Scottish Committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Kynoch 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. Does not it make the position of the hon. Member for Hamilton strange that, after calling for the debate, he has tried to stifle it because he does not like hearing what Conservative Members have to say?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely no problem for me. I turn up to chair a Committee and that is what I am doing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0812">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1465</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Will you confirm that it would be in order for the Minister to make another statement? He concentrated his speech this morning on why we should discuss the amendments and stop this nonsensical debate. We hoped to get out of this procedural motion a statement on the Government's position on the referendum and whether they will listen to the wishes of the people of Strathclyde. Instead, the Minister made an assault on the procedural motion itself. Should not the Minister now give us his opinion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a matter for me. It is my experience that hon. Members' contributions and voting habits do not necessarily marry up. That is for the judgment of hon. Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch) was wrong: it was not a Government Back Bencher who was speaking; it was me. My hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South (Mr. McMaster) has given me an absolute, categorical, unequivocal, clear and definite assurance that their was nothing personal in his moving the question. I accept that assurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman misquoted me. I was referring to the fact that Conservative Members still had views to express. I suggested that the Opposition wanted to close the debate because they did not like what they were hearing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I enjoyed what I was hearing. It was a remarkable exhibition of—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Squirming.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, squirming. We heard apologies from the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) and rants from the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson). We are in an Alice in wonderland world. It is perhaps more like "Through the Looking-Glass". The Government have now voted for further discussion. I can assume only that they did so because they want more time to think about the referendum. When I asked the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro) what consideration he had given to the referendum, he said that he had been thinking about it all the time since it took place. I can understand that. It was an astonishing result and took him by surprise. Perhaps he now needs longer to consider it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the explanation for this remarkable, puzzling and mysterious occurrence lie in the Prime Minister's answer, given in the Chamber this afternoon, to the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie)? Was my hon. Friend as astonished as I was that when the hon. Lady asked whether the Prime Minister would listen to the views of the people of Strathclyde—and, indeed, of Scotland—he bizarrely said that no alternative had been put forward in the referendum or in the opinion polls and that therefore the Government had to go ahead with their crazy plan for three quangos? Could somebody have pointed out, as the Prime Minister was leaving the Chamber, a package of amendments is down on the amendment paper in the name of Labour Members, for debate after the motion
	<span class='label label-info column'>1466</span>
has been disposed of, that would provide for a clear-cut, logical and well-thought-out alternative to the Government's plan? Could not the Prime Minister at this very moment be huddled downstairs with the absent Secretary of State for Scotland, with a view to sending an emissary into the Room to pass a message to the Minister, reading, "You can now go on—we have changed our minds. Accept the Opposition's alternative because it makes sense"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Alternatives exist and we are here to put them forward. They are workable. Perhaps a joint board, of which councillors would be members, along the lines of the police or fire boards, or similar structures that we have suggested, would be suitable options. The Government need time to consider that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can only presume that since the Government voted against my hon. Friend's motion that the Question be now put, they need more time. If they need more time this afternoon to hear our arguments, I hope that after the debate, when they have heard them, they will vote with us—thus allowing themselves time to consider them. If, having heard all that has been said this morning and afternoon, we proceed to debate clause 61 straight away, no such time will have been allowed to the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend is right and that the Tories are terrified of the real issues. Will he comment on the fact that earlier this afternoon the Prime Minister dismissed the views of 1.2 million people in Strathclyde as an expensive stunt, and not particularly relevant? Does not that go beyond even the contempt, arrogance and authoritarianism of what we have heard from the Conservative Benches?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely right. I used those very terms—arrogance and contempt. I have two genuine worries. The Government regularly show contempt for Parliament and its procedures. Now contempt has been shown for the wishes of 1.2 million people in Strathclyde. That is outrageous. Before lunch I said that we operate in a democratic structure. Representations are made to the Government in various ways—through consultation procedures, direct representations to Ministers, deputations and letters, but nothing could be more overwhelming, spectacular or convincing than the verdict given in the referendum. Surely the Government must take some account of the verdict of so many people of Strathclyde.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand what will be lost by the delay that we seek. I respect the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Dumfries, for his experience, his humour and his kindly ways, and for the contrast between him and the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart); a contrast that brings to mind Jekyll and Hyde—and we know which is which. I listened carefully to the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Dumfries, but with all the good will in the world—and I was listening with good will—I cannot understand why a delay is a problem. What will be lost by it? There is a great deal to be gained by swapping the debates. We can progress properly, efficiently and effectively with less contentious issues. While we do that in Committee, the Government can give some time to considering the result of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0813">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1467</span>
Strathclyde referendum. That is sensible and logical. I have heard no reasons against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an extremely good point. On my way to our proceedings, I discovered that the Local Government Commission for England, which is reviewing local government boundaries and functions, will conduct a household survey in every area. It will present several options to all households at public expense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Atkinson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says no. I received the information, which seems to be public knowledge, from Sir John Banham, the chairman of the Local Government Commission for England. He is about to make a television programme on the subject. When the survey is completed, will the Prime Minister denounce it as an expensive stunt?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It depends on the result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hexham says that it depends on the result. Therein lies the answer to our questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I am also grateful for the series of distinguished and knowledgeable interventions. My hon. Friend has shown that the Government are at sixes and sevens.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Wait a minute. England has an independent commission; we do not. Sir John Banham will undertake Government-sponsored consultation in England. But the Prime Minister describes such consultation in Scotland as an expensive stunt. The hon. Member for Hexham supports consultation only if he knows that the result will favour the Government. We could not predict the result of the Strathclyde referendum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If you believe that, Mr. Martin, you will believe anything. I shall correct the hon. Member for Hamilton. The Local Government Commission for England will carry out a public opinion survey of a small sample to find with which local authority people's loyalties lie. It is not a household survey. It is a small dip into public opinion to ascertain the authority to which people feel closest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an excellent suggestion. Perhaps we could undertake such a survey in Ayrshire. I hope that the Minister listens to the hon. Member for Hexham and perhaps acts on that suggestion. I would welcome that. The principle that I described remains: in England, consultation occurs and an independent commission exists, but in Scotland, Ministers decide everything and pay attention to no one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sir John Banham told me that a survey of all households would be carried out. That can be checked. The Committee can believe the hon. Member
	<span class='label label-info column'>1468</span>
for Hexham or Sir John Banham, but a study of opinion will occur. The proposed order of consideration will give the Government an opportunity to consider the Strathclyde referendum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know the account that I believe. My hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton has spoken to Sir John Banham today. I am sure that my hon. Friend has up-to-date, accurate information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had intended to conclude my remarks before lunch. I wish to add one last thing. There was a letter from a constituent waiting in my office this afternoon. The letter is from a Mrs. Newbould in Maybole, who wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"With regard to the referendum on our water in Strathclyde"—</p></blockquote>
the use of the word "our" shows that people identify with their water. I hope that the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Knapman) is listening, because he wondered whether people in Glasgow were talking about such matters. They are talking about the matter in Maybole, and writing to their Member of Parliament about it. The letter continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am one of those who voted against the Government's proposals. We are told that the Bill has already had its second reading and nothing now can be done about it. This fact appears to be all important. Does this mean that it does not matter what the people want any longer?"</p></blockquote>
That is a good question. Does it mean that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I understand the hon. Gentleman correctly, his correspondent clearly had not had it explained to her that the Government's proposals had yet to be debated in Committee. It appears that she has been misled about the water proposals and that there is a big question mark over the whole referendum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is an old saying that fools rush in where angels fear to tread.I know Mrs. Newbould, and she has a far better understanding of what is going on than the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not my hon. Friend agree that Conservative Members seem to consider the Strathclyde referendum as a test that 1.2 million people have failed? Is not that the height of hypocrisy and arrogance on the part of a Government who have been in power for far too long?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I shall read one more sentence from Mrs. Newbould's letter. She writes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Yet I am of the impression that it is our basic right that a majority vote should be carried out."</p></blockquote>
She is absolutely right. I am sure that all Opposition Members will receive similar letters when we go back to our constituencies. I hope that Conservative Members will too, and some English Members as well. Over the weekend and over Easter, hon. Members of all persuasions should take soundings among their people. I am sure that they will find the attitude is the same as that displayed by Mrs. Newbould. People want democracy to be taken account of. They want their water—Mrs. Newbould called it "our" water—to remain under democratic control.

The referendum produced an astounding response and an even more astounding result. That is why Ministers

	<span class='label label-info column'>1469</span>
do not know what to do and why they voted against the Question being put. They are shell shocked, and in a total shambles. The future of many Scottish Conservative Members is on the line and they know it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should correct my hon. Friend on one point. He is right that 11 of the 12 Conservative Members are shell shocked by the result of the Strathclyde referendum. The hon. Member for Eastwood displays a combination of a man who is shell shocked and one who is getting used to it. In a referendum held in Barrhead, Neilston, Uplawmoor and Ralston about 80 per cent. of people voted against his proposals. A vote to opt-out Paisley grammar school produced a similar negative result. He is getting used to it by now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. The hon. Member for Eastwood seems to be a jinx on these referendums.

I should not like to be a Tory candidate in the regional elections in May, or a Tory candidate for the Euro elections in June. They will suffer a backlash to the arrogance and contempt displayed by the Government. They will richly deserve it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Knapman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stroud)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to overcome my shell shock for just a few moments. I am rather surprised that Opposition Members do not want more debate on the referendum. This morning, they seemed to want to go into every detail of it. The debate is really about whether the Labour party wishes to see powers taken away from the local authority. I find no very great surprise there. I have never known a time when the Labour party would take away any power from any local authority or from Parliament, other than perhaps in European matters. They are clause IV men, both in local authority and national terms.

The most suitable person to comment on the attitude of Opposition Members is almost certainly Machiavelli, who said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is nothing more difficult to plan and nothing more difficult of success nor more dangerous to manage than the creation of a new system because defenders of the status quo are invariably more vociferous than the supporters of change."</p></blockquote>
That seems the precise position here. I will not labour the point, but it could be that the vested interests are having some little part to play in what Opposition Members say. I seem to remember that immediately before our five minute break this morning, the outcry from the Public Gallery and an Opposition Member was, "We are the Strathclyde regional council." Those were the words that caused the delay in our proceedings this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I doubt that 	<i>Hansard</i> reported it, the words were, "We are the Members of Parliament for Strathclyde". With the exception of two hon. Members, that is what they were and they had a right to feel that they and their constituents were being ignored.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened very carefully and I did not take it that way. As it will not be on the record, we shall have to differ on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman tell the Committee which part of Scotland he represents?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1470</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hamilton has graciously acknowledged that as a Member of Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, I have as much right to be on this Committee as the hon. Member for Dundee, East. I admire him for saying that—I suspect that it is more than we could get out of some of his hon. Friends. If the hon. Member for Dundee, East disagrees with his hon. Friend, he should make that clear. I admire the hon. Member for Hamilton; he is absolutely right to make that point. Even if it makes him unpopular with members of his party, I am sure that he will continue to say it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also listened this morning to the other minority parties. The hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) spoke about how important it was for hon. Members to be representative and not delegates. One trawl through the Register of Members' Interests will show him that he has got that absolutely wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The details of the bill have been known since 9 December 1993. I must tell the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) that the time for reflection has been since that date. If he and his hon. Friends have only just cottoned on to what the Bill says, it is not the Government's fault. He admits in public that despite his professed concern for his constituents and Scotland in general, he has ignored the whole matter for months on end. He suddenly panics at the last moment and has this emergency debate, half way through it, he wants to guillotine it. That is an absolute disgrace. That is on the record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a lot on the record; I am looking forward to reading it. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman knows which of us are from Strathclyde constituencies. That would be an interesting test to set him. Is it not normal and right that a Government should take account of new information? Is not the result of the referendum one of the most spectacular pieces of new information on that issue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed we should consider the issue of a referendum. I agree with the hon. Member for Hamilton, but not with other Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning, the hon. Member for Hamilton finished his speech by saying that the public had been consulted and had spoken and it would be wrong to say that they did not understand. In other words, we should take note of the referendum. That is this year's view. This morning, I asked about the Labour party's view last year on the subject of referendums. When I quoted from the speech of the hon. Member for Hamilton he said that I had taken his words out of context. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is flattered that I have a copy of his speech from last year. He finished his speech by saying that he made the point that many other had made in the debate. I fear that many hon. Members in all parts of the House made the same point. The hon. Gentleman said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Those who cry loudest about Parliament handing over sovereignty to Brussels … happen also to be those who are most keen to hand over sovereignty on this and probably many other issues, to the rule of the plebiscite."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 21 April 1993; Vol. 223, 	<i>c.</i> 464.]</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman seems to hold a different view today from the one that he held last year. Last year's view
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0815">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1471</span>
was confirmed because he rightly voted according to his concience at that time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not saying that the Government must be tied by this or any other referendum. Our reasonable point is that we rearrange the timetabling of the Bill so that the Government may take account of the view expressed by the people of Strathclyde in that referendum. That is new information, but only inasmuch as it endorses what we already knew to be the opinion of the Scottish people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Prime Minister mistakenly said that there was no alternative to put before the House of Commons. We are simply saying to the Government, "Let us deal with the rest of the Bill and allow the Prime Minister to catch up with the facts." We have proposed a package of amendments. Asking the Government to take account of the referendum is not inconsistent with my comments last year about a referendum on the Maastricht treaty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asks that we take account of the referendum. That is precisely what the Committee will soon be doing. There is a galaxy of talent on the Government Front Bench who have already admitted that they have been studying the referendum results. Over the next few days, they will give the hon. Gentleman replies to all his questions. I keep making the mistake of calling them Ministers when they are in fact Under-Secretaries—I want to promote them all because they have perfectly answered the questions posed in the Committee. That is why they have the solid support of all Conservative Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend believe that a significant proportion of the people who participated in the referendum actually know what the Bill contains?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. This morning's debate clearly revealed that my hon. Friends have misgivings about the way in which the referendum may have been conducted. They know much about it and I shall not go into it at this stage. The Scottish press considered that it was a judgment on privatisation. Those of us who have read the Bill assiduously and who know every dot and comma—unlike the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley who is still reflecting on it—realise that there is no breath of privatisation in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I get the hon. Gentleman's comments clear. Earlier, he outlined the fact that the Government's proposal had been available since 9 December 1993. He said that since that date people in Strathclyde have completely failed to grasp the Government's proposals and that not only has the campaign misled them, but they have misled themselves for over a year. He also said that the Scottish press has
	<span class='label label-info column'>1472</span>
misled them. The hon. Gentleman must accept that people in Strathclyde are able to think for themselves. They have considered the proposals and they have decisively rejected them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is entitled to put that view during our proceedings. If the press in Scotland, not all of which is unfriendly to the Labour party, has taken the view that the referendum was about privatisation—it is not—that must answer the hon. Gentleman's question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Davidson) made an interesting omission. He said that "not only the campaign misled them", so he appears to accept that the campaign misled people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for pointing that out. It will be a good debating point at the appropriate time. The hon. Member for Govan will put that straight during the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point was that the hon. Gentleman has alleged that not only the campaign, but the press misled the people. I did not suggest for a moment that the campaign run by Strathclyde Labour party and by community organisations in Strathclyde misled the people. The campaign spelt out what they and I genuinely believe to be the position—the Government proposals are the first step on the road to privatisation. That is what I and the people believe. That is why they rejected the proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say how thrilled I am to have voted in the way that I did. It has given the hon. Member for Govan the chance to explain his position and to put the record straight. It has also enabled his hon. Friends to continue their reflections. I do not know whether they like what they see, but we have more time to debate the issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman mentioned me earlier and said that I was wrong when I said that the classical view of Members of Parliament was that they were representatives, not delegates. I was not wrong to quote Edmund Burke's letter to the electors of Bristol. I do not know what the hon. Gentleman meant by saying that I was wrong: I do not think that I was.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful that the penny has dropped. The hon. Gentleman gave the Labour party the credit of being representatives rather than delegates. I invite him to study the Register of Members' Interests to see whether that is so. Is he convinced that they are all representatives and not delegates?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I leave it to the hon. Gentleman to clarify his point. I was not wrong in the classical interpretation of Burke's view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting debating point, but I will not go down that road.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This morning I issued an invitation to the hon. Member for Stroud to visit Scotland to discover the opinions there. I hope that he will accept

	<span class='label label-info column'>1473</span>
it. I received a letter at lunchtime that is relevant to the debate. The lady correspondent writes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Scottish people understand perfectly what is being suggested—3 Water Boards set up by the Government to replace the present system of locally-elected members having responsibility for water production and sewerage disposal. We do NOT want that so please do not foist it on us in any shape or form."</p></blockquote>
If the hon. Gentleman would like to meet that lady, he will find her in Newton street, Blairgowrie, in the constituency of the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the hon. Gentleman that understanding and dislike of the Government's plans are not confined to what he might have been told is the socialist republic of Strathclyde, but extend to every area and to every class in Scotland. The hon. Gentleman should come and see.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As far as I am aware, the status quo is not on offer. We should debate the provisions of the Bill. We will soon reach them. My hon. Friends the Ministers will answer all the points, but, first, the hon. Gentleman must come forward with the Labour party's proposals. I have heard precious little of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not surprised that someone living in Newton street has written to the hon. Member for Hamilton because the Labour party has one or two supporters in Tayside, North. It regularly loses its deposit and has no councillors, but has a few supporters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The cost of the referendum is, I understand, £750,000. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Whatever it is, that figure has been mentioned, but the cost may be £500,000. If I paid council tax in the area, had children in a school, and was told that the school's budget was affected and it was short of chalk or books—I do not know if such things have happened, but Labour councillors always blame the Government for them—I would say that £500,000 or £750,000 would have bought a great many books and a great deal of chalk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way and to my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North for saying that the Labour party has some support in Newton street. It is just as well that it has support in that street because, according to an edition last year of 	<i>The Press and Journal</i> of Aberdeen, Labour's Scottish membership has slumped to fewer than 18,000 and some senior Members of Parliament cannot muster 200 paid-up supporters in their areas. Let us be glad for Newton street.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not going into the membership of any political party. That is not in the order of consideration motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All political parties are making a sound judgment. About £1,000 is needed from every adult in Scotland to bring the water and sewerage systems up to date. If a saving is being made by not placing money at the disposal of Labour Members, I would be extremely happy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This argument is about a council in which Labour Members have vested interests. There is nothing wrong
	<span class='label label-info column'>1474</span>
with that, but Conservative Members want to get on with considering the Bill. [HON. MEMBERS: "The hon. Gentleman voted against the Question being put."]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the best points about the Bill is that it will separate the poacher—the provider of services—from the gamekeeper who looks after the public interest. That is good news. My hon. Friends and I will continue to support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that I voted in favour of the debate continuing because I was keen to hear my hon. Friend's words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we can stop at that point, I should be happy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Stroud began his speech by referring to Machiavelli. I commend to him a book by Edward Pearce called "Machiavelli's Children" which outlines dramatically what happens to modern politicians when they embark on subjects of which they know little.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that Conservative Members travel north to see what is happening because they might understand that they are putting in jeopardy the attitude to the Union, as I said this afternoon during business questions. The point was well made this morning by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood). He said that the debate is not only about water, but a great many other things, including the haughty dismissal of people's opinions. It is political dynamite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I heard that a Foreign Office Minister, a Somerset Member of Parliament with whom I have had dealings and respect, had publicly threatened to vote against the Government on the question of Somerset county council. There is a parallel. Before attacking Strathclyde, Conservative Members should examine the problems that they are understandably encountering. There is a problem in Britain generally—in Shropshire, in Norfolk, in Somerset and elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask the Minister, the hon. Member for Dumfries, what he meant by the phrase "on the menu"? This morning, it was argued that somehow or another there had been a sleight of hand, that the question in the referendum was not fairly put by Strathclyde and that privatisation should not be inferred. I do not think that Conservative Members would dispute that that was the argument in general terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not, without great care, go round saying that my parliamentary colleagues are liars. It is true that I have a reputation for having been thrown out of the House of Commons more times than anyone else for saying that, but I remind the Committee that I was referring to a particular Member of Parliament telling a particular lie on a particular occasion for a particular reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall certainly not generalise and include the hon. Member for Dumfries as a liar. But—I address my hon. Friends—the hon. Gentleman must face up to the history of this matter. Before the 1992 election, he was widely quoted as saying that in no circumstances would the Forestry Commission be privatised. He can deny it if he wishes, but that was the impression he gave.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before and after the election. It was in an Adjournment debate, that is correct.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister, on behalf of the Government, give watertight assurances that any suggestion that water will be privatised is wrong? Can he give that solemn assurance on behalf of the Government? If not, what did he mean by the phrase "on the menu"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is being devious. I made it absolutely clear that privatisation is not Government policy as far as Scottish water is concerned. I cannot be any clearer than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that mean that within the foreseeable future and within this Parliament, there is no question of privatising water? Doe we have that assurance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. If the hon. Gentleman listens to what I have to say later he will realise that, in any event, privatisation of water would require further legislation. If he is so depressed about his party's chances of winning the next election, he will realise exactly what that means.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that there is no question of the privatisation of water in Scotland in this Parliament under any circumstances? Is the answer to that yes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to thank the hon. Member for Paisley, South for supplying us with this Strathclyde water. I notice that Opposition Members have not drunk theirs yet. I wanted to watch the reaction of my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud to see how he got on with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the water and I am also pleased to note from 	<i>The Scotsman</i> that Scottish councils are investing more than £25 million of their pension funds in English water companies. Is not that an excellent sign for the future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is an excellent sign and it shows the confidence of Scottish investors. The Scottish financial institutions are, of course renowned for their canniness in investing in successful English water companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the hon. Gentleman enjoy the water, which he got for nothing? Can he guarantee that that water would be available at so reasonable a price when the Government's proposals go ahead? This is a wonderful gesture by Strathclyde water.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can give the hon. Gentleman that assurance. I was hoping that the hon. Gentleman would drink the water first; I was rather
	<span class='label label-info column'>1476</span>
suspicious as it came from Loch Katrine. I have no idea of the quality of that water.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Loch Katrine is in the Central region. The great value of the water system is that local authorities got together to draw up a central Scotland water board area and to use the waters of Loch Katrine for Strathclyde and Central region. I believe that the area extends all the way to the town of Linlithgow from Loch Katrine. It is beautiful, pure water; I have a bit of a cold at the moment and its healing powers are amazing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I look forward to drinking it. I want now to make a more serious point. We have had a long debate on a procedural motion and the Opposition's cant and hypocrisy have been remarkable. The purpose of the debate was to orchestrate a media campaign to reinforce what the Opposition think was a publicity coup in the Strathclyde referendum. That should be said because, once again, a whole chunk of the day has ben wasted in a futile publicity stunt to catch the attention of the media.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not suggesting that I was involved in a publicity stunt. I was asked to accept a motion which I took in good faith. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not criticising the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not criticising the Chair. The motion was tabled and as Chairman, Mr. Martin, you considered it and took a decision. My point is the motivation of those who tabled the procedural motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a number of occasions during our proceedings, Opposition Members have wasted time in Committee to synchronise issues in the Bill with the convenience of the Scottish media. This is the second Tuesday on which that has happened. The first time, we sat here going nowhere, listening to hon. Members such as the hon. Member for Dundee, East, who was most entertaining. He spoke for 21 minutes on the meaning of the phrase "reasonably practicable". The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley took us on a tour of Benwyvis drive to meet Elsie Menzies, simply to delay the Committee's proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman was not awake. Elsie Menzies comes from Cumnock, not from Benwyvis drive. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will get a set of the 	<i>Hansard</i> reports and read them in his spare time. We shall give him a little test later.

The hon. Gentleman talks about wasting time; he had the opportunity just after half-past four to allow us to proceed to a vote and afterwards to discuss the other, non-contentious matters. He did not take that opportunity. If he is really worried about wasting time, why did not he vote with the Opposition? One vote from the hon. Member for Hexham could have made all the difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to put on record what the Opposition have been doing during this debate. They have insulted this Committee by playing to an audience outside the Committee Room. The consequence was that we had another time-wasting session on Tuesday. We crept through some inconsequential amendments which could have been dealt with easily because Opposition Members did not want to get on to the water debate

until this morning, when they thought that the television cameras would be here. It is a pity that the rules of the House did not allow the cameras in so that Opposition Members could make the most of their publicity stunt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman accept that the Opposition are not going to apologise for the ineptitude of your Ministers and the Conservative Whip? We wanted to start on the real issues 55 minutes ago but you—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not have any side in the Committee. The hon. Gentleman must rephrase his intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. Martin. Does not the hon. Gentleman agree that Ministers are prolonging this debate simply because they were ambushed? They are now in a ridiculous position from which they do not have a clue about how to extricate themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I totally reject that. I repeat: the Committee has been turned into an orchestrated plaything by the Opposition, who want to synchronise proceedings for the benefit of the Scottish media. That is deeply hypocritical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to support the procedural motion. I should have been just as happy to follow the discipline evident among Opposition Members and to have proceeded to the amendments, but the Government have decided that we should continue this debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question raised by the motion is whether the Government are prepared to take stock of any consultation exercise. It is not a question of whether the referendum is legally binding, although the hon. Member for Stroud seemed to be worried about whether it was part of our constitution. In large part, the people of the west coast of Scotland and Strathclyde, of all political persuasions, have spoken. How many times must the Scottish people speak out before the Government hear them and table amended clauses that respond to their wishes?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government placed great stock in the original consultation process. It is difficult to get people to focus on how to respond. The Government did not give people in Scotland information on a leaflet that could be posted back. That facility will be extended by the boundary commission in England. Even so, 4,834 individuals and organisations did write back to the Government. I was involved in allowing people to petition on the streets. It was significant that 94 per cent. of those people said that they were against privatisation, but 67 per cent. of that proportion said that they wanted local authority control—the status quo—to remain. A total of 64 per cent. specified a preference for local authorities. That information is contained in the official summary of responses to the consultation paper, in paragraph 2.4 on page 3. We have referred to that document before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no doubt that the Government took some account of those findings. They were going top speed for privatisation, as they have in the case of Wales, but they seemed to respond. However, it is important to dispel the mythology that no one responded to the consultation
	<span class='label label-info column'>1478</span>
apart from Labour voters in Strathclyde. The original summary of responses reported that all regional and island councils opposed privatisation. They all said that they wished water to remain within local authority control. Not all island and regional councils are Labour-controlled. The three island councils recommended that they continued to supply the service as local authorities. Of the 47 responses from district councils, 83 per cent. supported retention of the services under local authority control. Not all of those people live in Strathclyde, or under Labour authorities. So Conservative Members are being disingenuous when they pretend that they represent communities that do not support local authority control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has his view, but Scottish councils voted in another way as well. They invested £25 million from pension funds in private water companies. What clearer sign of their true thinking could there be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that that point is made naively and that the hon. Gentleman will try to learn something about investment programmes and the rules of investment that govern all local authorities—including any that the hon. Gentleman could have served on and the one of which I was a member. Investment is made by investment brokers without regard to the political colour of the council and the wishes of the individuals whose pensions are involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My pension, like that of the hon. Gentleman, is probably held in a Government scheme and not in Lloyd's, where it could be lost overnight. It is in other schemes and I have no control over whether they are profitable. The hon. Gentleman knows that and he was silly and disingenuous to suggest that investment decisions have anything to do with the political colour of a council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend not think it is contradictory for Conservative Members to argue that there is a desperate need for investment in water and sewerage services, yet also argue that people should invest in the private water companies, which take profits away from investment and infrastructure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a good point. I hope that we shall consider it when we deal with the substantive amendments to the Bill. The issue of whether the Government considered other financial solutions is something that we must touch on and explore in detail later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second largest group of responses from non-individuals came from community councils. When we debated them, everyone said how important they were as a balance against local councils and that they had the right to express opinions that should be listened to. Of their responses, the vast majority expressed support for the status quo. That appears in the Government's report on the original consultation. The responses affected the Government and they moved away from the privatisation scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to note that Strathclyde produced 30 per cent. of the responses and it was under-represented in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0819">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1479</span>
terms of its proportion of the population in Scotland. Highland had 6 per cent. of the responses, Lothian 20 per cent., and Grampian 14 per cent. of those we took the trouble to find a way to get back to the Scottish Office with their opinion. Those regions contributed more per capita than the others. The hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside should not pretend that he represents a population that would not vote similarly, in a ballot or referendum, to the people of Strathclyde.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was said that the cost of balloting the opinions of the people of Strathclyde was 37p per elector. That is cheap, for an important act of democracy—a one-off payment of £650,000. The Government's plans for local government reorganisation will cost between £350 million and £700 million. That will be a charge on people of £150 to £350 per annum for the bizarre attempt to break up local authorities in Scotland—the equivalent of £3.50 to £7 a week for every week and for every council tax payer in Scotland. Compared to that, £650,000 for an act of pure democracy, which allowed the people to give their opinion to the Committee through balloting, is cheap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should take the motion on board. They should take the time available to listen to 4,834 respondents and to the 1,194,667 who said that they do not want the Government's quangos and water boards. The question was not about privatisation but clearly about the water boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Prime Minister is involved in a process, which my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton understands better than I do, that may bring about changes in the Government's proposals. Perhaps, they will introduce a motion similar to this in a day or two that says, "Stop now". If the Committee does not mind the metaphor, I hope that the Government will recognise that they should not wade in the water and that it is time that they got out. They should do that now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a sense, the Government side-stepped public opinion when they consulted on the original document. They ignored the logic on finance. The hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside said that we should discuss financing. The submissions to the consultation, including that from Central region, included financing. We need £5 billion for water in Scotland. We shall debate that later, in detail. If the Government continued the same level of capital permission for spending on water and sewerage services—with no increase—that would provide £3 billion. The remaining £2 billion could be raised by a process of capital finance from current revenue, which is currently raised from negotiated leases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many reasons that the Government do not have to move from a local authority based structure to a quango, to get the results that they want—improved water and sewerage services within the present parameters of the public spending round. The Government may intend to draw out that £3 billion. The only way that they can do that is by privatisation, and that logic led people to say what they did in the ballot. I hope that the Government will look seriously at that logic, if they did not look at the submissions before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I gave the example of the Welsh water authority. If the Government pursue their policy, every one seems to think that it will end up like the Welsh water authority. That board was appointed by the Government, just as is proposed for the three Scottish boards. Where is it now? It has gone. Welsh Water now runs the Welsh water
	<span class='label label-info column'>1480</span>
system. What that privatised company has done would make the hairs of even a Lloyd's broker stand on end. It lost £49 million in investments and has written off debt afer debt for projects, other than water, in which it became involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final exercise to take stock was a referendum. The Government should not be so pompous—their Back Benchers are echoing that pomposity—to say that the democratic system of Committees and of the Floor of the House is sufficient. We should not necessarily replace that system with referendums—although I would support greater use of referendums on many issues—but take stock of public opinion. If we do that, we must adjust what we do in this Committee and elsewhere in this place. That is all that we ask.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want the Government to accept the proposal, withdraw the clauses on water, adjust their policies, and come back with something in line not only with public opinion—that is not sufficient if there are massive costs to the public—but with good financial practice and good delivery of service. That good practice and service would be achieved if the Government introduced a proposal more in line with what we propose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is on offer is a chance for the Government to take stock, to show that they are responsive and not to become so irrelevant to Scottish politics that the Conservative party will simply cease to exist after the regional and the European elections this year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the debate because the Government's position is untenable. Their ruling of Scotland with 25 per cent. of the vote has been tenable because there is an English majority. However, I do not think that they can put through a major policy programme that is supported by only two per cent. of the electorate. We are wearing the badges that show 97 per cent.—that is 97 per cent. of those who voted. Only 2 per cent. of those who participated voted for the Government's proposals and 69.4 per cent. of the entire electorate voted against them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the arguments about abstentions and all the rest of it, but still nearly 70 per cent. of people in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0820">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1481</span>
Strathclyde cast their vote against the Government. That seems to me extremely significant and it should be taken into account. The only argument that Conservative Members could come up with was about whether we would want a referendum on hanging. That was fairly weak, since, to the best of my knowledge, hanging is not yet a local government responsibility. Nowhere in the Bill is it suggested that it should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument that the referendum did not give alternatives suggests that Conservative Members would have liked a referendum with policy-making powers. That, as I understand it, is the difference between the proposed European Community referendum and the Strathclyde referendum. The latter was a question of whether to express support for the Government's proposal. Perhaps I may read out the question that was put. It read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Do you agree with the Government's proposal for the future of water and sewerage services?"</p></blockquote>
It required the answer yes or no. That is an indicative referendum. People were given an opportunity to state whether they were in favour, not to register whether they favoured another option. I should be quite happy with a multichoice referendum, not only on the future of Scotland's water but on the future of its Government. We should consider such a worthwhile undertaking. I hope that the Government will take that idea on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that the Government can fall back only on the argument that people did not understand or were misled suggests a certain moral and political bankruptcy. I could have understood that argument had they lost by 1 per cent. or 2 per cent., or even by 3 per cent. or 4 per cent. To lose by the difference between 2 per cent. and 69.4 per cent. of the electorate, however, suggests that people knew what they were voting for and concluded decisively that they were hostile to the Government's proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was suggested earlier that the issue is a constitutional one. That is true—it is becoming such an issue. I should tell English Tory Members that if you are intent on using your votes to drive through the Committee a policy that commands the support of 2 per cent. of the Strathclyde electorate, you are playing fast and loose—to use the phrase that was employed earlier—with the constitution. The policy that you are putting forward is supported by 2 per cent. of the Strathclyde electorate. Even if the supporters doubled, that would still only make 4 per cent. Like all my hon. Friends—and like all of you, I am sure—I should like to double the vote that I received in the previous election, but what would have been the effect of a doubling of your party's votes in the referendum?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If I may help the hon. Gentleman, he should refrain from using the word "you".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that you, Mr. Martin, obtained more than 50 per cent. of the vote in your constituency, so that it would be difficult for your vote to be doubled. For somebody like me, however, who received only 49 per cent. of the vote, doubling of that would bring it into line with the percentage that has been obtained in the referendum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question now is how far the Government will retreat. They have no alternative but to change their proposals. Labour Members understand that there are
	<span class='label label-info column'>1482</span>
already straws in the wind. There will be several retreats. Questions such as whether councillors should be admitted to the new boards and whether they should be elected by the authorities or selected by the Secretary of State are issues about which the Government will, I think, be flexible. However, two of the issues that they face require full consideration, not the making of ad hoc changes. The first concerns the political changes that are necessary to save what can be save of the Government's bacon. The second relates to how those can be translated into practice so that the Bill is coherent. Those questions deserve consideration by the Government and a full internal examination to ensure that they are logically consistent. There will be political pressure to make changes, but we in Scotland want a system that will work not a slipshod, rushed Bill to save your bacon in the short term which cannot be operated in the long term. [HON. MEMBERS: "Their bacon."] Sorry, Mr. Martin. Their bacon.

The results are interesting. I mentioned that 69.4 per cent. of the electorate voted no in the referendum. In my constituency of Govan, 75.4 per cent. of the electorate voted no. I admit that I was astonished by the result. I was aware that the overwhelming majority in my constituency was hostile to the Government's view, but did not anticipate that such a high percentage of people would take the trouble to fill in ballot papers and post them to Strathclyde region. Only 1 per cent. of the electorate in my constituency voted for the Government's proposal. It may be thought that that is not unusual because Govan is not a constituency well know for its number of Government supporters. However, the Conservatives held local authority seats there some time ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth examining the results from constituencies held by members of the Government. In Eastwood, only 3.3 per cent. of the electorate took the trouble to vote yes. In Ayr, only 4.4 per cent. of the electorate voted yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we accept the argument used by the Secretary of State on "Newsnight", we should carefully examine the people who did not vote. We would discover that in some Tory constituencies the turnout was higher than the average in other areas. A false argument has been put forward. Conservative voters were told to keep ballot papers in their pockets. The Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Eastwood told us that he told Conservative voters tokeep their ballot papers in their pockets, presumably as a souvenir of the humiliation, and not to return them, even in the Government interest. Even on that basic advice the Government failed dismally because the electors in Eastwood were sufficiently motivated to reject the Government's policy and not go along the lines recommended by their Member of Parliament, who happened to be one of the architects of this foolish venture.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an extremely valuable point. In the constituency of the Minister, the hon. Member for Eastwood, 3.3 per cent. of the electorate voted for the Government's policy and 65.2 per cent. voted against. Presumably the remainder are a combination of those who followed his advice to abstain, those who have died and those who were absent or unable to vote. Roughly two thirds of the electorate in the Minister's constituency took the action of voting against his advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend had the opportunity to read the System 3 Scotland poll, which was carried out on 11 November 1993? It put a similar question, so perhaps we should be surprised at the turnout, but not the result. That poll showed that 95 per cent. thought that water and sewerage services should be left as they are. Will my hon. Friend comment on the astonishing rinding that 83 per cent. of Conservative voters preferred the status quo and only 13 per cent. wanted new water authorities? Does not that show that the Government do not even have the support of their voters? Their supporters are overwhelmingly against the proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a useful point. It cannot be argued from the figures that the largest percentage in Conservative seats voted yes or abstained. The percentage of people who voted against the Government's proposal in Ayr, 63.1 per cent., is higher than the percentage of people who voted against in the Labour constituency of Cunninghame, South, at 54.6 per cent. In some Conservative constituencies, more people voted no than in some Labour constituencies. That shows the enormous strength of feeling throughout Strathclyde. In seven parliamentary constituencies, less than 1 per cent. of the electorate voted for the Government scheme. That is well within the realms of error, which we shall always get. When given a choice between yes and no, several people will make a mistake simply by random sampling. It would not be unreasonable to claim that the 1 per cent. had voted yes in error, if it were not for the fact that some Conservative party members ignored the Minister's advice and voted in the referendum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the themes developed by Conservative Members, especially those who do not represent constituencies in Strathclyde, is that their part of Scotland is different, and that a different result would have occurred in other places. My hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley referred to the System 3 opinion poll, which covered the whole of Scotland. It covered the three water board areas, and included Grampian, Tayside, and Lothian in the east of Scotland. The poll showed that 69 per cent. of Conservative supporters wanted a national referendum on the Government proposals. Does my hon. Friend believe that Conservative supporters in Scotland will be disappointed by the attitude of their representatives in Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East made a valuable point about different parts of the country. When we discussed Helensburgh and the authority to which it should belong, Conservative Members argued that Argyll and Bute had different characteristics from Dumbarton, and that Helensburgh should be with Argyll and Bute, which was more in line with Helensburgh than Dumbarton. Conservative Members said that there was a substantial difference between Argyll and Bute and Dumbarton. Yet 69.3 per cent. voted no in Argyll and Bute. In Dumbarton, 69.3 per cent. voted no. In two areas that the Government claimed were vastly different, the same percentage voted against the Government's proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In the area that I described, 88 per cent., excluding the don't knows, do not agree with the Government's proposals for the future of the water industry. Does not my hon. Friend think that that is conclusive evidence of the fact that the result in Strathclyde has been repeated in every other part of Scotland? There is a nationwide condemnation of this absolute folly and a clear view that another set of proposals for Scotland's water is needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is absolutely clear that throughout Strathclyde—an area that varies widely in its political make-up and geographical situation—there is a remarkable consistency in the yes and no percentages; the vote was overwhelmingly against the proposition. That is reflected thoughout Scotland and if any Conservative Member disputes that, I ask what steps he would take to identify public opinion in the other areas. I badly misjudged the opinion of my constituents. I believed that they were against the Government's proposals but I never dreamt that such a high percentage would vote against them. The Government have an obligation to reconsider their scheme. The referendum, and this debate, allow us to argue that they must produce alternatives. There would be nothing worse than going into this debate, with the Government gradually removing the veils hiding their new policy and that policy emerging on the hoof, piece by piece. We must examine the coherence of the Government's policy and it must therefore be published before we discuss it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear from my hon. Friend's comments that Conservative Members are not moved by geography.

water and sewerage services. Does not my hon.

Is not that significant?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that Conservative Members, especially those who do not represent Scottish constituencies, are made aware that opposition to the Government's proposal is not confirmed to the ranks of supporters of Opposition parties.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises a central point in our debate.

I have heard from Conservative Members that the electorate in Strathclyde did not understand what was being discussed, that it was the fault of the press in Strathclyde which misled them and that the information provided by the Labour party and the Scottish Trades Union Congress was misleading. But I do not believe that Strathclyde could have got such a result by deception alone. After all, this is the Government who were elected at the previous general election, largely because of their commitment to cut taxes. They subsequently turned round and raised them and are continuing to raise them. The Government are expert in doing U turns.

In the circumstances, the Government must take account of the overwhelming view of the people of Strathclyde. There must be amendments to the Bill. It is far better that they are produced coherently as a package so that we can consider them fully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to return to the earlier point about the future of the Union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has just made a strong point. I have asked Ministers and Conservative Members
	<span class='label label-info column'>1486</span>
the following question, but have received no answer. With my hon. Friend's experience and understanding, perhaps he could give me an answer. What difference will it make to the Government if those matters are discussed in April rather than in March? Surely it will make no difference to the Committee what order we take the amendments. We can discuss them just as well in the Committee after the Easter recess as we can rushing through them now. Can my hon. Friend think of any reason for not changing the order? We are simply discussing the order in which we discuss the clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can see a very strong reason, from the Government's point of view, why they should not be prepared to change their mind in any way. I worry that they think that any concession or sign of willingness to listen will be seen as a sign of weakness. Any concession made to the overwhelming view of the Scottish people would be an acknowledgement of their own lack of legitimacy, which would inevitably lead to the abandonment of their overall policy. I think that that is the Government's view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that my hon. Friend was chairman of an education committee, as was I, and he has had a lot of experience in local government. Does he agree that the general perception in local government and amongst the public will be that if the Government take account of the referendum, that would be a sign not of weakness, but of strength and sense? We are probably doing ourselves a bit of political harm by suggesting that, but would not it be politically sensible for the Government to take account of the referendum? It would not be a sign of weakness; it would be a sign of strength and maturity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is correct. I find myself in two minds. From a narrow political party point of view, I hope that the Government refuse to bend at all and carry on with their existing policy. I hope that they refuse to listen and continue hell-bent down that route. That can only maximise the support that we attract, not only in the regional elections, but in the European elections. We shall try to turn the regional and European elections into the next referendum on the question of the water industry and related issues. If the result of 97 per cent. against the Government's proposals is reflected in the local authority election results, there will be very few Conservatives left to represent Scottish seats.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Member give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley has opened up an interesting vista. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Govan will ponder over the reason why the Government will not wait a month to discuss part II after part IV. I can reveal that in the System 3 opinion poll we have dealt with the geography and the politics, but the group that is least opposed to the Government is in the 25 to 34 age group: in that age group only 77 per cent. are aginst the Government's proposals. When we study the 65 plus age group, 85 per cent. are against. As one gets older, one stiffens one's resolve to oppose the Government. Obviously the Government are playing for time in hoping
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0823">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1487</span>
that the young voters do not get older and, as a consequence, add to the growing ranks of people who think that the system is crazy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting point, and one that I had not considered. However, I should have thought that the prospect of our debating this matter until the 20 to 25 age group become the majority of the population is fairly slim. I was about to give way to the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie), but he seems, sensibly, to have given up. Any man who gets 4.4 per cent. of the electorate in his constituency voting for his party's policy and 63.1 per cent. voting against it cannot legitimately have a great deal to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree with my guess that a large proportion of that 4.4 per cent. are in Alloway and Doonfoot, which the boundary commission is about to move out of the constituency of the hon. Member for Ayr? Earlier, the hon. Gentleman said that he does not need a lifebelt. He is right: he needs a whole liner to save him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is in an extremely difficult position. The number of people in Ayr who voted for the proposals was 2,925. In Tuesday's debate, it emerged that the number of members of the Ayr Conservative association was 1,445. That indicates that each Conservative was able to attract one friend to vote that way. But on the same principle, that party membership equals half of the vote on either side, the Labour, Liberal and Scottish National party membership in Ayr would be about 20,765. I am not aware that a selection conference is going on in Ayr. I have some expertise in matters of recruitment, and the figures show that the Government have relatively little support in that area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend mentioned selection conferences. He knows that we have some problems in our party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Committee must allow the Chairman to have some slippage, but selection conferences have nothing to do with the order of consideration motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going to move to another subject, Mr. Martin. I wonder whether my hon. Friend noticed that, just before he dismissed the Strathclyde referendum with such contempt as not particularly relevant, the Prime Minister had been banging the Dispatch Box in defence of British democracy inside the European Union? Why are the Conservatives prepared to defend British democracy inside the European Union, but not Scottish democracy in the British Union?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As far as I can see, the Government take the view, as expressed by the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson), that the attention that they pay to any referendum or similar exercise depends on the result. That at least has the value of honesty. The point about the present debate about blocking minorities and national vetos is interesting. To take one constituency at random, in Glasgow, Springburn, 0.8 per cent. of that electorate voted for the Government's proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1488</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is best not to involve the Chair in the debate. The hon. Gentleman should pick another constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I mentioned it in the context of the birthplace of the hon. Member for Dundee, East, but in Glasgow, Govan 0.8 per cent. of the electorate voted for the policy that the Government intend to push through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can it be right that 0.8 per cent. of the electorate in one constituency—and the figure is reflected throughout the area—can have their wish met that the Government's proposals, spelt out over a long period, should be put into legislation when the views of 64.6 per cent. of the electorate in the same constituency can be totally ignored?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate has focused largely on the urban areas of Strathclyde and why the people there were worried enough to vote in the way that they did. If my hon. Friend considers the table, he will see that in Argyll and Bute 73.1 percent, of the people voted. Of them, 94.8 per cent. voted no. A major consideration for people in that area is access to lochs, reservoirs and the countryside. They want the water industry to remain in public ownership not only so that they can enjoy those facilities, but because they know the value of tourism to the local economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a valuable point. As I said, 69.3 per cent. of the electorate in Argyll and Bute voted against the Government's proposals. It is important that we use the percentage of the electorate that voted no because abstensions could be taken to be Government supporters who followed the line of Ministers that they should not participate in the vote and should burn or destroy the ballot paper to invalidate it. However, in Argyll and Bute 69.3 per cent. of the electorate firmly rejected the Government's proposals. We must take into account the issue of legitimacy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend considered the Government's consultation process, which received a total of 4,834 responses? What we thought was a massive turnout of 90,000 individual signatures and petitions and of the 60,000 pre-printed postcards that were added to them comes to 150,000 responses only. They were enough to shift the Government from their original intention, which was to move quickly to privatisation and to the quangos and joint and boards. On the scale of legitimacy, the referendum—a vox pop response to the Government's proposals from 1.2 million people—is obviously much more significant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. There can be no doubt that the Government began with the idea of privatising Scotland's water. I heard the Minister tell my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) that that is not the Government's proposal at the moment and I accept that that is so in the short term. I do not believe the Minister if he suggests that it is not the Government's intention at a future stage to privatise Scotland's water. The logic of the Government's proposals is to sell off every possible national asset. It is their legitimate belief that such services are best run in the private sector. We should be grateful to the hon. Member for Tayside, North for spelling that out so clearly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0824">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1489</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that I tried as hard as possible to tie down the Minister to giving a categorical assurance about the Government's intentions? [HON. MEMBERS: "The hon. Gentleman got it."] I got it from him, but it was not clear whether he was speaking on behalf of more senior Ministers and his colleagues in the rest of the Government. I want it made clear that the assurance came from the Government as a whole and was not just the honest opinion of the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a bit hard of an old colleague such as the hon. Gentleman to hammer on trying to imply that what I said was not my view and that of the Government. My view is that of the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following that intervention, I have no doubt that the Minister has expressed unequivocally the policy of the Government at 6.15 pm on Thursday 24 March. I have no confidence, however, that that will remain the Government's policy at 7.15 pm or 8.15 pm or on any subsequent date. The logic of the Government's policy, as followed through consistently, is to privatise Scotland's water and to introduce disconnections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the motion, which would delay the consideration of part II until after part IV, reflects the fact that the people of Strathclyde are very concerned about what has happened in England and Wales. Is my hon. Friend aware that in the past five years the English water companies made pre-tax profits of £5.7 billion? Does he agree that that seems to be a very substantial profit? What does he think might have happened to it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that it has been siphoned off to the money men who put money into the water companies and to other ventures. People in Strathclyde are aware of what has happened in the English and Welsh water companies. That, I believe, is why there was such an overwhelming vote to reject the Government's proposals. Those people are aware that a clear consequence of the Government's scheme would be the establishment of privately-funded water boards, which they and I believe would in due course be completely privatised. That is why they want to stop the process at the first opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says that the voters of Strathclyde were very aware of the experience, in England and Wales, of privatised water companies. I draw his attention to early-day motion 911 which appears in today's Order Paper and which compares the charge made by private water companies in Wales, which is currently £233 per household, with that made by public water authorities in Scotland, which is on average £116—half of the charge under privatised water arrangements. Does not that show the advantage of keeping water under public control by democratically-elected local authorities which ensure that prices are kept at a reasonable and affordable level, and do not allow privatised water companies to rip people off?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The level of pricing by water companies in England and Wales was among the issues that people in Strathclyde debated before they cast their votes in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1490</span>
referendum. An assumption has been made, particularly by some of the English Tory Members, that people in Strathclyde know little or nothing about the English and Welsh experience. That is not so. The issues of disconnections, of increases in charges, and of the siphoning off of money to private profit and into other ventures are widely discussed in Strathclyde and throughout Scotland. Some English Tory Members seem to assume that the people of Strathclyde have been led by the nose by the Labour party or by the press into voting against Government policy. In fact they understand full well what has happended to water in England and Wales and they are bitterly opposed to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that my hon. Friend is addressing his remarks to the motion, because we want the Government to delay deliberations on part II so that they can consider the implications of events in Wales. Does my hon. Friend agree that in the first four years of the privatised water system 54,000 families had their water supply disconnected? What kind of barbarity is that? Does my hon. Friend agree that that alone should persuade the Government to delay consideration of part II and to consider current Scottish law? Can we trust, in the matter of disconnection, a Government who treat with such arrogance 1.2 million people who have said no to their crazy proposals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the earlier point about water charges, the question of disconnections was one of those that led such an overwhelming percentage of Strathclyde's population to vote to reject the Government's proposals. Strathclyde people are aware of what has been happening in England and Wales. In my constituency a series of meetings—street meetings, public meetings and discussions at community council—have been held, at which disconnection has been discussed. Stories that are regarded as "Little Shop of Horrors" stories are widespread in the area. People know stories of disconnections of water in blocks of flats, which have led to human waste being thrown out of windows, dumped down rubbish chutes, or left on landings, with consequent health hazards. Reports from public health authorities in England—particularly in some of the cities—have been circulated around parts of my constituency. People have read them and want to make sure that nothing similar happens in their area, so they came out in substantial numbers to cast votes against the Government's proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend on having begun now to concentrate on the subject of sewerage. Many people, including us, to be honest, have been concentrating on water and have forgetten that the Bill also deals with sewage disposal. That is vital to public health. I remember my mother telling me some time ago—she was very active in—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In sewage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, not sewage. It is me who is from time to time up to the oxters in sewage without a paddle. My mother was involved in public health and she used to say to me that the best provisions for public health are a pure water supply and a decent sewerage system. Britain was way ahead of some other European countries. It is vital,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0825">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1491</span>
therefore, that we maintain that tradition in the public sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is valuable to have that account of the views of my hon Friend's mother on this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: She voted no, by the way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not surprised to hear that. Many people discussed the future of sewerage services before determining how they would vote in the referendum. Conservative Members frequently treat such issues with contempt and find them humorous. Their humour is entirely misplaced. They completely misunderstand the strength and depth of feeling about these matters in Scotland in general and in Strathclyde in particular, especially in my constituency. Are they aware that the number of disconnections in England and Wales has increased and that many impoverished families have had their water cut off?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important point. We would have preferred to debate these matters at the end of our proceedings, which would have been the appropirate time. If the closure motion had been carried, it would have allowed the Government time to consider my hon. Friends' arguments, which have been put to them regularly and consistently since the consultative document was issued. Is not it amazing that my hon. Friend has been forced to make these points now because the Government voted against against the closure motion that we proposed earlier?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rubbish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister makes a sedentary intervention. The fact is that when the Opposition moved the closure of the debate to allow progress to be made, Conservative Members voted against it. We are now obliged to continue with this debate and make these points prematurely because the Government chose deliberately to vote against the closure motion proposed by the Opposition. That is amazing and contrasts with what the Minister implied in his sedentary intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my hon. Friend made that important point, and I am also glad that the Minister wants to intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of what the hon. Member for Hamilton has just said, I should make our position absolutely clear. Two of my hon. Friends wished to contribute to the debate. They have done so. We do not object to the hon. Gentleman doing so as well, but the Committee should not think that we are not looking forward to the time when he will sit down and be quiet so that the Chairman can put the Question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. At 4.30 I moved that the Question be now put. I did not have an opportunity to speak this morning. To help the Committee and to make progress, I decided to move the closure motion. I had to forgo my opportunity to speak. However, the two hon. Gentlemen who have spoken have sparked off many ideas and put many questions in my head. I would like to ask those questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1492</span>
Is the Minister telling us that he voted against the closure motion and advised his hon. Friends to do the same because two Conservative Members wanted to speak? Will you confirm, Mr. Martin, that that is grossly unfair because they have sparked off a further debate among Labour Members?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Those matters have nothing to do with the order of consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may return to the point about disconnections, how that influenced the referendum and why the Government should reconsider the case that they want to put before us. There is much knowledge in my constituency and throughout Strathclyde about the patterns of disconnections in England and Wales. There is also much knowledge, as well as fear and anxiety, about the possible introduction of self-disconnection mechanisms—precharging systems—that would allow the poorest people to cut off their water services in many ways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister argued that the Government do not propose to introduce disconnections to Scotland. I was present in the House when, a few weeks ago, the hon. Member for Stroud argued that water companies could not operate efficiently unless they had the sanction of disconnections. If that is the view in England and Wales, how can the Government argue that they do not intend to introduce disconnections to the other part of the United Kingdom—Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valuable point. Although the vast majority of my constituents and of the people of Strathclyde may not have heard of Stroud or of the hon. Member who represents it, they are aware that there is a widespread desire among Conservative Members to introduce in Scotland systems of compulsory water cut-off, to help make the systems financially sound. When hon. Members such as the hon. Member for Tayside, North, say that they want to privatise the system, the assumption is that those ideas are only being held back temporarily and that this is the first stage. The stages to follow will include privatisation and compulsory cut-off.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Scottish Office taken the trouble to get evidence from Sheffield and Bradford about cut-offs? It is devastating. I do not doubt that the chief medical officer, Professor Kendall—if I may name him—is an intelligent man, but I wonder whether the Scottish Office has taken into account the devastating evidence of disease in certain communities in English cities, which is a disgrace to Britain in the 1990s.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises a valuable issue. The increase in disease in some English cities and elsewhere as a result of water disconnection is widely known in Strathclyde. That is one factor that led people to vote overwhelmingly against the Government's proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow mentioned Sheffield, which is in Yorkshire. In 1991–92 there were 2,384 disconnections in the Yorkshire area. We tabled the motion to consider part II after part
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0826">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1493</span>
IV because we are worried about how the Tory placemen and placewomen on the three superquangos can be accountable to the people whom we represent, who are terrified of disconnections. The subtext is that water privatisation will surely follow, as day follows night if, for any remote reason, the Government win the next election. How can we hand over such a valuable service to people who are not representative of the local communities that at present discharge their responsibilities very seriously?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is noticeable that the percentage of disconnected consumers in England and Wales is probably about the same as that which voted in favour of the Government's proposals. While the Government are clearly not interested in the minority of people whose services are disconnected, they are prepared to go along with the minority in favour of their scheme. The people of Strathclyde are not worried just about the prospects of their being disconnected. There is a much more communal society in Scotland than in parts of England and Wales, so they are worried also about the prospects of friends and neighbours being disconnected. Those anxieties are widespread.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the point of my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow and to ensure that those anxieties are eased, I hope that when we get to the point in the debate when it is appropriate to discuss disconnections, the Government will give assurances and guarantees that there will be no disconnections in Scotland under any new scheme of water control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend, and I have no doubt that Conservative Members are, too. My hon. Friend gave them the opportunity to consider their stance on the Bill and their view on our amendments. I hate to say this, because it might be damaging to my hon. Friend in his reselection battle, but he is doing precisely what the Government Whips wanted when, to our great surprise, they chose to vote against the closure of the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend made valid, interesting and detailed points. Conservative Members will undoubtedly raise them when we adjourn for dinner in their consultations with the Whips Office, perhaps with the Prime Minister and certainly with the Secretary of State—should they bump into him in a Corridor or on a barge on the Thames. I know that the Secretary of State will want to hear those points. Of course, the right hon. Gentleman may still be talking on the phone to Conservative councillors who are meeting in Dunblane. That may explain why the Government—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman's intervention is far too long. Mr. Davidson.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may have been a trifle long, but my hon. Friend raised valuable points that I want to pick up. There has been an assumption on the part of Conservative Members that people who said no in the referendum were all mad, sad or bad—that they did not understand what they were doing, that they had been misled by the press and misled by the Labour party. In reality, they know fine the real dangers posed by these Government proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1494</span>
I suppose that I have been acting against my narrow party interest in the sense of seeking to make sure that the Government are aware of the very real anxieties felt in Scotland. We have a responsibility, as elected representatives, to make sure that those who are responsible for bringing forward proposals take into account and understand public opinion in a way that they are obviously not doing at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The thrust of the motion is to encompass all the key issues that would be involved in delaying debate of part II until after part IV. Does my hon. Friend agree that another reason why voters in Strathclyde overwhelmingly rejected the crazy proposals for water and sewerage was the number of executive share options held by the 10 water authorities in England and Wales? There were 14 million executive share options on 31 March 1993, worth £79 million in the market place. Would the people of Strathclyde—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. My remarks were directed at the Committee as a whole, not just the hon. Member for Fife, Central.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the anxieties of people in Scotland in general and Strathclyde in particular is that the Government's scheme will result in a lot of money being siphoned off to those who do not deserve to receive it. I presume that it is in that context that the question of executive share options has been so widely debated in the pubs and clubs of my constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend made a tremendous speech. He said earlier that he was not pursuing his own narrow party political interests, and we would like to see Conservative Members imitate that.

referendum I wrote to him. I gave the letter in yesterday and received an acknowledgement this morning. The text of the letter dealt with the very business that my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton was referring to: what did the Prime Minister think was wrong with the question sheet and would he like to suggest a different format? I could find nothing biased in it. I presume that the Prime Minister is thinking seriously about the matter. Is not it important that the motion is carried so that the right hon. Gentleman can form his thoughts after reading the letter and the letter from the Strathclyde water convenor? The Government's decisions about how to proceed might be influenced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Prime Minister was extremely badly advised in his response, as were Government Ministers in their initial response, to the result of the referendum. They seemed to dismiss in an offhand and cavalier fashion the democratically expressed view of more than 1 million Scots. There might be a suggestion of one or two people being misled and the press being biased, but that cannot explain the overwhelming majority against the proposals. The Prime Minister and his hon. Friends should take account of the strength of feeling in Strathclyde.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Chairman asked us to discuss new subjects. I am curious to know what is being said in the pubs and clubs of Govan about the public sector borrowing requirement. The main reason given by the Government for restructuring the water industry in Scotland is that substantial additional investment is required to comply with European Community directives.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Would I be in order if I said that the motion that has just been defeated originated in a request from me to the Clerks Department? I asked them how could we rearrange the Committee's business, if that was what we wanted to do. As always, I was received courteously by the Clerks Department. I was told the form of words required for a motion such as I described. The Clerks' expertise is available to all hon. Members, and they gave me the information that I needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At an early hour this morning I telephoned the Clerk to this Committee, who luckily was in as early as I. I told him that I had sought advice and wished to move the motion this morning. I hoped that the Clerk would bring the matter to your attention, Mr. Martin. I make the position clear because of the noises that I have heard outside the Committee about the way in which the motion was put before the Committee. I offer the information for the wider knowledge of hon. Members. I express my gratitude to the Clerks Department for its guidance through the difficult and complicated procedures involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The matter was put before me this morning in a proper manner. The advice received by the hon. Gentleman is none of my business. Any hon. Member is entitled to seek advice from any Clerk of the House. Whether they take that advice is another matter. Procedurally, everything that was done between 10.30 am and now was perfectly in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support what you have said, Mr. Martin. I am amazed that the hon. Member for Hamilton felt it necessary to say what he did. I accepted the motion and that it was in order. I welcomed the debate even thought I disgareed with its purport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. It is important, after the remarks that have just been made, that all hon. Members should put on record their gratitude to the Clerks. I saw the Clerk about another matter and received only courtesy and help. That has been my experience over all the years that I have been a Member of Parliament. The Committee has been conducted properly and in a manner that befits a Committee of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, we have excellent Clerks, and this Committee has an excellent Clerk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. Even though I have been put down from time to time, this Committee has an excellent Chairman, who has conducted today's proceedings extremely well. I should also add that the Opposition Whip was one of the key people who efficiently and effectively steered us through a useful day. He should be given some credit, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Now that we know that everyone likes the Chairman and the Clerk, perhaps we could move on to clause 61.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Just before we had the vote I was asked for the opinion of the people of Govan on the PSBR.

	<p>	<i>Clause stand part.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Now you know why I was being nice to you earlier. Like you, I am mystified about why we are taking so many amendments together. I thought that amendments were taken together when they referred to similar issues. Although these amendments relate to each other, they cover a range of issues and I am not sure whether we can deal properly with each of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There have been occasions when we have been discussing single amendments and hon. Members have debated clause stand part. The hon. Member should trust me that there are good reasons for grouping all the amendments together, but I cannot go into them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. What is the precedent? I cannot recollect clause stand part being debated with amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman checks the record, he will see that it has been done in other Committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. As you know, the hon. Member for Tayside, North moved that the debate should come to an end. Is it in order for him to do so and then to disappear from this Room to attend another engagement, or should he treat the Committee with the respect that it deserves and stay here until it adjourns?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has always treated the Committee with respect. I have no control over when people come and go from the Committee. It is in order to leave the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Following the point of order made by the hon. Member for Linlithgow, could you explain to me, as someone who is still a novice in Committee matters, how we can debate a clause stand part when we do not know which amendments will be carried or defeated and we do not know the nature of the clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At this stage, only one amendment is being moved. The others are grouped with it so that we can have a debate. We are debating the other amendments and the clause stand part, but only amendment No. 553 is being moved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What we have just witnessed was remarkable. The hon. Member for Tayside, North moved a closure motion on the previous debate on a procedural motion that then had to be put forthwith to the Committee. The procedural motion, which the hon. Gentleman voted against, states that we must debate water at this point. The hon. Gentleman voted with the majority of the Committee to tell the rest of us that we must discuss water now outwith the sequence of what
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0831">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1503</span>
would be normal and logical, given that the Government must bear in mind what happens in Committee. People outside, including the hon. Gentleman's constituents, will wonder about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not say that in a petty sense; I have been absent from the Committee. Two weeks ago I missed part of the evening session to go to the Scottish Labour party conference in Dundee. That is part of the normal cut and thrust of politics. The rest of the Labour Members of the Committee stayed here, and I understand that repeated and regular references were made to my absence by Conservative Members of the Committee, including a Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not including a Minister, it was only the Minister. The hon. Member for Eastwood commented on my hon. Friend's absence again and again. He was not laughing. He got really agitated and carried away and he was twitching and shaking. It was quite a sight; my hon. Friend should have been here to see it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have seen the Minister twitching and shaking before and I have no doubt that he will do so again. If I had to defend this ratbag of a Bill I would be twitching and shaking most of the time. If I had just seen my constituents reject, by a majority of 20:1 what we are about to debate, twitching would be the least of my problems. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Gentleman should go to Buckingham palace immediately. I do not know whether it would be a better place to go to than the Earl Grey hotel in Dundee, but we will not be allowed a vote on that. Going to Dundee is always a pleasure—a much greater pleasure than going to Buckingham palace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not be diverted by the absence of the hon. Member for Tayside, North who precipitated us into this debate and then abandoned it prematurely. I shall deal with the issues before the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate is taking place later than was scheduled but earlier than common sense and logic would suggest, given the new circumstances this week. The matter is of enormous and vital importance to the people of Scotland. We know that, because of the strength of feeling on the issue throughout Scotland and because of its implications, which go well beyond the words in the amendment. The hon. Member for Dumfries said that he welcomed this interesting debate. Perhaps it is my naivety, even at this stage in my political career, but I find it incredible that the Government can be so contemptuous of public opinion in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I read with astonishment the supplement on Scotland last Friday in the 	<i>Financial Times,</i> especially the interview by Mr. James Buxton, the 	<i>Financial Times</i> correspondent, with the Secretary of State for Scotland. I found it difficult to recognise Scotland and the Committee from the account in what is usually a highly reputable newspaper. However, certain points should be drawn to the Committee's attention. Mr. Buxton's article states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Mr. Lang told the 	<i>Financial Times</i> that difficulties in popularity in Scotland related to the United Kingdom political situation and that the Tories no longer faced, 'hostility of the deep-rooted and very focused kind that we experienced at the last election'.".</p></blockquote>
What sort of bizarre world does the Secretary of State for Scotland inhabit? As my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central said, it brings back the words of the Prime Minister about the men in white coats. I know that he
	<span class='label label-info column'>1504</span>
was referring to people such as the hon. Member for Stroud, who may have temporarily forgiven him. If the Secretary of State has been capable in the past fortnight of telling the 	<i>Financial Times</i> or anyone else that sort of gibberish, I wonder at the right hon. Gentleman's judgment, perhaps even his sanity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reality, which we have explored in considerable detail, is that public opinion across the board is against what the Government are doing. Informed public opinion has examined carefully the twists and turns in the Government's position and harshly judged the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government entered consultations; they are reputedly good at consulting. They have conducted eight consultations on housing issues, but consultation has a different dictionary meaning to the Conservative party in Scotland than to practically everyone else in the country. It means that the Government put out a glossy brochure that is well heralded, which gives a tight time scale. They then ignore the views of the people who make their feelings known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So it was with the 10-week consultation that took place on the glossy brochure "Water and Sewerage in Scotland. Investing For Our Future". The Government's publication, which itemised the outcome of the consultation, stated in paragraph 2.4 that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Sixty-four per cent. of all respondents, and 67 per cent. of those opposing privatisation, preferred a solution which kept the services in local authority control, with broadly a quarter of these mentioning a need for direct democratic control of the services."</p></blockquote>
That was at an early stage, before suspicions grew and people knew what the Government were about. The 10-week consultation gave voice to the warnings about what the Government were embarking on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If public opinion and consultation about a major change to a fundamental public service in a democracy was ever going to matter, the Government would not be pursuing such a policy. That is the message from the Committee and from Scotland; it is loud, clear and explicit. Ministers will ignore it at their peril.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be two more referendums this year, which will be better than that which Strathclyde was able to organise—it had to organise it—and better than Sir John Banham's house-by-house consultation in the areas of England that will be given the right of consultation. Those referendums will involve ballot boxes in every neighbourhood of every part of Scotland. Conservative Members will be able to run and run, but they will not be able to hide. On 5 May and 9 June, the people will give their verdict on the Government and on their proposals through the ballot box.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did my hon. Friend see the full-page colour advert in the Sunday papers in which the Secretary of State advertised for candidates to stand in the elections? Is not it astonishing that the Conservatives cannot manage to rustle up enough candidates? That shows the state of the once great Conservative party in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does. The only thing that was missing was the 0898 number. The market economy could have been brought in. It seems staggering. People will want to remain anonymous. Ticks could be put in boxes to state whether a person would send £100, £50, £20 or £10. If an infra-red ray were passed over the advertisement, would boxes be revealed for £5,000 or £10,000 and what people
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0832">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

would receive. I cannot believe that it would be a seat in local government. There will be some important posts around.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would be going too far. The water boards—quangos—will handle substantial sums of money. The people of Scotland know only too well the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1506</span>
way in which such quangos have been routinely stuffed during the years in which the Conservatives have been in power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
