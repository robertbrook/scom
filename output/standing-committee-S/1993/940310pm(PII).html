	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Local Government etc. (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>9 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming—</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we broke for dinner, I was giving the example of Archerfield in my constituency where the presence of a powerful, effective, independent strategic planning authority has been able to protect the community and the landscape. The prospective developer had persuaded the local planning authority, the district council, that it was a price worth paying to give it planning consent for 500 houses in the area so that it would spend the necessary money on redeveloping the old building, associated golf course, the hotel and other leisure facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local planning authority was, understandably, quite rightly, keen on that redevelopment and on such input into the local economy. It did not want to concede to the housing, but it thought that that was the price that it would have to pay. That would have been the end of the story had there been only a single-tier planning authority. As the strategic planning authority, Lothian region could, however, call in the application and, as a consequence of its intervention, 25 houses, instead of 500 houses, were part of the package. That is a graphic example of the achievement of the strategic planning authority. That is an example of development control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could have cited a similar case to show the strategic planning authority's ability to co-ordinate and promote positive development. I could give the example of a major economic development plan, such as that in West Lothian in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow, or of transport and highways. Much can and has been achieved by the regional planning authorities and it would be a tragedy if that were to be lost now. The only way of reintroducing that safeguard into the new system would be through the amendments, which would provide a statutory requirement for structure planning areas to be designated by the Secretary of State and appropriate boards, with teeth, to be established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A range of questions have been raised—I am going to do a "Linlithgow", if I may. Last night I had a discussion with David Jamie, the director of planning of Lothian region, and with David Costello, the chairman of Lothian region planning authority. Of the many questions that they asked, I shall raise only four, as they are particularly important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1080</span>
First, will the Minister accept the case that the main urban areas, especially Edinburgh, require to be covered by structure plan areas that extend to more than one local authority, when there are clear economic, social, transport and geographic relationships between the city and its hinterland? I am sure that the answer will be yes, but it will be useful to have that on record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, subsection (3) of the new section that clause 33 would create allows a situation when an area might be covered by one local plan, but more than one structure plan. Without starting again on local plans, how would a single local plan relate and conform to varying structure plan policy guidance across its area, without leading to great complexity and confusion? That is another important question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, is it seriously suggested that one local authority area could eventually have to implement structure plan policies, enforced on it as a result of the Secretary of State's decision, which had been promoted by a neighbouring authority and with which it did not agree and did not want? That would be a good recipe for conflict. The Minister could usefully reply to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, what powers will joint committees have to ensure that development adheres to approved structure plan policies, without powers to call in applications for development raising strategic issues?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are a few of the important points that have been raised. The points made by Opposition Members are amply supported by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and the Royal Town Planning Institute, so the Minister must respond to them. We could talk about transport planning, or about the second Forth road crossing, which is a piece of nonsense. If we were promoting co-ordinated railway services in Fife and in Lothian through strategic planning—which I am sure the strategic authorities would like to do, and we shall come on to that when we talk about passenger transport authorities—we would not need to consider the traffic that would be generated by a second Forth road bridge. We could also talk about urban renewal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister talks about breaking up the planning authorities in Lothian region. I would like to ask him, in view of the obvious connection between strategic planning and economic development, what is the future for Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise Limited? Will LEEL be broken up as well? That matter should be addressed, and it is connected to the issue that we are debating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is abundantly clear to me that we need an independent second tier strategic planning authority, which is best provided—and extremely well provided now—by Lothian region, Strathclyde region and the rest of them. If we are to be deprived of the present excellent structure, at the very least we must have statutory provision for structure plans to remain in place, and we must have effective and accountable joint planning boards to enforce our requirements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government should take heed of what happens when large authorities are broken up. I shall dwell
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0600">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1081</span>
for a moment on what happened in this city after the break up of the council into boroughs. What have the Government had to do? They have had to appoint a Minister for London in order to carry out the necessary co-ordination. When the London authority and the metropolitan counties were broken up there were all sorts of problems. Surely that should be a warning to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As always, Mr. Martin I shall be concise. In the Green Paper the Secretary of State recognised that the Glasgow and Edinburgh conurbations need to be planned over a large area. First, is that still the Minister's view? Secondly, if it is, does he accept the importance of specifying the areas involved at an early date across the central belt and around the cities of Aberdeen and Dundee?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, does the Minister accept that a joint committee cannot be effective as the participants' responsibility lies with their local interest? The proposed structure plan process clearly recognises that it is unrealistic to expect that prospective partners, such as the seven new authorities in the Clyde valley, will voluntarily agree when they inevitably find themselves in competition to secure new development; they will, conversely, have a mind to resist development despite the wider strategic need for it. That is the familiar NIMBY—"not in my backyard"—syndrome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Competition to obtain or to resist something may arise as the old days—over the years that was largely overcome by Strathclyde, Lothian and, I think, Tayside. That is a real problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, does not the Minister recognise that such a system, on which he will have to adjudicate, will involve great delay and will undermine the confidence of potential investors in the planning system? I cite two examples. One concerns Motorola coming to Bathgate in my constituency, which is very much of a Scottish Office teshowpiece. Motorola would not have come to Bathgate—or, indeed, Scotland had it not been for the quick reactions of not only the Scottish Office, to which I give a good deal of credit in that respect, but Lothian region, to which I also give a heck of a lot of credit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the American super management of Motorola world wide decided to hold their conference in the United Kingdom, they chose Cliveden. It was a remarkable experience. I asked what prompted the company to come to Bathgate. One answer—I do not make this up, for this can be checked with Mr. Fisher, or anyone else—is that there was a quick reaction from the regional council. A small council would not have been in a position to do that—[Hon. Members: "Why not?"]—because it would not have had the resources to put together a financial package in time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Scottish Office thinks differently, it had better say so. If the Minister agrees with the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch), let him say so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Kynoch 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Hon. Gentlemen raises an interesting point. Does he accept that local enterprise companies, in conjunction with
	<span class='label label-info column'>1082</span>
Scottish Enterprise and local authorities can, whatever the size of the local authority, put together a very sensible package—along with Locate in Scotland if it is from an outward investor—to bring industry to the area?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not in any way decry them, but I wonder whether a local enterprise company could have undertaken the massive infrastructure that was needed quickly. If the Minister dissents, I will be interested to hear what he has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In some ways I am sympathetic to the Hon. Gentlemen's remarks. One factor that probably swung it for Bathgate was the area's status. The fact that Bathgate enjoys special status following the removal of the car factory must have had a tremendous impact. The financial package could not have been put together in Perth, for example, because we would not have enjoyed the same financial support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Jimmy McGinley, the covenor of West Lothian district council, might disagree with what I am about to say, but an important factor in this case, and certainly with Nippon Electric, was that those companies could say in their own country that they were going not to West Lothian but to the Edinburgh area. The cachet of the city of Edinburgh, when it comes to incoming investment, is very important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the development industry, the Scottish House-Builders Association has voiced reservations about the consequences of reorganisation. It has expressed concern that effective strategic decision making will be lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fifth question is, although the Minister believes that joint committees can be effective, does not he agree that is only when they have a common cause? As strategic and transportation planning involves resolving conflicts of interest and choosing priorities, does he acknowledge that the joint committee system is inherently weak?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In paragraph 90.15 of the Green Paper, the Minister accepted that the more authorities involved in joint working, the more cumbersome co-ordination would become. It is also likely that there would be conflict between the individual authorities' interests and the collective interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My sixth question is, does not that argue the case for statutory joint boards for planning and transportation for, say, the Clydeside conurbation and the city of Edinburgh and its surroundings? I remind the Minister that Lothian region has brought my constituents great benefits, partly because it had strategic planning powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Green Paper clarifies the distinction between a joint committee and a joing board thus:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An important distinction between Joint Boards and the contract or Joint Committee models is that under the contract or joint committee models the individual regains its statutory responsibility for the service concerned, whereas under Joint Boards the authority shares its responsibility with other authorities."</p></blockquote>
My seventh question is, does not the Minister recognise that a structure plan for more than one authority is a shared
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0601">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1083</span>
responsibility that is more appropriate to a joint board than a joint committee? Does he not also recognise—this is question No. 8—that a joint committee cannot be effective if the Government allow alternative proposals to be included in joint structure plans under the provisions of schedule 4?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 33 provides for the new local planning authorities to prepare jointly a structure plan for more than one district—Scotland's cities and hinterlands. Schedule 4 states that where
	<br><blockquote><p>"the authorities concerned are unable to agree on a joint structure plan … each authority may include in the plan submitted to the Secretary of State alternative proposals in respect of particular matters."</p></blockquote>
Local plans must accord with the submitted structure plan and planning applications must have regard to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a submitted structure plans contains alternative proposals as schedule 4 anticipates, can the Minister say what the status of local plan guidance and development control will be? How are authorities to view such a submitted plan when considering appeals against a local planning authority's refusal of planning permission, or dealing with a local plan inquiry?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Question nine is, how does the Minister envisage the joint committees being advised? Will they have their own staff to prepare, monitor and review strategies, and to maintain databases? I stick by what I said earlier about databases. I have gone back to various people, and sent them copies of 	<i>Hansard.</i> I stand by everything that I said about the difficulties and costs of the transfer of databases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My 10th question is, if the Minister believes that unitary authorities will be able to handle this work, is he not betraying a lack of understanding of the task in hand? In areas such as Lothian and Strathclyde, strategic and transportation planning requires difficult decisions to be taken on priorities across boundaries. Does the Minister accept that this requires an organisation with a dedicated staff mandated to perform what is, after all, an important statutory function.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire moved the amendment, he said that it was non-contentious. It might be if one sees the world from St. Boswells, but if one sees it from Edinburgh or Glasgow, I imagine that it is extremely contentious. There are no nasty overtones in that remark. I merely point out that there is a considerable difference between conditions in the Borders and what some of us perceive as the problems of central Scotland, which we have lived with for a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Question No. 11 relates to the development plan, which comprises the structure plan and local plans. Where structure areas cross unitary authority boundaries, is it not important to clarify in legislation, at the same level, the system for both local and strategic planning?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Elletson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blackpool, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little confused. The hon. Gentleman said that he had come to
	<span class='label label-info column'>1084</span>
the 11th of his questions. I think that I have counted at least 15. I wonder how many my hon. Friend the Minister has counted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is important is how many 	<i>Hansard</i> counts. I use this method to make it easier to read the questions seriatim. To put it bluntly, the House of Commons Committee system leaves much to be desired in such complicated matters. Nor is it wholly reasonable to ask Ministers, even when they have such competant civil servants to help them as Mr. Affolter and Mr. Firth to give detailed answers off the top of their heads at such a late hour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that our proceedings are clear to two groups of people who will read 	<i>Hansard:</i> the many interested people in Scotland, and the members of the other House. Part of the reason for such detailed questions is so that their Lordships can peruse them and, if the answers are unsatisfactory, table suitable amendments. My method is geared to Lords amendments and to the Report stage of the Bill. That is why I ask all these questions. I have never, I hope, been unreasonable, although on one occasion I thought that the Minister should have answered immediately some questions from Councillor Charles Gray. Those questions were so simple that people who can propose a Bill such as this jolly well should know the answers off the top of their heads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that I must progress to question No. 12. Is it not onanomalous that rural regions such as Borders, Dumfries and Galloway and Highland will have arrangements for local and strategic planning in place from the outset but that the complex areas of the conurbations and the major cities will not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I have received information that the civil servants are organising a sweepstake on how many questions each day my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow will ask. Is that in order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the Committee we do not refer to strangers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Plus ça change, Mr. Martin. I was once on the same Committee as our late, valued, honoured and lovely colleague Ian Mikardo, who was then the hon. Member for Tower Hamlets. He organised a sweepstake on exactly the same basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My next question is No. 13. If the new authorities are being put in place between April 1995 and April 1996, does the Minister not accept that the joint working arrangements need to be put in place at the same time? Question No. 14: The Government intend to create a plan-led system which would make the development plan—structure and local plan together—the prime consideration in all planning matters Under the Bill, it will not be clear what constitutes the plan until the Secretary of State issues his decision. With a submission and alternative proposals to consider, increased delay in the decision making process is inevitable. How does the Minister think that all that can be done if the areas for joint working are not specified at an early date?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0602">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1085</span>
I believe that the next question is my 15th. Does the Minister recognise that if the joint working arrangements are not put in place at the same time as the new authorities, the specialist staff are likely to be lost to alternative employment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I was asked what above all else worried me about the proposals, I would say it is the dissipation of expert teams that have been built up over years. The truth is that once Humpty Dumpty is broken—if that is the proper collective noun for distinguished planners—he cannot be put together again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My 16th question relates to clause 33 4A(3), which allows that an area might be covered by one local plan, but more than one structure plan. Without starting again on local plans, how would a single local plan relate and confirm to varying structure plan policy guidelines without leading to complexity and confusion?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My 17th quesion is; how are the public, in being encouraged to participate in plan preparation, expected to understand the complexity of the arrangements of plan preparation when there could be local variations in the relationships between structure plans and local plans?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My 18th question is; what procedure will the Secretary of State follow to resolve conflict between local authorities after receiving alternative structure plan submission?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My 19th question is; will the Secretary of State decide on such matters as disagreements about long-term development patterns and the general locations for development or restraint, and other matters clearly not covered by national planning policies and guidelines?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My 20th question is; is it seriously being suggested that one local authority area could eventually have to implement structure plan policies—enforced on it as a result of the Secretary of State's decision—which had been promoted by a neighbouring authority and which it did not agree with or want?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My 21st question is; how can the public be expected to understand the bureaucratic procedures of a situation where they are consulted on alternative structure plan submissions, and where the Secretary of State also effectively becomes involved at an earlier stage?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My 22nd question is; what powers will joint committees have to ensure development adheres to approved structure plan policies, without powers to call in applications for developments raising strategic issues?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My penultimate question—[Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] My hon. Friends should be thankful for how lucky they are. There are another 53 questions which they will be spared.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is unwise not to give way to the Whip.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1086</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should warn by hon. Friend that I plan to incercept his mail as from Monday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My Whip is a man of great wit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My penultimate question is about green belts. Green belts cross local authority boundaries and complement the urban renewal and regeneration initiatives. They are a fundamental part of strategic planning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Strathclyde and Lothian regions have established comprehensive green belts around greater Glasgow and Edinburgh. How will they be sustained under a unitary system? That is a priority question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, community woodlands. Strathclyde's "Greening the Conurbation" initiative covers 14 district council areas, as does the community woodland plan. The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro), did me the courtesy of visiting my constituency, and very welcome he was. He examined community woodland plans and knows that the matter is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regions have put in finance and technical expertise, and secure aid from the Forestry Commission, Scottish Natural Heritage and European sources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both Strathclyde and Lothian regions have established community woodland plans for their strategic green belt and set up joint projects to secure implementation and after care. How will those be sustained under a unitary system? Like many of my questions, I hope that these will appeal to their Lordships, even if they do not immediately appeal to the Committee. I fear that some of us will nag and nag until we get answers. It is no good the Government presenting a Bill such as this on a subject as central as planning without being able to answer these questions first.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with the greatest of interest, as always, to the hon. Member for Linlithgow and his 27 questions. As the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire said, it was the appetiser for our discussions on clause 33. I do not know how many questions the hon. Gentleman will have for the fish course and the soup to follow. I was surprised at the criticisms levelled by the hon. Member for Linlithgow because he received a letter from a most respected and distinguished planner who he knows personally—Mr. David Jarman, the head of planning of West Lothian district council—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was from Jimmy McGinley.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right—enclosed with the letter was a paper from the head of the hon. Gentleman's own district council. That distinguished planner said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The district council supports clause 33 as it stands …"</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The letter from James McGinley confirms my worst fears.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Is the Minister giving way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon. Gentleman will have another opportunity to take part in the debate later if he wishes to do so. My point is simple: the hon. Gentleman received a copy of the letter from convenor McGinley enclosing a paper from David Jarman, the respected and distinguished head of planning of his district council. That paper starts:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The District Council supports clause 33 as it stands and is opposed to any amendments which propose the creation of statutory joint boards with call-in or direction powers".</p></blockquote>
The paper is sensible and coherent and I am surprised that the Member of Parliament representing that council did not refer to it in what was not the shortest speech that I have heard in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall refer, seriatim, to some of Mr. Jarman's points later in the proceedings tonight or tomorrow morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, rightly and properly, made some general comments about the current planning system. He mentioned voluntary planning arrangements and how structure plans have developed. The example of the Clyde valley regional plan in 1946 is instructive. It was one of the finest regional structure plans ever produced. It set the scene for most of what has happened in the west of Scotland from 1946 to the present day. The consultants were engaged by the Clyde valley regional planning advisory committee which was set up by—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A Labour Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) reminds me, it was set up by any excellent Labour Secretary of State for Scotland, the right hon. Tom Johnston. It consisted of 18 local authorities within the area of the plan. As its title suggests, the role of the committee was advisory. One of its functions was to produce an outline plan, which was intended to form the basis or groundwork for the statutory planning schemes of individual local authorities. It was an outstanding plan and an outstanding example of co-operation between local authorities. It was prepared by a full-time staff of about a dozen people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an example of a regional plan that was produced and was highly successful on a voluntary basis. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire is a lad compared to other members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with some of the general points that the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire and other hon. Members have raised. On a structure plan and a local plan, may I make it clar that there is no question of constituent authorities preparing their own plans. There can be one structure plan only for any area designated for that purpose. When authorities cannot agree on a joint structure plan for the designated area, the Bill provides that they should include alternative proposals, in respect of particular matters, in the plans submitted to my right
	<span class='label label-info column'>1088</span>
hon. Friend the Secretary of State. That provides an authority with an opportunity to object to the part of the plan with which it disagrees. I hope that that answers the point about disputes raised by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In most cases, we do not expect alternative proposals to emerge. The point about joint working is to reach agreement about the proposals included in the plan. In the worst-case scenario—I accept that we must consider that—it will be for the dissenting authority to make clear its reasons for its alternative proposals, so that the public know why a difference of view has emerged. That is not terribly different from the present position, in which district councils can and do object to structure plans submitted by a regional council. Such alternative plans are available to the public and, eventually the Secretary of State has to take a decision on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Lothian asked me a right and proper question about the relationship between a local plan and a structure plan. I can reassure him on that. There is already a requirement in legislation for local plans to conform to the structure plan. There cannot be an imcompatability between the two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Linlithgow, referred to structure plan areas in relation to cities. The consultation paper "Shaping the New Councils", to which hon. Members referred, makes it clear that, especially around the major cities, development opportunities and conservation issues need to be examined concerning areas that reflect those within which people travel to work, shop or search for a new house. Those areas generally extend beyond existing districts. Therefore, structure plans should be co-ordinated with plans for infrastructure, particularly roads and transport, that also cover areas wider than existing districts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On determining the areas for structure plans, I can give the Committee the assurance that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will consider those relevant matters and will consult with the authorities involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be helpful if we had some idea of the time scale for that, because time is running short.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the point of amendments Nos. 347 and 377, which have been tabled by Opposition Members. I hope that we will be able to prescribe these areas reasonably quickly. It is not sensible to have a specific date in the Bill, as the amendment proposes, because considerations will vary between different parts of Scotland, as hon. Members have rightly suggested. We will need to consult the existing authorities and the new authorities, which will have to be up and running at least as shadow authorities before consultation with them can take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the hon. Gentleman's point about the need for those areas to be prescribed reasonably quickly. However, I do not think that it is sensible to put a specific date in the Bill, as proposed in the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Knapman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stroud)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend be a little more specific about time? During these deliberations
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0604">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1089</span>
planning applications are on ice, and, there may even be a planning blight if there is a long delay. Could my hon. Friend be a little more specific about the time scale?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can reassure my hon. Friend. There is no question of any planning blight or delay in individual planning decisions, because all the existing plans are in force. The existing structure and local plans continue. Indeed, the west Lothian submission, to which I referred earlier, makes the point very specifically that it does not see any need for further consideration of structure plan issues until 2001. I can absolutely assure my hon. Friend that there is no question of planning blight or of planning authorities not being able to make planning decisions during the transitional period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Linlithgow asked me 27 questions and I shall endeavour to answer as many of them as I can during our debate. He was in order in asking questions on these amendments, but some of his questions related more specifically to other amendments in later groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked me about the staffing of joint committees. The staff would come from the authorities—it is a matter for the authorities themselves. Joint committees are unable to employ staff directly: the authorities are the employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire made a reference to Stodart and no unity of view. I hope that I covered that point earlier when I referred to individual authorities being able to propose alternatives. He also raised an important point when he asked whether joint boards or joint committees would have at least one representative from each constituent council. Perhaps I could answer that at this stage, Mr. Martin, because it applies not just to planning but more generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer the hon. Gentleman to section 235 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which requires members of joint committees and joint boards to be appointed by the relevant constituent councils. Although there is no particular requirement that all councils are represented on a board or committee, I cannot envisage any local authority joining a board or committee without being represented on it. I can assure the Committtee that the Government will not use the powers available under clause 20 to set up a joint board unless all the constituent councils are to be represented on it. I am happy to give that assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to return specifically to the amendments before us. I have referred to amendments Nos. 347 and 377 and have given the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire an assurance that while I am completely sympathetic to his point, I do not think that specifying a date is necessarily sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 335, 347 and 377 would impose a specific duty on my right hon. Friend to designate structure plan areas. My hon. Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) was technically right in what he said. There is no
	<span class='label label-info column'>1090</span>
difference of view between the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire and the Government on this, but technically the matter is already covered. I shall explain why, against the background of an absolute assurance that the inclusion of a permissive power rather than a mandatory requirement, as the amendment suggests, should in no sense be construed as a means for my right hon. Friend not to designate structure plans areas. Designation of such areas is an essential aspect of the proposed arrangements for structure planning to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall expand on the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham by saying that the proposed section 4A(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1972, which is to be inserted by clause 33, specifically requires that the district of every planning authority in Scotland shall be included in a structure plan area. There is, therefore, already an obligation on my right hon. Friend to designate such areas, and it would be his intention to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister care to define "district" in the context of this provision, because that would illuminate further discussions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: District refers to the 1972 Act, where it is defined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it a district council?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is an area, not a district council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is just as well that we are here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. No one denies the expertise of the hon. Member for Fife, Central in such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to continue my explanation of the position. There is accordingly no question of strategic issues not being addressed. The reason that the permissive "may" is used in section 4A(1) is that, while section 4A(2) clearly obliges the Secretary of State initially to include the district of every planning authority in a structure plan area, the use of the word "shall" in subsection (1) might cast doubt on his ability to make later orders varying the initial ones, if that should prove necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire has followed that explanation—I am sure that he has. I checked the matter during our break and I am glad to be able to give him an absolute assurance that the purpose of amendments Nos. 335, 347 and 377 is met by the present legislation. I hope that he will therefore feel able to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The inability of joint committees to employ staff is an argument for a joint board. Under a joint committee staff would have to obtain jobs with the unitary authority and then be seconded. The existing teams would be broken up. That is a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter from councillor James McGinley confirms my worst fears that authorities such as West Lothian will go their own way on strategic issues and not co-operate in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0605">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1091</span>
pursuing objectives other than their own. The letter shows why voluntary arrangements will not work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper "This Common Inheritance: Britain's Environmental Strategy" refers to the need to balance conservation with economic restructuring. It states at paragraph 20.9:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Local authority structure plans and policies played a major part in meeting these challenges with an outstanding degree of success which is not always publicly recognised."</p></blockquote>
Lothian region structure plan has closely followed those principles and West Lothian has been by far the greatest beneficiary of a policy that has skewed resources in its favour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman has been as good as gold about keeping to the amendments, but he is now doing what I asked him not to do—reading letters into the record. I will not allow that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a letter; it is an anticipatory note. I thought that the Minister's tactic would be to throw in that letter, which made us nearly burst a blood vessel in our anger this morning, and therefore I prepared a note. It is my note.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the collapse of British Leyland and other heavy industries, unemployment in the Bathgate area in 1984 was 18.3 per cent. With a strategic policy for environmental improvements and economic regeneration backed by regional resources and commitment, however, the environment and economy of the area have been transformed. Unemployment was 10.6 per cent. in January 1994. The area is now, following the recent arrival of Motorola, a world electronics centre. That firm alone benefited from £2 million of aid for training from the regional council, as well as £600,000 in infrastructure. Is it realistic to imagine that an authority as small as West Lothian could find resources swiftly to secure a firm such as Motorola for Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Could you rule, for the benefit of the Committee, on the acceptability of reading a letter or an anticipatory note into the record?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Economic regeneration is a strategic issue which requires strategic resources beyond the ability of smaller authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument for strategic planning by statutory board may not be supported by West Lothian, but it is certainly supported by organisations such as the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Things are difficult enough. The Member for Linlithgow is reading a speech, contrary to the rules of the House. I ask him to desist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1092</span>
The Minister will recollect the letter of 28 January that he received from the RICS, which argues that joint committees should be independently financially resourced, capable of influencing capital and revenue budgets for major strategic services and able to ensure that development and local plans adhere to the structure plan policies. Key planning issues transcend district boundaries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elletson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. It appears that the hon. Gentleman is still reading to the Committee. Would not the solution be for the Minister to send an anticipatory note to the hon. Member answering all his questions and other concerns?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Linlithgow is approaching the stage at which he is close to defying the Chair. I am sorry to fall out with him about this. I have asked him not to read his speech. He knows the rules of the House far better than anyone, including me, yet he continues to do that. If he keeps on in that manner, I must ask him to resume his seat, although I shall be reluctant to ask such a long-serving Member of Parliament to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalywell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Without a note, I must just say that I hope that the Government will consider the real problems of the Esk valley and the Almond valley graded schemes, which are classic examples of precisely the issues that I am raising. For time reasons and other reasons, I shall leave the matter there.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regional council operates an indicative forestry strategy, which has been drawn together in co-operation with the Forestry Commission and covers the points of interest of all the parties involved. Obviously, it covers tree planting and management.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that my hon. Friend is deeply committed to our feathered friends and I wonder whether the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds has been involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be less than honest of me to say that the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds has not lobbied on the matter. The subject is also of interest to many of my constituents and I have received letters from many people who are involved in environmental issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are the existing statutory powers sufficient to ensure that the new authorities will still operate indicative forestry strategies, will co-operate with each other and will consult the Forestry Commission in drawing up those strategies and an overall plan? The spirit behind the amendment is right in ensuring that that is encouraged and maintained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a funny feeling that I shall be interrupted again—that seems to be my fate this evening. It is important to discuss transportation and land use. The hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside referred to amendment No. 213 on forestry, which has been prompted by the RSPB.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to begin with a few words on transportation, which is important and it is a pity that we cannot devote more time to it. Strategic transport planning is of almost supreme importance to many of our constituents. I can cite my recent experience of working with neighbouring strategic planning authorities to put the case for upgrading the Al road. But for co-operation between Lothian region, Borders region and Northumberland county council, I suspect that the Minister responsible for roads in Scotland and his counterpart in England would not have accepted the case for upgrading that strategic road. Therefore, some headway was made there. It is important to have such a strategic approach to planning highways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same point can be made about rail services. How does the Secretary of State expect landward authorities to maintain the same level of investment in rail services when the majority of benefits are realised in the area of another authority? I particularly have in mind Lothian region's investment in railway services for commuters resident in my constituency of East Lothian. Lothian put a lot of money into electrifying the North Berwick branch line. It co-operated with East Lothian district and others to provide parking provision at many stations in East
	<span class='label label-info column'>1094</span>
Lothian. That is predominantly for the benefit of reducing traffic and parking congestion in the city of Edinburgh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A strategic authority that covers the city of Edinburgh and the outlying areas makes possible such planning, but will it be possible in future? How on earth can outlying areas be expected to invest substantial sums of money to reduce traffic congestion in neighbouring city areas? That point must be dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be complicated to plan bus services when a number of neighbouring authorities are responsible for subsidising and co-ordinating them. Many more bus routes will cross over new authority boundaries in future and that will cause problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
	<p>10.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming—</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We were having a brief debate on a group of amendements dealing with transportation and land use. I spoke about the importance of maintaining strategic planning authorities for roads planning, for investment in rail services and, for bus services. I was about to speak about concessionary travel by bus and rail, about which hon. Members have received much correspondence. People are worried that the high quality concessionary travel schemes which operate on a regional basis in many parts of Scotland will be dismembered as a result of the Bill. What provision will be made to cover the extra administrative costs that will fall on the several authorities and operators that may be involved in highly complex new concessionary travel schemes stradling a number of different local authorities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, will the Minister earmark funds to pay for the extra costs falling on landward authorities to maintain the concessionary travel benefits available to residents in their areas after 1 April 1996? That is of special importance in constituencies such as mine. At present Lothian, a flat-rate concessionary fare scheme applies to rail and bus services of 30p per journey regardless of length. The same rate applies from Dunbar to Bargate or into Edinburgh. Obviously, the shorter journeys in the City of Edinburgh mean that the scheme would not cost as much. There, the cost of bus or train journeys averages 56p. Therefore, the subsidy for the local authority amounts to no more than 26p per journey. That is still substantial, but the sum is much greater in the landward areas. In East Lothian in my constituency and in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow the average cost per concessionary travel journey is 80p. That means that a subsidy of 50p is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that the disruption of the local authorities will mean that the concessionary travel schemes will be much more expensive. It is likely that people in outlying areas will not have the benefit of such schemes. I hope that the Minister will explain that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0607">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1095</span>
I turn now to land use. We have tabled two amendments on behalf of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. The hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside mentioned amendment No. 213, which would require neighbouring local authorities to produce a strategic plan for woodlands and forestry in their areas. That plan should take full account of a wide range of matters, including nature conservation, and should form part of the structure plan. Such strategies are currently produced by most regional councils and provide excellent strategic guidance on which local authorities base their comments to the forestry authority about proposed tree planting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an important matter. Some hon. Members will have constituency experience of uncontrolled afforestation. It is difficult for the Forestry Commission to act as a planning authority. A case can be made for structure planning in the interests of nature conservation as well as protection of the landscape.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 214 deals with coastal plans. It would require local authorities around estuaries and along the coast to take a strategic overview and produce a development plan that would help to reconcile conflicting demands on the coast, such as industrial development, wildlife conservation, recreation and amenity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is insufficient control at present. The Crown Estate Commissions are supposed to be the planning authority for everything below the high water mark. Not long ago, a Kent-based company proposed to open the equivalent of a super quarry just below the high water mark off the coast of my constituency. It intended to extract millions of tonnes of marine aggregate or gravel. It is bizarre that a lady in a cottage on shore would require planning consent to add a dormer window to a house when a company based in Kent could extract vast quantities from the sea-bed regardless of the consequences on fisheries, wildlife and everything else in that area. We managed to fight off that proposal. It is a sign, however, of the lack of adequate control, and of the need for structural and strategic planning and proper controls and co-operation between neighbouring authorities to protect wildlife and the marine environment. I hope that the Minister will deal with those important points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are hundreds of square miles of forestry and plantations in my constituency. In some sense, I have to declare an interest because the forestry industry is an important employer in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the plantations that have been created in the past 30 years have not been as wise as one would have wished. Some of the best views in Perthshire have been changed substantially by blanket afforestation. I make it clear, however, that I favour the planting of trees. I have planted a few on my land. I do not want people to suggest that I plant trees while arguing that other people should not. However, we require proper and strategic planning for forestry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An important element in that is roads. It is one thing to plant trees, but, once they mature and grow, we have the problem of getting them out. We faced big problems and

Gentleman is using the word varieties out of context and he could unwittingly mislead the Committee. He is talking about genera and species. Varieties are the natural variation of a plant. They are similar to a cultivar, which is a man-induced variety. A genus is more like the scots pine, pinus sylvestris, or metasequoia glyptostroboides—that is what the hon. Gentleman is talking about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who am I to argue with such an expert? I was talking about barytes, which is mineral. It is used in the drilling and exploration of oil in the North sea. Large deposits of barytes are found in north Perthshire and they are valuable to the United Kingdom economy. Large vehicles are needed to transport that mineral. Roads that were designed for less traffic are not suitable for the transport of barytes.

The hon. Member for Paisley, South is much too substantial for me to argue with. I would not dream of doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I leave the Committee to determine what I meant. I can only say that I am glad that my hon. Friend the Whip is not of the same proportions. Because I am glad of that, I shall not tread too far out of line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we are considering strategic planning and what should or should not happen, we cannot ignore the economic importance of forestry and minerals and the need to have adequate roads to transport logs and minerals. Therefore, that has to be taken into account in a structure plan. That is why the Bill and the clause are important. I welcome the opportunity to say a few words about them, because, when discussing strategic planning, it is important that Perthshire is studied within the context or one area. I am pleased that the proposed Perth and Kinross council will cover all of that area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elletson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel a little hesitant to speak on this particular topic of land use when, as the son of an English yeoman, I look across the Room and see the great socialist land-owning barons from Scotland—the hon. Members for Linlithgow and for East Lothian. We even have the Laird of Carrick who, every morning, looks out of castle Foulkes and, no doubt down to the banks of the Doon while considering amendment No. 214.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned about the amendment. I am a member of the Select Committee on the Environment, which has just produced a report on coastal management. I draw the Committee's attention to that because it concerned coastal zone protection and planning. It recommended a hierarchy of coastal zone management plans from the national level to regional and local levels. It proposed to encourge—rather than compel—the preparation of management plans for reparation for relevant stretches of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0608">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1097</span>
the coast. Planning policy guidance note No. 20 is relevant, as it governs English legislation on that issue. That is an important point because the legislation and planning policy guidelines are not the same in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Planning policy guidance note No. 20 in England encourages strategic co-operation between local authorities around estuaries and along the coast in development plan preparations. The same policy planning guidelines do not exist in Scotland. I understand that the planning policy guidelines are now 20 years old and will be revised and updated to encourage the preparation of coastal plans. That is what the amendment is all about. I hope that that will encourage the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only reservations that I have concern compelling authorities to undertake the process, rather than encouraging them. While we have the greatest sympathy with the drift of the proposal, many of my English colleagues and I would be worried about compelling local authorities to act. I urge the Minister to consider that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I reassure my hon. Friends the Members for Tayside, North and for Kincardine and Deeside on their important points about forestry. Current legislation is widely cast and structured planning authorities are free to prepare forestry strategies, and are encouraged to do so, as part of their structured plans, where they judged that to be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An alteration to the Highland regional council structure plan is currently with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for his approval. The strategies show areas favoured for forestry and those areas in which it is less likely to be acceptable because of wildlife, landscape or amenity reasons. I assure my hon. Friends on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee welcomed the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North—[Mr. Elletson]——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend leaves the question of forestry, will there be encouragement for co-operation between local authorities under the new set-up? At the moment, it is covered by one regional authority, but, under the new set-up, with several different authorities, will there be encouragement to ensure that there is full co-operation between them in drawing up the indicative forestry strategies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, my hon. Friend is absolutely right. That would be part of the structured plan process. My hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North was right to refer to the Environment Select Committee's report. He asked about our response, in Scotland, to it. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State proposes to issue a discussion paper on the coast this summer. It will set out our views on the future framework for the sustainable use of the coast of Scotland. It is possible that in circumstances where particular problems or pressures related to coastal development or conservation arise, local coastal plans could have a part to play. My hon. Friend will
	<span class='label label-info column'>1098</span>
be more than welcome to take part in that consultative process and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will look forward to receiving his views when the discussion paper is published.

The hon. Member for East Lothian raised a range of transport issues, some of which apply to later clauses. He ranged wider than planning matters. The White Paper stated that the continuation of structure planning means that a general framework will also be available to allow authorities to co-ordinate local road and transport schemes across council boundaries where necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The legislation in respect of structure plans is widely cast; authorities are free to include and co-ordinate land use and transportation issues in their plans when they consider it appropriate to do so.

I hope that I have been able to reassure the Committee on those three issues. We shall return to the transport issues when we reach the relevant clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I come to what I hope will be an opportunity for the Minister to give the Committee a clear idea of the Government's view of the relative merits of using joint committees as opposed to joint boards in the context of structure plans and strategic planning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key phrase in the amendment is joint boards. There is a clear and definite advantage in having joint boards rather than joint committees. The reasons for that are, in principle, straightforward. We must ensure that valid and desirable development proposals are not frustrated by a
	<span class='label label-info column'>1100</span>
paraochial approach, based on parochial attitudes and NIMBYism and all that that entails. That is much easier to guard against in the formal structure of a joint board as opposed to a joint committee. The best way to make effective cross-boundary choices to ensure that development proposals that have a major adverse impact outwith the local authority area are not promoted and to ensure that a beggar-my-neighbour attitude does not prevail, is to have boards rather than committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a distinct legal difference between a joint committee and a joint board. The joint board structure has a legal persona and is an entity in its own right. It is separate and at arm's length from the unitary authorities that would send members to sit on such a joint board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall take a moment to consider the implications. The Minister will correct me if I am wrong—I am not an expert on the issue—but it seems that if a joint committee approach were adopted for structure planning, there would immediately be doubts about the capacity of any such committee to comment on individual authorities, given that those authorities will retain their statutory responsibility for structure planning. The capacity of a joint committee to comment on individual authorities is in doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"Local objections" will be given the same status in a submitted plan as proposals that have been prepared from a strategic overview in a joint committee context. That is not desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Individual authorities will have powers to make representations about local interests affected by the Secretary of State's decisions if they are involved in a joint committee for structure plans. The Minister has said that joint committees do not have the legal title to employ staff, so a separate secretariat will be needed to ensure that the impartiality and independence of the professional staff is beyond question. That takes me back to the earlier point about a conflict of interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The collective decisions of the joint committees would tend to be nothing more than the sum of their separate interests rather than true, strategic choices by a board specially constituted for the purpose. Decision making in a joint committee would be a long-winded process because of the relationship with its parent bodies. There would be a propensity for a joint committee to experience much greater difficulty in making tough decisions that involve choices between one geographical area and another in the authorities that constitute the joint committee. So there are problems about going down the joint committee route.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the joint board would be termed a quango. Do not Opposition Members complain about the number of quangos that have been established recently?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not comment on quangos. I am trying to concentrate on this matter. There is a clear choice —[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I seem to have had an effect on the air-conditioning system, which is perhaps the biggest impact that I shall have on this Committee. It must be the shuttle to Glasgow. Sorry, Mr. Martin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0610">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1101</span>
I shall conclude by referring to some of the implications and benefits that would accrue if the Government adopted the system of joint boards rather than joint committees. It would create a much clearer distinction between the body responsible for the preparation of the structure plan and the unitary authority that represents local interests. There would be a much clearer demarcation between those duties and roles if there were a legal entity constituted in the joint board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision of a single structure plan authority would ensure a consistent and equitable approach to the process, much more so than if we were stuck with joint committees. There would be a much clearer distinction between the local objections to the plan and proposals prepared from a strategic perspective. For that reason, a joint board is preferable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rights of a unitary authority to make legal representations when there is local concern about the Secretary of State's decisions or use of his default powers would be much more clearly retained. They might be lost in a committee set-up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Professional staff would not be seen as advisers to a unitary authority, because they would be full-blown employees of that body and would have a clear line of management, with duties and responsibilities that would flow from that. All in all, the joint board would be a much more streamlined process of decision making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A joint board system would help the Secretary of State because it would minimise the occasions on which he would have to get involved in order to resolve a demarcation dispute. A joint board would be in a much more powerful position to do that for him and would prevent him becoming involved any more than he had to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have a clear choice. I am not an expert, but am clear that it would cost the Government nothing to choose joint boards as opposed to joint committees. That is not a big deal. There are clear and cogent advantages to joint boards. The amendment may be techincally defective, but I am prepared to accept that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government would give an assurance that they will examine the matter again, I would be happy to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall merely reinforce the points made by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point has been well made that if there is a voluntarily constructed joint committee, which is given the Secretary of State's approval, there will be chaos. I hope that the Minister accepts that. Effective strategic planning, structure planning and integration with transportation planning is currently delivered smoothly. It would be a pity if a move was made to a system in which local plans were developed within unitary authorities, but there was no overview of the strategic planning framework.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter is not only important to local authorities and major regions, but the business community. It wants
	<span class='label label-info column'>1102</span>
stability and certainty, it does not want major applications for industrial, housing and commercial developments to be bogged down in internal wrangles between organisations that talk a great deal but have no strategic decision-taking function. The Secretary of State would be involved at every level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister meant what he said about decentralisation, there must be bodies that can act on behalf of all the interests of the community without constant resort to the exercise of the Secretary of State's powers. The best example is Strathclyde.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One or two authorities might not like the idea of Big Brother and local plans being compromised by structure plans. Will they participate in a voluntary committtee? If a number of authorities ask the Secretary of State to establish a committee, what will happen? It would be easier to accept in a non-philosophical way that joint boards would be helpful from the start rather than produce them at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The drift of the Government's thinking shows that there will be strategic levels of water delivery under three quangos. There will be police committees, fire committees, education joint committees and social work joint committees. It is a simple, logical step to acknowledge from the start that strategic planning requires an overview including the requirements that we support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government at least accept that there is a problem with the transition and the permanent deployment of strategic and structure planning, they might want to undertake other discussions with COSLA and with the appropriate planning organisations, such as the Royal Town Planning Institute. That would send a message of good will and acknowledge that there are problems without making concessions about how the problems might be resolved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can tell the hon. Members for Fife, Central and for Roxburgh and Berwickshire that the Government have considered the matter carefully. It is not a question of philosophy, but of practicality and what would work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government favour a voluntary approach where possible. There is no fundamental reason why voluntary joint workings should not be successful, but I am sufficiently pragmatic to realise that it may not work. That is the essential point argued by Opposition Members. I assure them that we will consult and monitor progress carefully. In the event of a failure of a group of authorities to make progress on a joint structure plan, it will be able under clause 20 to request my right hon. Friend to set up a joint board. He will also have the powers to do so himself; we are taking necessary reserve powers.
