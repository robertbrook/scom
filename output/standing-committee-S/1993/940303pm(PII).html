	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that my hon. Friends are in good heart and looking forward to a spirited debate with those on the Government Benches. I am not sure that they are as keen as we are; nevertheless, we shall push on before I encourage your wrath, Sir James. I have just been handed an excellent document entitled "The Fulfilled Society", which mentions the Secretary of State for Scotland, the right hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Lang). I recommend the publication to Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was talking about the voluntary sector—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Sir Hector Monro)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has nothing to do with the voluntary sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that it has nothing to do with the voluntary sector. He should reflect on that comment. In the transition from the old to the new system, the voluntary group will suffer badly from the ill conceived transitional arrangements proposed. The excellent job done by staff in the voluntary sector in Scotland could be jeopardised if these harebrained causes are pursued. The amendments would require a greater depth of consideration than the Government have given them. The voluntary sector is only one of a myriad of organisations in Scottish business and economic life that local authorities influence. When we talk about the voluntary sector we include a range of organisations that will suffer as a consequence of the mish-mash of the transitional period; and of course, if those organisations suffer, people will suffer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has introduced a completely new scene that needs exploration. Will he speculate on what might happen to grants, through organisations such as Age Concern, to arts bodies like the Edinburgh festival, to sports bodies and above all to the scouts, of whom the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) is the interplanetary president? What will happen to those organisations during the transition period? Will my hon. Friend speculate for an hour or for a moment—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I know that the hon. Gentleman will not speculate and I urge the hon. Member not to try to persuade him to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>836</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Sir James. I did not want to encourage your wrath. My hon. Friend is an expert on the voluntary sector; he served with distinction as director of Age Concern and people throughout Scotland still talk about the wonderful work done by that organisation, which will suffer in the transitional period if the Government do not take the clause and the amendments as seriously as do the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that the voluntary sector was only one part of the overall picture: local government is involved in other issues. The Government have no idea of how local authorities reach out to every aspect of life in Scotland. At some time during this crazy reorganisation, the Government must think about people, because that is what local government is all about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would force the Government to think about some of the issues that they have completely ignored. They want only to satisfy the zealots in the Scottish Office and in Tory party headquarters that progress has been made in ripping up the map of Scotland, without concern for the services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall keep to the amendments, Sir James, as I want to save some of my energy for the next group in which we shall discuss the overall costs and the limits on what borrowing consent or grants the Government are willing to give.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When will we start to talk about costs? That question is puzzling and deeply disconcerting for the Opposition. Clause 25 is about the costs of transition. We are alarmed that one clause transfers capping powers and another relates to transition. The Government know that they will face many court battles about transferring staff but they turn a blind eye to that because they simply do not care. When the Bill is enacted, every staff member in Scotland will be up for grabs. There is no guarantee that they will be transferred: the Secretary of State will act by order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the one hand there is a crazy set up which will affect staff, on the other, the Government cannot agree on costs. Touche Ross started the ball rolling and it ended with the financial memorandum to the Bill. As if we needed something to underline the lunacy of the financial arrangements, the Government want us to believe that from 1996–97 there will be massive, multi-million-pound savings. The new single tier will start in 1996 if the crazy scheme goes ahead. Who in his right mind thought that there would be savings in the first year? The change will barely be round the necks of the new conveners, provosts or chairmen, but the Government say that there will be massive savings. The Government must bring an end to this lunacy and return to the reality of the issues raised in Committee. We shall discuss that in great length in the next amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The voluntary sector will be one of the main casualties of the Government's adventurous forays into local government reorganisation. We attempted to table an amendment to discuss the issue but it was not possible to do so. I hope, however, that in their response to the debate the Government will discuss the voluntary sector, the £ 100 million that it receives and the excellent services that it provides, often in conjunction with local authorities and with central Government agencies. We have an excellent opportunity now to put on the record Government and Opposition commitment to the voluntary sector's valuable contribution. It is equally important to reassure that sector that if this madness proceeds further its
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0468">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>837</span>
safeguards will be guaranteed. The Government should guarantee that support this evening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause is not about the voluntary sector, but I can tell the hon. Gentleman that I am meeting representatives of that sector tomorrow to discuss their point of view. It will, no doubt, be expressed with greater expertise than the hon Gentleman showed in stating his position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is in a bad mood.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in an extremely affable mood but I am still not giving way to the hon. Gentleman. I am glad that the hon. Member for Dundee, East has buttoned up his waistcoat, thus improving the Committee's sartorial elegance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a limited clause and a narrow set of amendments. The shadow authorities will not deliver services or be involved in making grants to the voluntary organisations to which the hon. Member for Fife, Central referred. We are discussing the financing of the new authorities in the year up to 1 April 1996. They will not supply services or be responsible for setting council tax levels.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will not the Minister accept that they will be planning services for the forthcoming year; drawing up budgets; and preparing budgets to include grants for the voluntary organisations? All the decisions of the shadow authorities will be vital.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right—I am glad that I gave way to him. Of course, there will be planning for the future. The hon. Member for Linlithgow asked whether the £23 million estimate had changed because there are an extra two authorities. It would be fair to say that that estimate has probably increased, pro rata, to £24 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is saying that £24 million has been set aside to deal with 30 authorities, which is roughly £800,000 for each authority. Is that enough to pay the salaries of the staff who will be appointed by those shadow authorities? Every director of every department will be appointed in that year, so is that sum enough to pay all those salaries?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman quoted salaries for local authority employees, and members of the Committee were taken aback—we were making rapid calculations about how the standard of living of the average director exceeded anyone else's in this Room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These will be planning authorities and we envisage a chief executive and a director of personnel as the first key people to be appointed. They certainly do not need to appoint directors for every function. In the first month or so, the new shadow authorities will require an immediate grant or borrowing consent. Thereafter, we would
	<span class='label label-info column'>838</span>
anticipate the submission of detailed expenditure proposals from each shadow authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members have asked how that £23 million or so will be distributed. Clearly, it is impossible to answer that question at present. The circumstances will vary considerably between, for example, Fife—if it is confirmed as a unitary authority—and the present Strathclyde regional council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw the Minister's attention to a point raised by Donald Adams of Central region, who said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The difficulty for the Scottish Office is to come up with a fair way to distribute grant in a very short timescale. The view is that, at the moment, the Government have not given much thought how they will do this. Added to this problem is the fact that Central Government now provides 88 per cent. of local authority expenditure and that any variation will be potentially quite dramatic in council tax bills.'</p></blockquote>
I am referring simply to the time scale.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will appreciate that we have indicated clearly the scenario for 1995–96. The shadow authorities will not be delivering services in their first year—they will be planning bodies. There will be plenty of time before GRE distribution proposals for the following year. Those distribution decisions are always complicated and involve a great deal of work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members referred to capping, but that is not an issue for the shadow authorities. They will be financed 100 per cent. either by a grant or borrowing consent, authorised by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State with the Treasury's consent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This clause is limited in itself. I cannot accept the amendments for the reasons that I explained earlier. I hope that my explanation of how the system will work has been helpful to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a serious matter. The Minister may ask why it refers to £196 million. The clause refers to transitionary expenditure for one financial year and he has already given an indication of the costs. It might have been more appropriate if the amendment had referred to £23 million as the Minister would have had to explain that that £23 million was his first guess. Earlier, he suggested that it might be £24 million—he added an extra £1 million "just like that", as Tommy Cooper would have said. It was pulled out of the hat like a rabbit. That is another £1 million that will be taken from some other part of expenditure. It may come off the expenditure of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton), who has responsibility for education. Important matters such as special education or nursery schools may lose out. That £1 million may be taken from expenditure on other vital aspects of the work of local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We tabled the amendment, which refers to £196 million, as a probing amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the hon. Gentleman say that it was a probing amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I was using an English word—probing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested because at the start of our proceedings the hon. Member for Hamilton disapproved of probing amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is my hon. Friend's upbringing. He is a delicate and shy person who is not used to such forceful words, which can sometimes be misinterpreted. With my more open background and more risque upbringing, I can use that language.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to interrupt this fertile flow, but I have special insight into the mind of the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Knapman). He was making an abstruse reference to the Maastricht ratification process when I moved hundreds of probing amendments and, by withdrawing them at the appropriate moment each time, I managed to frustrate the hon. Gentleman on every occasion. It is clear that, a year later, he is still suffering from that frustration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>840</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have heard that there was much probing in Maastricht, but I did not realise that there was so much withdrawal. Later I shall quote from an interesting letter to my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) from the Outer Isles Presbytery of the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland. You can really look forward to that, Sir James.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Serious questions must be asked about the transitional costs. I accept that the clause deals with one year and with loans and grants. As my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East suggested, local authorities can make money from charges. That is a worrying shot across the bow. If there is a shortfall in the money available to local authorities through the council tax, the revenue support grant, or loans, we have the frightening prospect of substantial increases in charges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Secretary of State give detailed evidence about the transitional costs? Earlier, I cast doubt on the Touche Ross report, which I think that the Minister has accepted is now discredited. The Secretary of State has advisers, a finance department and much expertise in the Scottish Office. Can we have details and evidence to support the Government's assertions on transitional costs? First, how is it envisaged that transitional costs for staff will range between £42 million and £83 million? I said earlier that those costs would be much more than that estimate because of people being unwilling to relocate in different areas, retiring earlier than expected and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, how can the estimate of between £25 million and £40 million for winding up transitional costs be justified? Does that take into account the problems of computers and information technology? Does it take into account the points about property which I raised earlier? The property costs are greatly underestimated. Even when there were to be only 10 replacement councils in Strathclyde, huge costs were estimated for creating those new departments to deal with regional services in Strathclyde. There are now to be 12 councils in Strathclyde, which is a substantial increase. Have the Government taken account of that increase?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, how can the figure of £23 million for the shadow authorities be justified, especially in the fight of the devastating speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East, who went through the documents fine by line in challenging the Department's costs? The figure is now up to £24 million, but how can that be maintained?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the Minister did not deal with the amendment about the Treasury. What undertakings has the Secretary of State given to the Treasury on funding the costs of the proposed reorganisation, especially as transitional costs will not be offset by continuing savings? We must know about that. We are getting into a financial black hole. The Department has not taken into account many costs in the estimates. I hope that the Minister will give us a detailed explanation today. That is the purpose of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have sat through almost every minute of the financial debates on clauses 24 and 25. One after another my hon. Friends have challenged the Minister, but in return he has not justified the expenditure. He has asserted what the costs will be, but has given no justification. He has banks of well qualified officials here and elsewhere who can argue the case and tell him how the figures are calculated and why my challenge to the Touche Ross report is wrong, if it is wrong. The Minister has given no assurances about costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0470">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>841</span>
We are already worried about the devastating effect that the cost of reorganisation will have on the direct provision of services for the needy and the vulnerable. If the Government's figures are grossly underestimated, our worries are multiplied. I am pleading with the Secretary of State to give an explanation to the Committee and, through that, to let people outside know the basis for the calculations. The Government must tell local authorities, COSLA and other people what is involved so that they can understand what they face. I hope that the Minister can give us some explanation this evening. The Committee deserves nothing less.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I return to an earlier point. The clause deals with not transitional costs in general, but the costs incurred for one year by the shadow authorities, which will not deliver services or give grants to organisations. As they will not deliver services, there is not much for which they can actually charge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Earlier, the Minister admitted that the authorities were drawing up budgets for when they take over. Therefore, they are making decisions that will determine whether there will be charges or whether the services will be provided free.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not in any way disputing that. The key point is that the shadow authorities will be planning bodies for a year. They will not be taking council tax decisions, providing services or making grants to voluntary or other organisations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Earlier my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley referred to the questions that Chas Gray had asked. May I repeat one of them, which has not been answered? Will the Secretary of State provide the Committee with copies of the submissions that support the level of the overall ongoing savings and transitional costs as set out in the financial memorandum to the Bill? The answer is either yes or no. Submissions will or will not be offered to us next week. What will happen?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee accepts that the hon. Gentleman properly attended another meeting earlier in our debate. I must inform the hon. Gentleman that the Scottish Office received the letter only yesterday and I have not had the opportunity to study it. It will be properly replied to in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that I was making to the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley was that we are dealing essentially with the administration costs of the shadow authorities that will be planning the future budgets and strategies of the new authorities. We shall provide pump-priming finance. We then anticipate the submission of detailed expenditure proposals from each shadow authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figure of £23 million is clearly an estimate at this stage. There are some detailed questions on the appointment of staff that the staff commission will have to work out. I accept that they are probing amendments, but the figure of £196 million is based on a misapprehension of the nature of the clause. Presumably,
	<span class='label label-info column'>842</span>
it is a reference to overall cost, but that is not what the clause deals with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am about to sit down. The hon. Gentleman will be able to speak then if he wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause deals solely with the costs of the shadow authorities, which will cover their planning functions for the year in which they are not delivering services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely what bothers me, and increasingly so. The Minister has said that he received the questions from Chas Gray only yesterday. That is as may be. If they were complicated, arcane or convoluted questions, I would understand that the Minister would want a week or more to answer them. In fact, they are straightforward questions. God help us if such questions are not easily answered. Ken McKay is sitting there so surely—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member is not allowed to refer to civil servants sitting in the Committee Room.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am getting very steamed up about this, but I shall make my remarks impersonal. What the Minister has said is that the civil service cannot answer the simplest questions. I am blaming not civil servants but the Minister. He has key civil servants with him, so it should be possible to answer those straightforward questions. If they are not answered, that is further proof of how ill-thought-out the Bill is. It is the most ill-thought-out Bill that I have known in my 31 years as a Member of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 323, in page 22, line 4, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"it shall not be necessary for the local assessor to" and insert "shall not".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 328, in clause 28, page 24, line 1, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"it shall not be necessary for the assessor to" and insert "shall not".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are probing amendments and I make no apology for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the rating valuation rolls are put together, there should be no allowance for the fact that there may be a full-scale revaluation. Amendments No. 323 and 328 delete the words "shall not be necessary". The amendments would provide that the valuation "shall not" take place. It is important that everyone is clear that there will not be an attempt at full-scale revaluation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, the valuation lists are set by the ten assessor departments. Later, we shall debate whether there should be only ten assessor departments. The Bill started out with the intention of having 28 unitary authorities; we now have 30. There is also the Lanarkshire-3 proposal, which has been rumoured in the press, and that would make the figure 31. If we go to the insane stage of having the three-way split in Central—I am sure that the Minister is slowly, but surely getting fed up with that—we would have 32.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend not aware that many amendments are likely to be moved on Report by hon. Members representing Highland constituencies. If some of them are accepted, we shall have a substantial number of small authorities there. There is also the suggestion that Dumfries and Galloway may be broken up, so there are many other possibilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That prospect fill me with some dread. We are already beginning to realise from our debates on the finance provisions that the cost of disaggregation is the thing that we must fear. We do not necessarily guarantee people better services or any feeling of being closer to those services if we cannot deliver them of a certain quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is to give some assurances to the authorities that there will be a period in which assessor departments will be properly set up and that there will be no full-scale devaluation. Valuation lists frighten people. In Scotland, it was felt that valuation bandings were inappropriate anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The poll tax was designed to take the weight off such people as the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), the Minister of State, Department of Employment, who lives in a substantial mansion beside Loch Katrine, and to put it on folk in the middle income bracket, in middle-class housing. We know—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The Minister says that he lives in a middle-class house. It is dastardly of the hon. Member for Stirling to shift the burden of responsibility for local services on to the back of his hon. Friend the Minister, especially as band A carries a disproportionate amount of the burden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the local assessor was able to revalue before the revaluation list was produced, there would be fear and trepidation among people in the lower band that, given the burden that will fall on local authorities—we know
	<span class='label label-info column'>844</span>
that there will be either a council tax hike or a service cut—any increase in council tax might end up on a revalued list. That new valuation roll could put some properties into the higher bands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I took the trouble to look into some of the examples that were given to the Committee. North Lanark was mentioned. That authority estimated that band D, the median band, would raise £89,000 for a £ 1 yield of council tax. The authority gave that estimate as the valuation rolls now stand. We want valuation rolls put in place without any threat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I am ultra-suspicious or cynical. What does the phrase "with any necessary modifications" mean? It conjures up a host of opportunities for the Government to act by order, or by manipulation, which is their style. Does my hon. Friend share my cynicism?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I doubt that we could be accused of cynicism, but we now react automatically to phrases in the Bill that suggest that the Minister could change his mind, or initiate unforeseen change in valuation rolls, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Angus, East spoke of the Secretary of State's fall-back powers in an earlier clause to intervene in a way that none of us thought would be possible until the time appointed in the forthcoming Act. We tabled the amendment to persuade the Minister to be more firm and state what will not happen. If he cannot, what is he trying to hide, or tell us?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 31, 32 or 33 new authorities may of course have new assessment departments. I do not know how carried away the Minister will be between now and Report with all the divisions of Scottish local authorities. We could end up with massive revaluations, which would cause considerable distress to people who think that they should be in lower bands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obviously concerned to hear the word "revaluation". My hon. Friends know that there was absolute terror among Conservative voters, and Conservative Members of Parliament and councillors, during the last revaluation. A historically significant point of which my hon. Friend knows is that that stramash was the forerunner of the poll tax—and we know what happened through that revaluation crisis that the Conservatives brought upon themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend made a good point. It is important that we probe the Minister because there are phrases in the clause that could allow any eventuality, which I am sure the Government would not want to have similar consequences. They lost many seats in the 1992 elections because people felt betrayed on such questions as rating valuation and local taxation, just as they have discovered since then that they can be betrayed on rating valuation and national income taxation. There is little left that the Government are not prepared to do. Therefore we have reason to be suspicious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Estimates of the cost of transition that Strathclyde region gave suggest that there could be an extra £327 in band D simply to pay for breaking up Strathclyde. That is frightening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0472">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>845</span>
COSLA gives the latest figures in its press release:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The report also predicted as a result of the costs, increases in council tax estimated at between £230 and £440 on a Band D property if the costs were met in one year".</p></blockquote>
The Minister knows that they will not be met in one year. If they were met over five years the increase would be £60 to £100 on band D, which is the median. If most people shifted into that band, it would impact heavily on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned that the Government will not allow the revaluation process a free rein. The Minister must give us clear assurances about our amendment. He would be well advised to signal now to people in private and public housing in Scotland that there is no question of this happening
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central spoke about the impact of revaluation in England and Wales. In Scotland, revaluation is a statutory requirement; it must take place every five years. That has saved us from some of the traumas that may yet be experienced in England and Wales, which I believe have not had a revaluation for a decade.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While we are on the subject, my hon. Friend may be interested to hear that Celtic has just been sold to McCann and Dempsey. I feel that this great news should be imparted to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Strangely enough, there is a tenuous link between that information and our discussion. I am sure that Parkhead's valuation will increase considerably and that, when it moves to Cambuslang, Glasgow city, sadly, will lose the revenue that would come from the non-domestic rate on the new stadium at Cambuslang. That is very sad for the people of Glasgow. Given the renewed interest in Celtic, I am sure that people will be willing to pay increased ticket prices whatever non-domestic rate is set for the club.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment takes account of the fact that the Local Government Act 1992 will still be in force and that revaluation for adjustments to the roll will be allowed for such properties as a new Cambuslang stadium, or an addition to Parkhead, if Celtic decides to stay there. What we do not want is a continuing blanket revaluation process. We want the valuation roll to remain as it is now set, so that at least one star will shine as brightly in the sky and people will know how the valuation roll estimates their properties. When the Government's proposals are enacted, at least people will know that only one parameter—the Government's miscalculation, or lack of funding for the re-organisation, not the revaluation roll—has been changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I will give one further example, because the Minister should be made to realise how a revaluation can affect people. He may know that Callander, where a revaluation took place and which is situated in the area represented by his hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, currently part of Stirling district and part of Central Region, is considered highly attractive to people setting up tourist facilities such as bed and breakfast, and to those choosing a place to live. Some revaluations in Callander trebled on that last occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was no question in people's minds but that that revaluation was improper. The rating system, rather like council tax banding, is based on the concept of real value
	<span class='label label-info column'>846</span>
of property; beforehand it was based on imputed rentals. People wanting to rent their property would not have been able to match the rateable value estimated in the revaluation. They were shocked. Similarly, a revaluation now, on the council tax basis of the capital, or market value of a property, would probably have the same effect. The impression would be that the properties would be extremely lucrative if they were put on the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stirling put his mansion on the market recently when he was involved in a libel action. Were there many takers at the sort of value that people would like to see their properties sold at? That is the process by which properties are valued at present. We want some reassurances from the Minister that there will be no truck with revaluations. We want the Government to withdraw their phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"it shall not be necessary"</p></blockquote>
and replace it with the phrase, "it shall not happen". There should be no revaluations and no threats to people's properties. The Government should back down now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I promised Iain Hay of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors of Scotland that I would ask just one question. It concerns authority valuation areas and the appointment of assessors. The RICS believes that notwithstanding the wording of the first two lines of clause 26(6), the use of the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"it shall not be necessary"</p></blockquote>
on the fourth line appears to allow some discretion to the new assessor to revalue property if he disagrees with his predecessor's valuation. That is clearly not intended, and the RICS suggests that some strengthening of the wording may be necessary. Those comments also apply where the same wording appears in clause 28(5). I simply ask for a Government comment on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, may I turn to the general points made by the hon. Member for Falkirk, East? The last revaluation was not exactly popular in Newton Mearns or Giffhock either, never mind Dunblane. I listened to the hon. Gentleman's speech with a great deal of sympathy, therefore. I hope that I can reassure him on these points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause allows the new council tax valuation lists for each of the new local authority areas to be formed out of existing lists without ordering a revaluation. The words highlighted in amendment No. 320 are necessary to enable existing provisions that tie the preparation of new lists to the introduction of the council tax on 1 April 1993 to be set aside, while retaining all provisions of continuing relevance. Applied to that process are the provisions of section 84 of the 1922 Act, which relates to compilation and maintenance of valuation lists. That section was drafted specifically in relation to the first compilation of those lists on 1 April 1993.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is intended that the bulk of the section should continue to apply to the technical exercise of restructuring the valuation lists to coincide with the new authority boundaries, although some minor modifications such as the references in that section to 1 April 1993 will clearly be needed. Amendment No. 320 would prevent such modifications from being made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that this sounds technical, but people outside the Committee will read it too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Falkirk, East made it clear that his principal concern on amendments Nos. 323 and 328
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0473">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>847</span>
was to ensure that a revaluation will not be carried out as part of the process of recompiling valuation lists. He has my total support on that general theme. I can reassure him that the amendments are unnecessary because the clause as worded has precisely that intention. No change in the drafting is therefore necessary. The assessor has no power to revalue property simply for the purpose of making an entry relating to that property in a new list or roll.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to the hon. Member for Linlithgow, clause 26(6) requires the assessor to compile the new list by a process of extrapolation from existing lists. It does not allow the assessor the discretion to revalue. No doubt the technical experts to whom he has referred and those in the Scottish Office can be in touch to confirm the details, but that is the excellent advice that I have received on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that Iain Hay will be contacted about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is fairly technical so it has mostly gone over my head. If we could slow it down somewhat it would help to convince me that the Minister's assurance can be taken at face value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the purpose of the clause is to ensure that there is a valuation list for each new local authority area which is to be compiled by the local assessor and which is to come into effect by 1 April 1996. It will therefore have to be compiled before that date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister explain exactly who the local assessor will be? The present local assessor is employed by Tayside regional council and his department is part of Tayside regional council. Under the proposals in the Bill, that council will no longer exist after 1 April 1996. We must assume that the local assessor referred to in the Bill is not the present assessor in the Tayside area. New assessors will be appointed to the successor authorities in Dundee, Perth and Kinross and Angus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will those be entirely new appointments? Will those successor authorities be able to appoint anyone to those positions? Or will the existing staff in Tayside regional council simply transfer across to the new authorities and act as the assessors in this instance? If so, who will fulfil their function in Tayside regional council as they switch across to the shadow authorities in the transition period?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There could be a by-election in Tayside at some point in that year. I do not wish any ill on the hon. Member for Tayside, North or indeed the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir N. Fairbairn) but they could snuff it next year and so could I. An assessor and electoral registration officer would need to be in place to conduct that election. If he has already gone off to the shadow authority, who will be left in his place to conduct by-elections?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an important principle that needs to be established by the Minister. He has ducked and weaved around it tonight. The shadow authorities will draw up the new valuation lists. Shadow assessors will have been appointed and they will be given the job of extrapolating from the existing valuation list for Tayside region three new lists for Dundee, Perth and Kinross and Angus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who will carry out the day-to-day administration and functions of the assessor's office in Tayside regional
	<span class='label label-info column'>848</span>
council up to the point when it is disestablished in 1996? It is not clear to me, and the Minister has not made it clear to the Committee, how the shadow authorities and the existing councils will be able to operate side by side. Which officers will be attached to the existing councils and which will be attached to the shadow authorities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister explain exactly who these local assessors will be who will work in the shadow authorities, drawing up the new valuation lists for the new authorities which will come into being on 1 April 1996?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key amendment in this group is amendment No. 323.1 say that because it is the only one for which I have been given a briefing. As I understand it—	<i>[Laughter.]</i>—or should I say, "It says here"? The amendment has been suggested by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in Scotland. Its members feel that the wording of subsection (6) provides too much discretion to the new assessor to revalue property if he—or she—disagrees with his—or her—predecessor's valuations. If we are to be reselected, we must be very careful about our language. 	<i>[Laughter.]</i> The RICS believes that that degree of discretion is not intended and suggests strengthening the wording.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has in fact agreed, at least in principle, that a revaluation cannot be carried out and that it must simply be extrapolated from the existing valuation. The Minister said that it was his intention that such revaluations should not take place, but there is nothing in subsection (6) to prevent the assessors from carrying out a revaluation if they so choose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valid point about revaluation, but even that might appear quite draconian.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is vital. My fears are based on the position in Dundee. As the Minister knows, the boundary changes that are proposed for Dundee—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said earlier that I regarded the amendments as unnecessary, and I gave the Committee an assurance to that effect. If it will help Opposition Members, as I am sure it will, I am prepared not only to give assurances but to tell the hon. Gentleman that I am, in the interests of helpfulness, prepared to accept amendments Nos. 323 and 328 at the appropriate point in our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What a day this has been.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 321, in page 21, line 35, leave out "reasonably".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 322, in page 21, line 38, leave out "reasonably".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is another probing amendment, in the best spirit of probing—a one-word amendment. The Government are saying in the clause:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As soon as reasonably practicable after compiling a valuation list under subsection (1) above, the local assessor shall send a copy of the list to the council for whose area the list was compiled"</p></blockquote>
We are arguing that we should delete the word "reasonably" because, once again, this should err on the side of the recipient—the council. The council faces a dilemma in that period of delay, not knowing exactly what values list it will be working to. We are arguing that, in the best interests of civil servants, and considering the difficulties and practicalities of getting a list together, the Secretary of State should not give more leeway to the assessors' office than we would like. Again, the key decision might come when discussions are held on whether there should be 10 assessors' offices, or 31, 32 or 33—in other words, whether every local authority should have its own. People in positions that they wish to safeguard might argue very logically that they cannot possibly do that without more staff and everything else that is involved. What is a reasonable delay?

I am sure that we can all recall dealing with bureaucracies. I am thinking of the setting up of the independent living fund, the setting up of the payments board for the disability living allowance. We were told that there was a backlog of 10,000 and if someone applied for an increase in their disability living allowance, it was only reasonable to expect a delay of about six months, and that those responsible were trying to do their best.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the sort of thing that will happen if we add too many subsections and adjectives regarding what is reasonably practicable and what is not reasonably practicable. It is very important to stick to the simple term, which is that as soon as practicable, the list will be available to the councils. In that way, we do not give any hostages to fortune. We have tabled this probing amendment so that the Government could explain what they thought they meant when they drafted the words "reasonably practicable". Why did they not just put "practicable"? They seem to be gilding the lily of caution by providing that there should be two descriptors for what would be a reasonable or practicable time.

I shall quote again the example of a band D median pound of council tax in the North Lanarkshire authority, into which Monklands district council will be subsumed. I was born in Coatbridge, by the way, which is part of Monklands district.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

A valuation of £89,000 in band D would be expected by the new North Lanarkshire district council, or unitary council, or whatever it will be called. If there was a delay in the council receiving the valuation list, there might be a delay in sending out the council tax demands to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>850</span>
320,000 new people in the council's area. We know what happens when there are delays in sending out council tax demands. Many of us have had to deal with someone saying, "It's the council's fault, they didn't send out the demand early enough." But then the council says that the person did not return the appropriate form at the right time, or explain how it would be paid—in one lump sum, by 10 standing orders or by 10 direct debit payments. Then it gets into the hands of the sheriff's officer. Sir James, you might not have sheriff's officers in the part of the United Kingdom where you live, but we have had to face the terrible prospect of people who are trying to sort out their finances when a technicality—a delay—means that the matter is put in the hands of the sheriff's officer. It is no good that person saying to the regional council, "It is all down to a delay on your part. You didn't send out the demand early enough. I didn't budget for it properly. I had to make three payments to catch up, and I couldn't afford it out of my family budget." They do not want to know about that. They just want to get the money in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard earlier from Conservative Members about the money still missing from Strathclyde for the poll tax. That was all down to delay—unnecessary delay. In this case, we want nothing to delay the process of sending valuation lists out to local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may be able to indicate, as he did earlier, that he will accept certain amendments because they make sense. They make it clear to those who are waiting and will be waiting for those valuation lists to begin the process of working out how much the council tax banding will be and how they should proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would the North Lanarkshire authority get that valuation of £89,000, or would the valuation be altered in some other way? Would the valuation list show that the authority would have to increase or decrease its council tax? It will be a mammoth task in that authority alone to draw together Cumbernauld, Monklands and Motherwell districts, to put the services into operation without having any delay, and knowing what the valuation list had been working on and in which districts certain properties fall. I hope that the Minister will give us some assurances or we shall have to debate the wording and what is meant by "reasonably practicable".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is tailor made for me to comment on it. There is no one more reasonable in argument than me in Parliament, let alone the Committee. Conservative Members accept that. Both in and outside Committee, hon. Members have commented on my speeches, "That was reasonably good—do try harder". I always wonder why the valuation lists are published on 1 April. It leads to interesting speculation: whose leg is being pulled about valuation? Some strange valuations are made. Let us consider two houses. One is a council house that is owned by the council. The other is privately-owned, but is otherwise exactly the same: it has the same number of rooms; the windows are in the same place; no additions, extensions or improvements have been made to it.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are dealing with the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As soon as reasonably practicable after compiling a valuation list under subsection (1)",</p></blockquote>
but need to discuss the new assessors, who will compile the valuation lists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, the assessor department for my area is Tayside, which no doubt has existing valuation lists that could easily be adapted to form the new valuation lists. However, because there are district councils in the Dundee area, the valuation list will probably be district council-based. There will be a Dundee district council valuation list, a Perth and Kinross district council valuation list and an Angus district council valuation list, but the boundaries will change that. Members of the Committee must understand that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposals take such areas as Invergowrie and Monifieth out of Dundee. The same is true of Birkhill cemetery, but it will not have to be assessed for the purpose of council tax as its inhabitants will not be liable to pay it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A significant difference will be made to the valuation list that will have to be made available for the new Dundee authority. The task is not easy. The new assessor will have to take considerable time to pull together the valuation list for the new Dundee authority. As I understand it, he will be employed by the new authority. Therefore, he has to do what it tells him. That is where the word "reasonably" comes in. I see that you are shaking your head, Sir James.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The assessor for the new Dundee authority will be employed by it. It will tell him that it wants a valuation list by a certain date. As an employee, he will have to produce the list by that date. Therefore, there is no need for the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As soon as reasonably practicable"</p></blockquote>
because it is not for the assessor to interpret what is reasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is ingenious, but the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley would think that I was discriminating against him if I did not call the hon. Member to order. He must address the exact terms of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You, Sir James, may not know the detail of the map that my hon. Friend described. If you did, you would know that my hon. Friend was talking about a situation in which there would be a Dundee assessor. At the moment, there are 10 assessors. They exist not on a district basis, but on a regional basis. The difference between what is "reasonably practicable" for a regional assessor with a disaggregated region and what is reasonable for an assessor working for Angus or for Dundee may be considerable. Is my hon. Friend as worried as I am that such leeway is given for delays in delivering the valuation list?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With all respect, my hon. Friend has made a valuable contribution that the Committee will have to consider carefully before making a decision about the amendment. I shall explain why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The assessor for the successor authority will work for the shadow authority, which will become a unitary authority after 1 April 1996. It will pay his wages, so why
	<span class='label label-info column'>854</span>
should it be limited in what it can do in instructing him to produce a valuation list? Why should the Bill state that he should produce a valuation list for the new authority only when it is "reasonably practicable"? Surely, the assessor could be told that the list is required three months in advance of 1 April 1996 because the council has to plan to provide services for the year and needs to know what the council tax base will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not for the assessor to say, "I'm sorry. I can't produce the list until 1 April 1996. The new authority will have to guess what the council tax will be after 1 April." Perhaps an assessor might think that it was unreasonable to provide it until that date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is estimated that Dundee is about to lose 11 per cent. of its council tax revenue base as a result of the boundary changes, but that will not be known until the valuation list is drawn up and studied. If an assessor tells a council that a valuation list cannot be produced until the last moment, how can it plan to provide services? Councils must see the valuation lists in advance of 1 April 1996.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I point out that the amendment would omit the word "reasonably"? It is quite clear, and refers to the phrase:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As soon as reasonably practicable".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member should explain to the Committee why the assessor instead should provide the list "as soon as practicable".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is important, but it is as narrow as that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Your explanation of the amendment is excellent, Sir James. I shall struggle on with my argument, as it is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Omitting the word "reasonably" from clause 26(3) would cause that subsection to read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As soon as practicable after compiling a valuation list under subsection (1) above, the local assessor shall send a copy of the list to the council".</p></blockquote>
There can be no argument about that. A valuation list cannot be sent to an authority until the list has been compiled. However, the word "reasonably" gives the assessor leeway to judge what is practicable. The assessor's employer cannot say—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. In law, it is not for the person to decide. The courts would decide what is reasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You have cast a whole new perspective on this previously narrow debate, Sir James. If the courts in Scotland have to decide what is reasonable practice on the part of the assessor, we shall enter a terrible minefield. If a council tells the assessor that it wants the valuation list three months in advance of 1 April 1996 and the assessor replies that that is unreasonable and that he cannot, in all reasonable practicality, produce the list before that date, the matter will have to go to the courts, which are famous for taking months or years to sort out such questions. It is possible that a council would not know what its own valuation list was when it came into being. Nor would the Government know on what to base that council's grant assessments. Local government would grind to a halt. This debate has taken on a very wide significance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There comes a time when the Chair must assert its authority. I am very reasonable,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0477">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>855</span>
unlike the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley. I must remind the Committee that the amendment is very narrow and concerns the word "reasonable". The hon. Member for Dundee, East can deploy some of the arguments that he has used at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall follow your advice closely, Sir James, and stick to the use of the words "reasonably" and "practicable". My point is related to the narrow issues raised by the amendment. What does the word "reasonably" refer to? Who decides what is "reasonably practicable"—the assessor, the new successor authority that employs him or her, the shadow authority, or the courts? The matter must be cleared up. The Committee must be aware of the significance of the word "reasonably" when it is interpreted in the real world by people who must implement the measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see that the Minister is agreeing with me, or perhaps he is laughing at me. It is an important matter. Who decides what is
	<br><blockquote><p>"As soon as reasonably practicable"?</p></blockquote>
Will the assessor, the unitary authority or the shadow authority decide whether it is unreasonable to expect a valuation list to be produced by a particular date? We need to know that because it is significant. Authorities will need the valuation lists well in advance of 1 April 1996, because they will not be able to plan the provision of services in their areas until they know what revenue they will receive from the council tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that in the year preceding 1 April 1996 councils will appoint chief executives: shadow councils will have chief executives, finance officers and directors of social services and education. How can they draw up a budget if they do not have access to a valuation list? How can they get such access unless we give assessors enough scope to know when to make valuation lists available to successor authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the linchpin of the Bill. If the shadow authority were trying to do what the clause asks it to do, and an existing authority decided to adopt a policy of non co-operation, would it be reasonable for the valuer to use other means to obtain that information?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point. Tayside regional council is pursuing a policy of non co-operation with the Government on the implementation of the Bill. Whether the assessor is working for the shadow authority or is still employed by Tayside regional council, he has to get access to the valuation list, which is in the possession of Tayside regional council. If the council's elected members were to say to their officers, "Don't make the existing valuation list available to the new assessor and the new shadow authority," the assessor would have to say to the shadow authority, "I cannot in all reasonableness produce a valuation list by the date that you have stipulated, because I cannot get the co-operation of Tayside regional council." What would the Minister do?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman tell us whether his colleague, the hon. Member for

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because of the narrowness of the debate, hon. Members are introducing an element of levity into our proceedings. This matter is deadly serious. We are trying to ensure that when the successor authorities are set up, they have sufficient time to plan the provision of services in their area. They will not be able to do that unless they can guarantee that a valuation list will be made available to them by the assessor appointed under the powers in the clause. We must ensure that the clause does not give the assessor leeway, powers and scope to frustrate the councils' attempts to plan services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the local assessor shall send a copy of the list to the council for whose area the list was compiled; and the council shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, deposit it at their principal office."</p></blockquote>
There will be enormous interest in the new valuation list. Following the introduction of the council tax, there were thousands of appeals against the rate bands that people have been put in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am astonished at my hon. Friend's ability to keep in fine with an amendment which, on the face of it, seems a little narrow and technical. My hon. Friend has shown that if we are to take the legislation seriously, everything in the Bill must be properly scrutinised. Does the Minister agree that after the debacle of clauses 24 and 25, we must ensure that the provisions in the Bill are right for this place and right for the officers and the people who may be subjected to their deficiencies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to make a serious point. The existing councils are responsible for valuations and for placing properties in the appropriate band, and they are in the middle of dealing with thousands of appeals against those decisions. When the regional councils cease to exist on 1 April 1996, who will be responsible for dealing with outstanding appeals? Will the successor councils make the valuation list immediately available to the public so that those who want to appeal against the band in which their property has been placed will have access to that list as soon as is practicable and not as soon as is reasonably practicable, as stated in the clause? A council that wanted to frustrate the appeals lodged against it could say, "It is unreasonable to produce the valuation list in our principal office where the public can see it by 1 April 1996, because it is too technical, and we need another year." During that year it would receive council tax revenue from people who should not be paying it at that level.

The Minister should justify including the word "reasonably" in subsection (3).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In Scotland, electoral registration officers and valuation officers have traditionally been free from any political influence. That has been essential to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0478">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>857</span>
their job. It is often said that the current authorities are merely their paymasters and not their political masters. How can a shadow authority decide what is reasonable without considering the political aspect? That would break with tradition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The electoral registration officers are the assessors. The assessors referred to in subsection (3) are independent of councils to the extent that they exercise their own judgment. They are not in the same position as a paid, direct employee, who can be instructed by the council. If a council wants to close down a school, it can instruct the director of education to close it down and he will have to do so whether or not he thinks that that is a sound judgment. He is employed by a council taking a political decision. Councils cannot instruct assessors in the same way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have listened patiently and I hate to interrupt any hon. Member, but the amendment is quite clear. It refers to the local assessor and whether he should send a copy as soon as is reasonably practicable, as in the clause. The amendment would leave out the word "reasonably". It is a question of whether he could use reasonable excuse or whether he must do it right away. It is a narrow question of when the assessor should make the list available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is one small point, in addition to that magnificent explanation that you have just given the Committee, Sir James. The word "reasonably" is used twice in subsection (3), and there are two amendments, both of which would remove that word. You have dealt with the first "reasonably" expertly and excellently, Sir James. But there is a second "reasonably", which applies to the council's judgment of whether it should make the valuation list available to the public by placing it in its principal office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The interesting point is the reference to the principal office. I am not sure whether my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East covered that point. As you rightly said, Sir James, when the list is made available is crucial and germane to my hon. Friend's point. But we need to know what constitutes the principal office. I should be grateful for guidance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal first with the point I was making before my hon. Friend made that intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two different stages. The assessor may decide that he can reasonably produce the valuation list for the council by a given date. The council, for its own reasons, could decide that it would not be reasonable to pass the valuation list on to the people in its area by placing it in one of the principal offices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend is right. In the case of the Angus, where is the principal office? Will it be Forfar—a headquarters town? If so, how will people who live in Kerriemuir and Monifieth get access to the valuation list? Is it reasonable to expect them to travel to Forfar to see it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The word "reasonable" applies not to such a person travelling but to the local assessor. It is a question of whether the local assessor must act without any choice or leeway, and of whether he has a
	<span class='label label-info column'>858</span>
reasonable excuse for delay. That is wrong actually, but I have said it now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This will be a difficult speech to make because as my hon. Friends know I am a party loyalist and I always go along with the party line. However, on this occasion, I think that my hon. Friends are being completely unreasonable. I oppose the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been spending day after day and hour after hour trying to persuade the Minister to be reasonable. My hon. Friend the Whip will report me to the leader of the party for this. The Bill requires the assessor to conduct this important business reasonably expeditiously. My hon. Friends oppose that. They have not made a good case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to ask what the term "reasonable" applies to. Is it the delivery of the valuation list to the council? Or should the valuation itself be reasonable? Our constituents are worried about the matter and I have received correspondence about appeals against the bandings. Is the idea that a reasonable copy be made?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend made a point that did not occur to me. He is right that the phrase "reasonably practicable" refers not to the delivery of the valuation list, but to sending a copy of the list. Whether the list arrives or is delivered is not mentioned. As long as it is put in the post or given to Group 4, the assessor fulfils part of the statutory requirement. There will therefore be no need to ensure that the list is delivered to the council. The council may not even get sight of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a worrying thought. We have established that we are dealing with the delivery of the list. [HON. MEMBERS: "The sending."] The Minister must deal with the point, because if the council does not receive the valuation list, everything falls apart. It cannot proceed to set or collect council tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Atkinson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I might be able to assist the hon. Gentleman. Clause 26(3) states that the council has to deposit the list as soon as reasonably prcticable. If the council posted it—and it was lost in the post—that would be caught by the second half of this subsection, in the sense that the council would not be able to deposit it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the council does not have the document, it cannot possibly deposit it. First of all the list must get from the assessor to the council. When the council has it, it is required by the second part of the subsection to deposit it in a public office so that everybody can queue up to see the entries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The question is quite simple and I repeat it. The subsection states,
	<br><blockquote><p>"the local assessor shall send a copy".</p></blockquote>
That is not in question. We are considering whether the requirements of the subsection should be fulfilled
	<br><blockquote><p>"as soon as reasonably practicable"</p></blockquote>
or "as soon as practicable". That is all that should interest the Committee at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. The Opposition have probed with the amendment and they are now telling us about making deposits. Is not it time
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0479">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>859</span>
that it was withdrawn so that we can all get on to the next business?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not for me to decide, but for the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are talking about sending the list. We do not know when it will arrive. That was the point that the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) made. The next stage cannot be fulfilled if the list has not arrived.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is a question of sending. The hon. Gentleman knows that that is the only duty imposed by the subsection. Whether the list arrives or not is not in question. That is another matter that would, perhaps, arise under another amendment. Once the assessor has sent the list he has fulfilled bis duty. We are concerned about whether he should do that "as soon as practicable" or whether he will have a degree of leeway—more time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Sir James, and also to the hon. Member for Hexham, for drawing that important consideration to our attention. Perhaps I was wrong and perhaps I should have supported my hon. Friends. In view of the possibility that has emerged of the valuation list's being lost in the post, the purpose of the clause could be defeated. Perhaps my hon. Friends are right and the word "reasonable" should be deleted, as it would allow dangerous leeway.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not the case that only what is practicable is reasonable and only what is reasonable is practicable? Therefore, is not the word "reasonable" redundant? It would be better if the Minister intervened and accepted the amendments, so that we could get on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has anticipated my next sentence. In view of all that has been said so far the word does appear to be redundant. Perhaps, as soon as practicable, the assessor could be required to convey—and that, rather than "send", should be the word used in the Bill—the list to the council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We cannot debate what is not on the amendment paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The trouble is the weasel word "reasonable". I have discovered that it is a weasel word, giving leeway that should not exist. If the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"as soon as reasonably practicable"</p></blockquote>
remains in the Bill, the local assessor might send the list, by putting it in the post, handing it over to Group 4 or giving it to a message boy, on Hogmanay. It might take a long time to arrive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We all love Hogmanay, but it does not matter when the assessor sends the list, as long as he sends it. We are debating whether action is taken "as soon as practicable" or
	<br><blockquote><p>"as soon as reasonably practicable"</p></blockquote>
not how the list is sent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So as soon as reasonably practicable the assessor has to get it into a letter box. He
	<span class='label label-info column'>860</span>
must find a letter box that is big enough to take it On balance, having listened to both sides of the argument and explored it further, I am eternally grateful to the hon. Member for Hexham, for drawing our attention to the important point that the word "reasonably" is risky and allows too much leeway. Assessors sometimes do not finish their job as quickly as they should, as many of our constituents are finding out just now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend think it either reasonable or practicable to post a valuation list of thousands of properties, which must be a fairly big document? Surely the method of sending it is relevant to the question whether it is reasonably or practicable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The words under consideration are not "reasonable" and "practicable". The Committee is deciding between the words "reasonably practicable" and "practicable". There is a difference between that matter and the terminology used by the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know that it would be practicable to get a valuation list on reams of paper into a letter box, but I suspect that high tech is involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It could be faxed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give up. I support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The scope of the debate has been very important. Of course there are two different amendments before us. Amendment No. 322 is the one dealing with the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"the council shall, as soon as reasonably practicable".</p></blockquote>
I think that your ruling, Sir James, was important, because it is a question of when. Also very important was the contribution made by the hon. Member for Dundee, East who talked about the possibilities of these matters ending up in court. When a law is passed, its purpose is often to define quite clearly how it should be interpreted in the courts. If it is to be a matter of what is practicable, there will be a solid piece of ground on which legal and also technical experts can give evidence. However, on reaching the ground of the word "reasonably", often a subjective assessment of what is reasonable is required. We argue that the word "reasonably" should be taken out, because it leaves open a "Bleak House" scenario, where all the arguments are about the phonetics and the interpretation of the words, rather than about a practical, logical assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 322 relates to the part of the subsection that states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the council shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, deposit it at their principal office."</p></blockquote>
I clearly recall our debate on clause 25 and transitional arrangements. Their funding was the subject of great debate. We argued that the question of office accommodation would be judged by whether the Secretary of State and the Treasury allowed councils such things as offices. That is important if we are discussing what is reasonably practicable. If a council argued that it could not deposit the list and therefore that people could not see it or challenge it, because there was no office accommodation—and that it was reasonably practicable
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0480">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>861</span>
not to be able to do that, because it was the Government's fault that not enough money was provided—it would be in a minefield and a legal battle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We had better get out of this minefield. The hon. Gentleman knows that we are dealing with the single issue of the local assessor sending a copy "as soon as practicable" or
	<br><blockquote><p>"as soon as reasonably practicable".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take that point. I am trying to keep closely to that, Sir James. I have in mind litigation that is ongoing in my own constituency. Everything is down to the argument by the council about substantial loss that someone has suffered over a waiver of feu. That is a very important technicality in Scotland. The feu holder can refuse, for example, someone who has built an extension for business purposes, the right to use it, because the waiver of feu was not applied for. Alternatively, it might have been applied for, but the council might take a long time to deliver judgment on it. It is possible to argue that there are reasonable delays on the part of the council. It could not find the deeds: the Tayside register could not provide the correct information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1990, someone built an extension which he cannot use today because the waiver of feu for which he applied has not yet been decided by the council. Some would say that it was practicable for the council to grant that to the person who applied. The council would argue that it was not reasonable for the person to expect it to be granted to him. The proposal is a minefield in which people will lose the thread of the valuation argument because the council will say that it could not be deposited because although it was practicable to do so, it was not reasonable. It was therefore not reasonably practicable. Putting those two together means that the council has an escape clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone dealing with the council who finds that he has made a mistake will discover that the statement "reasonably practicable" is what the council wants. It wants to be able to say, "Yes, it may have been practicable but it was not reasonably practicable. You are asking for too much."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendment were accepted and the word "reasonably" removed, it would be a clear matter of judgment. A lawyer could then use the waiver of feu argument and say that it was possible to get these things at such and such a time—the Minister with responsibility for education in Scotland, who is an advocate, is listening intently because he knows that this is the head of a pin on which he is arguing—and substantial fees will be paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Someone who has a problem with his council tax payment could say that it arose because the council did not deposit the information at its principal office. The council could state that it was not reasonably practicable to do so. They could hire a QC or an advocate such as the Minister, when he was practising, to argue the case. The penalty for anyone who gets into trouble with council tax can be substantial. Every time a sheriff officer is sent to investigate a person's bank or building society account it adds £40 to the council tax. People come to my surgery complaining that the sheriff's office fees are higher than the original council tax.

My opposite number on the Tory Benches, the Conservative Whip, has brought in extra supplies of water for his hon. Friends. It seems to be particularly refreshing water, as all his hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timothy Kirkhope (Lords Commissioner to the Treasury)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to speak, as I usually remain silent, but I used some of my hard-earned resources to provide extra refreshment.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Sir James. I used an example because I have laboured in the field of the case of waiver of feu and I knew that one can get deeply entrenched in an argument between a council and an individual about what is practicable and what is reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would remove the caveat of the word "reasonably" and leave the word "practicable". I genuinely suspect that litigation will arise. The valuation list that should be compiled by 1 April 1996 may not be dispatched because of the problems of disaggregating the regions, which at present are responsible for the process. Or, the argument may be about whether it was practicable for the assessors—of whom there may be 10 or 30 or more, depending on the number of divisions of the regions—to put those valuation fists in the hands of the local authorities. Removal of the word "reasonably" would restrict the courts to a debate of the word "practicable".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0481">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>863</span>
Councils too will be involved in the debate about practicability. Anybody involved in litigation—a council lawyer or private lawyer working for the council on the Stirling or Kyle and Carrick model, or a lawyer for the litigant against the council—will be much more effective with a clause that only uses the word "practicable" and not the word "reasonably".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We argue that there should not be too many caveats, subclasses and subcategories in the Bill. I do not know why the word "reasonably" is included. Perhaps the Minister will tell the Committee what the reason is and why the legal minds in his Department did not tell him, "Stick to things that can be argued in court. That makes sense. Don't stick to things that must be argued on a subjective basis. That doesn't make sense."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note the supportive nods of the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West. Our task is to ensure that the Bill does not contain dangerous black holes that people could fall into. Deletion of the word "reasonably" would render the clause sensible; retention of it invites litigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is very important that we stick to the timescale. That matter will be argued by all hon. Members' constituents—apart from the constituents of hon. Members from England, who do not give tuppence about what is happening in Scotland but who are kept here for other reasons. But the people that Scottish hon. Members represent probably will find themselves spiked on the question of the timescale. People who argue that they did not get their notices in time will be told that that was because it was not reasonably practicable to deposit them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) raises another important point. My experience of local government taught me that bureaucrats do a tremendous job but that they can be a bit tetchy. That means that a discussion of what is reasonably practicable in the distribution of any material—in this case, valuation lists—could cause major problems. I am sure that my hon. Friend will agree that the establishment of authorities such as Kyle and Carrick, which are fanatical about privatisation, will mean that the quality of service may be diminished. As a consequence, the question of what is reasonably practicable would take on a significance that has not been considered this evening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is that, if the clause is left unaltered, it is quite frightening to think about what will happen in Kyle and Carrick, which is about to get a Spanish contractor to clean its streets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman must not go down that street.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure you, Sir James, that I shall not go down that street, cleaned or not. We do not know whether Kyle and Carrick will be given the duty to take over from the regional assessor and set up an assessor's office for south Ayrshire, as I think that it will be called. If that is put out to private tender and it is won by a valuer from outwith Kyle and Carrick, the question of what is reasonably practicable becomes a nightmare. What is reasonably practicable for a Spanish assessor's firm if items are posted from Spain? We all know what the post
	<span class='label label-info column'>864</span>
is like in Spain. Has any hon. Member ever sent a postcard from Spain? It is Christmas before the summer holiday postcards arrive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I continue to be astonished at the reservoirs of brilliant ideas that my hon. Friend comes up with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happens if the valuations companies are privatised? That raises the issue to a wholly new plain of consideration, which had not occurred to me. My hon. Friend will comment further, but if we have a privatised service in an authority such as Kyle and Carrick, the notion of reasonably practicable takes on a significance well beyond anything that I have heard from Opposition Members this evening—their comments have been excellent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: During consideration of the Bankruptcy (Scotland) Bill and the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Bill, my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar)—a lawyer—was the shadow Secretary of State for Scotland and sat on the Labour Front Bench. He is now trying to sort out the social security system, of which the Government have made an absolute shambles. During consideration of those Bills, my hon. Friend always picked on words—I often wondered why he, as a lawyer, did that; he often made a more intense debate out of small phrases and words than out of whole clauses. As a lawyer, he knew the sort of trap that can be fallen into.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Genuinely not knowing what the assessor's office will be and what will be practicable for that office will be difficult enough; what will be reasonably practicable for an office of an enabling authority which has achieved the aim by some other means? Until now, I had not thought that we were discussing what is reasonably practicable for anything other than a public office—I did not include privatised services. What is reasonably practicable for a privatised service is worse than anything that we have talked about until now. The Minister must realise that he is pushing the enabling authority, which we do not think will work. That enabling authority will not save staff unless it gets rid of staff, including the assessor's department, and puts them out to private tender.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we remove "reasonably", we can at least argue in the courts about what is practicable, even for a privatised company. But what is reasonably practicable? It is like watching a fruit machine as the advocate's bill rings up in the council offices. Individuals will try to fight the council because some disaster had befallen them because they do not have their council tax list and do not know what to pay. We must remember that the valuation contains non-domestic rates too. Companies such as BP, which pay millions to local authorities every year, might find that their assessment is missing because it was not reasonably practicable. Let us get down to practicalities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We want to hear from the Minister whether in this context there is a possibility that they could be employed on contract or could be a private firm of valuers, or whether there is any restriction in the Bill that would prevent the assessor service being put out to the private sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are talking about the existing local assessors employed by the existing authorities. They would not be employed by shadow authorities. They would simply transfer to the new authorities. Before any hon. Friend asks me about that, that is the next clause in the Bill, which we shall no doubt be discussing at about 11 o'clock tomorrow morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his clarification that the assessors will continue to work for the regional councils. Does that mean that the assessors'
	<span class='label label-info column'>866</span>
department in Tayside regional council will be responsible for making up three separate valuation lists—one for Dundee, one for Angus and one for Perth and Kinross.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is correct. The assessors draw up the list and pass it to each of the new authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall repeat for the record, Sir James, what you have reminded Opposition Members of on several occasions, which is what we are talking about here. The local assessor is required to send a copy of the valuation list to the relevant council, and the council is required to deposit it at its principal office, in both instances as soon as reasonably practicable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I am simply stating the facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would delete "reasonably". The hon. Member for Falkirk, East referred to a black hole and terrible consequences if the amendment were not accepted. The word is in existing legislation and has created no problems whatever.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Angus, East has not yet contributed to the debate, I am happy to give way to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain why two words were used—"reasonably practicable"? Was it for reasons of legal definition? The words do not make sense in ordinary speech and either one or the other would have sufficed. If something is to be reasonably practicable, the Government must have some idea of what is unreasonably practicable. That does not make sense. Why were two words used when one would have sufficed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a pertinent point and I shall respond to it in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall reply to one of the genuine points made by Opposition Members on the statutory duties of the assessors. The clause enforces a statutory duty on the local assessor—the point was raised by the hon. Member for Dundee, East—so that he is not subject to any pressure from his employer to hasten or to delay unreasonably the sending of the list. He has a statutory duty and if the question arose of what is reasonably practicable, that would be determined by the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, Central asked me to give way and I am happy to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to get this clear because, like my hon. Friends, I am not an expert in valuation, which may be obvious. If the valuation fists are prepared by the existing authorities—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I should record the arrival of the water, Sir James, and our thanks for your inspiration in asking the Whip to provide it.

If the valuation fists are prepared by the existing authorities, will the new assessors be able to challenge what is being transferred to them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I dealt with that when discussing the previous amendment in reply to a question from the hon. Member for Linlithgow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. If the Conservative Whip has a carry-out under the Table, we would be grateful to participate at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The justification for the words "reasonably practicable" rather than "practicable" is that "practicable" is a more rigorous requirement. Clearly it could be practicable to deliver a list, but unreasonable to do so. It might be practicable to deliver it at 3 o'clock in the morning by making people work overtime, but that would not be reasonable. It would be reasonably practicable to deliver the list the following morning. That is a good example to show why "reasonably" should be included.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the Minister agree that common sense, whether in Government, in Opposition or in local government, would suffice? The phrase "reasonably practicable" is extraordinary when common sense would always err on the side of what is practicable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not disagree with the hon. Gentleman. I would hope that common sense would prevail in these matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. On a day when the Celtic board has been forced to resign, there is cause for celebration. Would it be in order to celebrate by bringing in alcoholic beverages to the Committee Room?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Nobody is allowed to bring alcohol into the Committee Room. I have seen no sign of alcohol, but if any hon. Member is hiding alcohol, he can distribute it only when the Committee ends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My train of thought is being interrupted by the constant points of order about refreshment for members of the Committee. We are not far from the 12 o'clock break that you announced, Sir James.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing whether it would be sensible to have the more limited term "practicable", which is clearly more rigorous, or whether it should be qualified by "reasonably", as in the proposed legislation. I emphasise that there is nothing unusual or new about the phrase. It has not been challenged in existing legislation and it has created no problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a recipe for common sense, which was referred to by the hon. Member for Fife, Central. The hon. Member for East Lothian had a short period of rebellion before wiser counsels prevailed. He was given a couple of looks by his formidable Whip, the hon. Member for Paisley, South (Mr. McMaster) and he came back into fine. Nevertheless, we on the Conservative Benches were grateful for that moment or two of rebellion. It shows that he has a free and independent spirit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened to lengthy speeches from the Opposition, and I conclude that common sense suggests that to qualify "practicable" by the word "reasonably" is sensible. It is in present legislation. What is practicable is not necessarily reasonable. For example, sending documents in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>868</span>
middle of the night may be practicable but not reasonable. Although I have listened to the debate with the closest attention, I cannot, as a reasonable man, accept the amendment. I know that Opposition Members may push it to a Division when everyone has spoken to it, but I advise the Committee that, regrettably, I cannot accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that "reasonably practicable" may be in existing legislation and that it has caused no difficulties. A commonsense approach might cause no difficulties, but what does "reasonably" mean in the context of merit pay awards, payment by results and the possible contracting out of services? If services are contracted out and the firms that are employed are given clear targets, the nature of what is reasonable in those circumstances might well change. The Minister gave an example of delivering documents at 3 o'clock in the morning. I recognise that under existing legislation it might be deemed unreasonable to demand that documents are delivered at 3 o'clock in the morning. It would seem to be common sense to deliver them at 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock in the morning, whenever the building opened. If, however, the valuation is undertaken by independent contractors and there is a penalty clause if it is not submitted, for example, by 9 o'clock the next morning, it would clearly be unreasonable to expect them to wait until after 9 o'clock the next morning, when they might incur costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In such circumstances, "reasonable" might mean in a common sense way what it would not normally mean in a common sense way. To avoid confusion, therefore, it would be appropriate for us to consider the possibility of deleting "reasonably".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that there are various methods of merit pay and various ways of ensuring that contractors brought in by an enabling council get payment by results. I shall run through several of those in the next hour and a half. It is important to establish the general point about merit pay, as it has numerous advantages. The difficulty is that very often its results are not reasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not like to interrupt an hon. Member, but the amendment has nothing to do with merit pay. As I explained earlier, the question is whether an assessor should deliver a list
	<br><blockquote><p>"as soon as reasonably practicable"</p></blockquote>
or "as soon as practicable". That is the issue. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would wish to abide by the Chair's ruling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly would, Sir James. The question is what is reasonable in different circumstances. As I said, what might be reasonable and practicable in normal circumstances would change entirely if, for example, staff were operating on a commission basis or on a payment by results system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If enormous penalty clauses attach to a failure to deliver documents, say by 9 o'clock in the morning, means that in those circumstances it could be deemed reasonable for the contractors to demand that the building be opened at 3 am, so that the documents could be delivered before the 9 o'clock deadline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is common sense to the contractor might not be common sense to an objective person examining the situation. We must therefore explore the matter further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0484">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>869</span>
A relevant issue might be the scale of the penalties attached to the contract. It might be deemed reasonable for the contractor to demand that the building be opened to receive the documents if the penalty involved was £15,000 to £20,000. No reasonable contractor could be expected to give up the opportunity of avoiding a penalty of £15,000 to £20,000, if the only cost that would be incurred would be the cost of having a building opened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise, of course, that in those circumstances it would be reasonable for staff of the local authority involved to be called out to open the building at a particular time. If that were at 3 am, additional costs would be incurred, depending on how far the member of staff had to travel, whether public transport could be used or, if public transport was not available, whether taxis were required. That would incur additional costs. In my former authority, Strathclyde, there were frequent debates about whether it was reasonable to provide staff, especially female staff, with transport home at night. That issue should be examined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that context, the definition of "reasonable" raises other issues. The context in which the word is being examined has changed completely. The decisions depend on balancing the pluses and the minuses of the action that is proposed. Can the Minister assure us that merit pay or penalties for contractors will not be applied to the matter that we are discussing? If he can do that—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am being patient. We are discussing a simple matter. The statutes are studded with the phrase that we are considering. We are discussing whether the local assessor should send, and the council should deposit, the valuation list "as soon as practicable" or
	<br><blockquote><p>"as soon as reasonably practicable".</p></blockquote>
Legislation would never be enacted if we discussed all the ins and outs. The question is simple. I know that the hon. Member wishes to remain within the narrow confines of the amendment that his party has tabled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a question of "practicable" as qualified by "reasonably". I was trying, perhaps inadequately, to clarify how the changing nature of local government service could affect the way in which the phrase is defined. As I tried to show, perhaps inadequately, the considerable changes—through decentralisation and the concept of enabling authorities—in the way in which local government services operate, mean that different criteria are applied. You disagree, Sir James, but the matter is debatable. I am willing to debate it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concept of Spanish contractors being responsible for mailing notices has been discussed earlier. I do not wish to go over that again. There is often a delay when items are sent from Spain; there is not nearly such a long delay if they are sent from Holland. I am aware, through debates with colleagues in the Union of Communication Workers, that they are worried that a lot of postal work is going abroad. Is it reasonable for that work to be sent abroad at less cost only to take a longer time to arrive?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry but I must interrupt the hon. Member. If I did not do it now, I should be open to
	<span class='label label-info column'>870</span>
criticism from other hon. Members, next week, next month or two or three months hence. They could claim that I allowed a debate to go way beyond what is reasonable. I appeal to the hon. Member to restrict his remarks to whether the local assessor should send, and the council should deposit, the valuation list as soon as practicable or as soon as reasonably practicable. The other issues are not relevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The issue is obviously narrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Extremely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Your exposition, Sir James, was—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Much better than the Minister's.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. If I may say so, you explained it without the excellent civil service advice that the Minister has. It must be said that you had the benefit of the Clerk who sits beside you—one of the many excellent Clerks who have helped the Committee over a period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman should not refer to the Clerks. They are excellent and always helpful, but, like civil servants, hon. Members should not refer to them. They are there to assist us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member must not go over old ground. If he does, he will fall foul of another ruling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In those circumstances, I will quit while I am ahead and save my other remarks for later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed that we have not made any advance. The problem is that the Minister appeared to say that because we had words in previous statutes—that was the terminology used—we do not change them now. If the world was the same as before, we would be quite happy with that explanation. However, the problem is that things are not the same. Things have moved on and, according to the Minister, things will move on even further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are setting up legislation that will be used again and again for litigation. People will try to judge what we have said. However, the Minister has said that the measures have always been in the legislation so they should always stay there and that we should not think about tightening them up or being firmer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause does not fit in with Scottish law. That is based upon the idea that one challenges rulings and the courts set case law. That is how we get the adversarial system. The Minister is basically saying that he wants that adversarial territory to be added to the new local government territory, which we have been defining in terms of boundaries and duties. We have heard aspirations on how the new services will be delivered. We are leaving a minefield.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All we are trying to do is help the Minister out. He has disappointed all of us in not being able to accept that. I do not know how we can convince a Minister who has said that was correct in the past will be correct in the future. We will make no progress at all. It is a pity that the Minister has not seen good sense. However, it is clear
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0485">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>871</span>
that we will not get anywhere with the Minister. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 222, in page 21, line 40, after "of, insert "Borders,".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 223.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are consequential on the decision taken during our consideration of schedule 1 that the new Borders unitary authority should cover the same area as the existing regional council. The amendments ensure that there will be no requirement for fresh valuation lists or valuation rolls to be prepared on 1 April 1996 in cases in which there is no difference in area between an existing regional council and a new unitary authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister says no new valuation is to be drawn up, is he saying that no changes will be made in the various data banks that are operated by the assessors?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I said is that existing regional councils, such as what will become the new Borders, will automatically have up-to-date valuation lists on 1 April 1996.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is perhaps unfortunate that my hon. Friend the Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire is not with us at this historic moment because it is the first consequential amendment flowing from the important amendment to Schedule 1. We took the proposed new Berwickshire, Lothians and East Lothian local authorities out of Schedule 1 and unanimously reinstated Berwickshire as part of the Borders region. As a resident of the Borders region, I welcome that proposal and am grateful to the Minister and the rest of the Committee for the Government's important concession. I am a little disappointed that my Member of Parliament was not here to endorse that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I acknowledge that the amendment is concerned with the status quo valuation fists. Does my hon. Friend agree that, had there been any changes to the Borders, because of the Government's daft idea, it could have had significant effects on the valuation fists in that particular area and in East Lothian?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is self-evident because every valuation affecting the district of Berwickshire would have been taken out of the Borders and added to part of East Lothian to form a new valuation list with a new assessor. Costs would have been associated with that. My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow is right that technological problems would have arisen from the new list.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A moment ago, the Minister said that an up-to-date list had been compiled by the assessor in the Borders. But in a written answer on 7 February 1994, the Minister told me that there had been 2,996 appeals against council tax
	<span class='label label-info column'>872</span>
bandings in the Borders region, of which only 234 had been dealt with so far. Far from there being an up-to-date valuation list for the Borders, there are 2,742 outstanding appeals. The situation is infinitely worse in other parts of Scotland, in bigger regions with bigger lists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the important, consequential amendment, which reinstates the Borders, not least because it also reinstates East Lothian as an integral area, which will not be split.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With total respect to you, Sir James, I am finding it difficult to associate amendment No. 223 with the first one. It is not clear to me that it is absolutely consequential to the inclusion of the Borders in clause 26(4), although the Minister said that it was. Could the Minister explain?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 223 excludes the new Borders council from the requirement to provide the fresh valuation rule, as the first amendment exludes the new council from the requirement to draw up a fresh valuation list.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must have read something wrong. Amendment No. 323 is one of the two that we are debating—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 223.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am even more confused than I thought that I was. I welcome the fact that the Borders is reinstated. Clause 26(4) adds the Borders to the Dumfries, Galloway, Highland, Orkney Islands, Shetland Islands and Western Islands, which are all the existing local authority areas, with their own evaluationists and assessors. Therefore, there will be no transitional costs. Why is not Fife included because presumably it has its own assessor and valuation fists, so could have had the same treatment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This may or may not stir up the hon. Member for Fife, Central but there is a difference between the borders of the existing Fife regional council because of Kincardine. If Kincardine went back into Fife as has been suggested by Labour Members—there is no commitment to do that—the hon. Gentleman would be correct. Fife would be added to the list.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So this is Tulliallan parish again. When the people of Tulliallan parish and of Kincardine and Forth have their way and are returned to Fife, there will be a further consequential amendment to the clause and even more transitional costs will be saved. I welcome the fact that the Minister has saved significant transitional costs by reinstating the Borders. It would be interesting to know just how much has been saved. I suspect that the amount will be significant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The benefit of unscrambling the Borders valuation list and redistributing it between the late and unlamented East Lothian and Berwickshire local authority and the residuary Borders authority would have been significant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is correct. The fact that the new map does not cross regional boundaries—the previous map did—results in significant savings over and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0486">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>873</span>
above the original estimate. We have not been able to quantify them, but the hon. Gentleman is correct. There are savings as a consequence of changing to the new map.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are making real headway. That is the first time that we have managed to persuade the Minister to admit that significant savings will be made by maintaining existing regional boundaries. How often have my hon. Friends and I made that point? I welcome the admission in relation to the Borders. The Minister admitted that there is a significant saving. I hope that there will be further significant savings when Fife is restored in its entirety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Central, Ayrshire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree about Central, but Ayrshire is complicated because it is part of Strathclyde. However, there is scope for further savings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon. Friend the Minister will respond to this point. There should not be too much of a problem with Ayrshire because already there is a valuation role for the local authorities as they currently exist in district form. Given that the proposals for Ayrshire are based on the present district make-up, great cost will not be involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's premise is that there will be no problem with Ayrshire. However, it has a conspicuous problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: George Foulkes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It could be the hon. Member for Ayr, but the Committee is discussing the Borders, not Ayrshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Borders region contains slightly more than 100,000 people. It is moderately well represented by the absent hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire and the right hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Sir D. Steel). I do not understand why minority parties nominate an hon. Member to sit on a Committee when he is not prepared to take a full part in proceedings, but credit must be given to the hon. Member for Angus, East.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious about the amendment. It provides for Borders, as well as Dumfries and Galloway, Highland, Orkney Islands, Shetland Islands and Western Isles not having to produce a new valuation list because they will retain their borders. They have lists so a new list does not have to be provided by an assessor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about adding Borders because the matter is unresolved. It is very well for members of the Committee unanimously to agree that Berwickshire and East Lothian should be dropped and Borders reinstated. On Report, it will be possible for any hon. Member to submit an amendment that may be carried. There will be amendments that provide for the break-up of the Highlands authority. The Highlands authority may have to be taken out of the Bill. Amendments providing for the reinstatement of an all-Ayrshire authority may be carried. Ayrshire may have to be added to the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend suggests breathing new life into the moronic idea of splitting East Lothian in two and adding part of the Borders to create the monstrosity of Berwickshire and East Lothian. That is not and never has been an option. I should hate anyone to think that my hon. Friend is breathing new fife into it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at all. I am not trying to breathe new life into that monstrosity. I voted with my hon. Friend on that; the Committee was unanimous. I am a reasonable Member of Parliament, but not all Members of Parliament are reasonable and some may, for their own fiendish purposes, want the Borders to be broken up again. The Government may have the timing wrong on the amendment. Perhaps they should wait until the Bill is on Report, or until it is considered in the House of Lords. They should know the final shape of the new councils before altering subsection (4). We do not know what will be the shape of the authorities until the entire parliamentary process is complete.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be changes at any stage, so the Government are premature in saying that they know with certainty the shape of the councils, unless they intend to whip hon. Members, including the Ulster Unionists—I am sure that you would object to that, Sir James—through the Lobbies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman should not bring the Chair into the debate. I am not, in any event, an Ulster Unionist. The hon. Gentleman is trying to reopen a debate with which we have dealt already. I draw to his attention that the matter under discussion is that the Borders will not be required to draw up a new valuation roll.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly: I am questioning whether this is the correct moment for the amendment to be considered because the shape of the Borders council, and of Highland council or of any other council in subsection (4), has not been decided definitively. The Committee may have decided, but it is not the only part of the parliamentary process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assist the hon. Gentleman. The amendment deals with the Borders. If the Committee, or the House, decides that Borders should have a different size and shape, that will be dealt with. We are discussing whether the entity called the Borders, no matter what it may look like after the Bill becomes law—if it ever does—will not be required to draw up a new valuation roll.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand now that you are saying, Sir James, that the hours we spend in Committee are of no relevance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am doing my best to ensure that what is said in Committee is relevant. I hope that I am succeeding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are, Sir James. You may not be an Ulster Unionist, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South says, you are a popular Unionist. You are popular also for the skill that you have displayed in handling this technical and difficult debate in which hon. Members have continually veered away from the amendments and have had to be brought back into line.

	<span class='label label-info column'>875</span>
The Government may presume too much. Parliament has a certain independence. Some Conservative Members may be prepared to rebel against the Whips and make their own judgments about the shape of the new councils and, on Report, may be convinced that subsection (4) and the amendment to it on the Borders are not correct. I am not one of those because I agree 100 per cent. about the Borders, but, as you know Sir James, not all hon. Members in the south are as reasonable as I am.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. I wonder whether it is in order for an hon. Member to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"God forbid—these proposals get through the House, some people will say, 'I wish that Strathclyde was back again'."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 14 July 1993; Vol. 228, 	<i>c.</i> 1027.]</p></blockquote>
I seek your guidance, Sir James, because that was said by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Springburn (Mr. Martin). With your experience, Sir James, I wonder whether you realise what that means for the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Several Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a disgraceful attack on the co-Chairman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we approach the magic hour of midnight, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not upset the Chair. We have had a reasonably good atmosphere in Committee, as always.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. I wish to make it clear that the Opposition have absolute faith in the integrity of the joint-chairmanship of the Committee. We utterly deplore the attack on my hon. Friend the Member for Springburn that took place in Committee some minutes ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not realise that the hon. Member for Tayside, North was referring to my co-Chairman. It is utterly improper for an hon. Member to criticise the Chair. I deprecate what the hon. Member did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. I do not want to prolong the matter, but it should be put on the record that, on the date that the hon. Member for Tayside, North mentioned, my hon. Friend the Member for Springburn had not been appointed to the Chair of this Committee. I am sure that everyone would agree that since he has been appointed, he has behaved with absolute integrity and impartiality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. Surely if those remarks were known, it was an extraordinary choice to make as a Chairman of the Committee—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Obviously, the position was that the hon. Member for Springburn might be compromised after making those comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I resent what has just been said. In my opinion, my co-Chairman is a very honourable Member of the House of Commons. He is a very worthy member of the Chairmen's Panel and, so far as I know from reading the record of this Committee's proceedings, he has acted in the best traditions of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does not do the honour of the Committee or of Scotland any good by engaging in such remarks. I am sorry to think that proceedings are now deteriorating. I
	<span class='label label-info column'>876</span>
hope that the hon. Members for Stroud and for Tayside, North will withdraw their remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. I agree that Chairmen of the Committee should never be criticised publicly. I entirely agree with that. It was not my doing that the matter got into the public domain. I should never wish publicly to criticise any Chairman of any Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Member will now withdraw what he said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly withdraw any imputation that it may have been—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. We should not lose sight of three things. First, when the original criticism was made of my hon. Friend the Member for Springburn, the Opposition Front Bench invited the Minister to dissociate himself from it—and he did so, unequivocally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, another Conservative Member now joins in and criticises not only my hon. Friend the Member for Springburn but Madam Speaker for appointing him to the Chair. Moreover—I did not want to mention this—the hon. Member for Tayside, North said that it was not he who made the matter public. I was in the Committee Corridor when the hon. Member told the press that he was accusing my hon. Friend the Member for Springburn of being partisan. That is the worst criticism that can be made of the impartiality of the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we shall close the issue. I agree with the hon. Member's final point. I ask the hon. Member for Stroud to withdraw his remarks, and to do so briefly. When he does so, we shall proceed with further consideration of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of your guidance, Sir James, I withdraw the remarks. Equally, I hope that you will read the entry in 	<i>Hansard</i> to which my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North drew attention—	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us now finish this issue. We have established that my co-Chairman is a man of utter integrity as a Chairman of this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am deeply saddened by the advantage taken of the Committee by the hon. Member for Tayside, North. I was also in the Corridor and can confirm what my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South said—that the hon. Member for Tayside, North approached the press.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 midnight</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. You are aware that hon. Members seek the protection of the Chairman. When hon. Members repeat allegations that you have already put a stop to, the hon Member affected—in this instance, myself—has grounds for feeling that he is not receiving the Chair's attention, although I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0488">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>877</span>
accept that the Chairman's attention is often drawn in other directions. That is why criticisms should be made privately, not publicly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for Tayside, North, and nothing more needs to be said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If hon. Members have complaints about the occupant of the Chair, they can make them through the usual channels. This is an important Bill and my co-Chairman and I are doing our best to ensure that it receives proper consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it a separate point of order—nothing to do with the earlier one?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a separate point of order, Sir James.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Tayside, North said that such matters should be dealt with privately. On the "Scottish Lobby" television programme a couple of Saturdays ago, he said—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.1 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended.</i></p>
	<p>12.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now that we are refreshed, we should concentrate on the amendment at this early hour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend said that this was an early hour—it is not; it is a late hour. It is important to remember that because, to be strictly in order, it is not Friday—it may be Friday in other parts of the country, but in this Room, for as long as the Committee sits, it is Thursday. It is therefore late, not early. My hon. Friend must be careful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for reminding me of that. I should have remembered that outside in the Corridor it is Friday, but in here it is still the second sitting on Thursday. That is how it will be shown in 	<i>Hansard</i> at any rate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it is practically Friday? But is it reasonably practically Friday?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not go back into that. I thought that I convinced the Minister last time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point was well made that there is a lot to be said for just nodding the amendment through, with the addition of "Borders". The Minister suggested that the question of whether Kincardine should have been in Fife, which would allow Fife to be added to the list, will be decided. It is a great pity that the Minister was unable to tidy that up before we discussed the amendment. I am sure that he will, eventually, be carried by good sense, including the
	<span class='label label-info column'>878</span>
good sense of leaving Central region in one piece, so that it could also be added to the list. There are many options.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am somewhat reluctant to let this pass because we could have made so much more progress had the Minister been a sensible, listening and practical Minister, who saved money for the public purse. Fife and Central region would have been included, as well as Borders. It is a great pity that the Government have tabled such a limited amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to hon. Members for their support for the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to keep to the spirit of the important amendment. I am curious to discover whether the Minister or the Whip will make a statement about the disgraceful behaviour of two Conservative Members—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I gave my ruling on that and, in doing so, I endorsed the earlier ruling by my co-Chairman. In the circumstances, the matter should be left at that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that basis, I want to echo some of the sentiments about the omission of Fife. The Minister would have shown some good will had he inserted the Borders and Fife. No one in his right mind in Kincardine or, surely, in the Scottish Office, wants to steal Kincardine from Fife to set up Central region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept, as my hon. Friends made clear, that the Bill will create rather silly circumstances because the boundaries change daily and many areas are unresolved. We want to ensure that if Highland region, for example, is subject to further discussion, the Government will change the subsection at a later date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key question concerns the fact that the Bill states that subsection (1) will not apply. The authorities identified in subsection (4) will be old authorities as well as new ones. Are we to believe that the Government have tied the matter up properly? Surely, although subsection (1) may not apply to the assessors for the councils of Dumfries and Galloway, Highland, Orkney Island, Shetland Islands or Western Isles as existing authorities, if they become single-tier all-purpose authorities, will that change the context in which they could change the valuation lists, despite the fact that the Government have stated in the Bill that it will not?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a technical issue and we are trying to adhere to the excellent guidance that you have given the Committee, Sir James, but my hon. Friends were desperate for me to raise that point. It does not open up a new front on what is, ostensibly, a narrow amendment, but it highlights the fact that we are changing from old to new. Although subsection (1) does not apply to the old, in another guise, a unitary authority can do things which the Bill precludes it from doing. That hinges on the definition of old and new authorities. The Bill does not refer to single tiers, which is curious. I rest my simple case there. Clearly, there is much more to discuss. I am unsure of the dates because my hon. Friend the Minister for East Lothian has confused me. However, I hope that the Minister will clear that up. It is not a monumental issue, but it troubled me as I enjoyed my tea in the Members' Tea Room.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am the last person to want the hon. Member for Fife, Central to be troubled. The key point is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0489">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>879</span>
that there is no difference in area between an existing regional council and a new unitary authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take it from that brief response that, if the areas are to remain the same, no technical difficulty is created by subsection (4), which described the areas as part of the old councils, and subsection (1), which refers to each of the new local authority areas, although the Bill does not mention single tiers. If the Minister will assure me that that is right, I am sure that the Bill will not create complexities, if and when it becomes law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to give the hon. Gentleman that assurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment made.</i> No. 323, in page 22, line 4, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"it shall not be necessary for the local assessor to" and insert "shall not".—	<i>[Mr. McLeish.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed:</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause raises some interesting issues relating to valuation and rating. Several questions must be posed to the Government, one of which relates to rating relief. Valuation and rating are complex matters, which I do not suppose hon. Members know much about. We are always concerned when discretionary relief is provided to properties used by any organisation. Can the Minister confirm that rating relief already agreed for community centres, for example, will continue undisturbed by the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again this is not a monumental issue for such a hallowed place as the Palace and the Committee, but it is vital to voluntary organisations and others which use community centres. A few pounds can often mean the difference between an organisation or a centre existing or not existing. If an organisation were to worry about discretionary relief disappearing, that would not be good for its morale. We are seeking a comment from the Government on whether commitments made to, for example, Strathclyde, Lothian, Fife or Central, will be honoured and whether foolproof mechanism can be built into the system to give not only the assurance—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend mentioned that voluntary organisations receive rates or tax concessions. Does he believe that such concessions should also be extended to supporters' clubs? Does his question include sports clubs or voluntary organisations excluding sports clubs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an extremely valuable point. We use the phrase "voluntary organisations" as an umbrella term to describe many activities in the community. We are talking about existing commitments and about building in transition safeguards. We have a set of existing authorities dealing with rating and valuation, in which directors of finance and finance committees are involved. What will happen when we move from a figure of 12 to 30, 31 or 32? We do not know how many we will have. Therefore, we are seeking an indication that issues of this kind are being
	<span class='label label-info column'>880</span>
dealt with as part of the rating consequences of clause 26. At the end of the transition period, after 1996, clearly the new authorities will want to reappraise the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot cast to the winds all these vital organisations that use properties and could be the subject of rating relief. I accept that Opposition cannot give detailed recommendations, because we are not experts, but the issue should be looked at.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to the different aspects of rating, valuation lists are one thing, but what goes on behind a valuation list is crucial. A valuation list consists only of numbers, names and descriptions on paper. Strathclyde or Lothian, the bigger regions, give an enormous amount in relief to voluntary organisations, but that is not immediately obvious from the valuation list. The Government should be concerned in so far as this relates to the points made on clauses 24 and 25.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was struck by my hon. Friend's remark about valuation lists being important. As he will be aware, because of the poll tax many people in Scotland removed themselves from the valuation list. If they were suddenly to leave the valuation lists of the new authorities, would those authorities become responsible for chasing them up for non-payment of the poll tax under the old authorities? 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Ayr seems to be saying yes, that would be the case, but I should like to hear the Minister's views on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend can accept my views before we hear from the Minister. He has made an excellent point about the use to which valuation lists and electoral rolls are put. We live in a high-tech age when many organisations need to find out names, addresses and particularly financial details. My hon. Friend made an important point, because the legacy of the poll tax, the silliest, most stupid tax ever introduced, is still with us. I do not want to go down that road and have the relevance of my comments questioned by you, Sir James. Suffice to say in response to my hon. Friend, that this is an important matter, because the new authorities will look at the issues in a different way. We do not want statutory lists to be used again for political or financial ends, which may create more problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend opened up another possibility when he spoke about the valuation list being used for all kinds of purposes. If the assessor's department were privatised, it would be in the interests of a private company carrying out an assessor's duties to include commercial material and use the valuation list for purposes for which it should strictly not be used—not for council tax or electoral purposes but for sending out unsolicited advertisements, in order to make money from the valuation list.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I pay a compliment to the Minister; I would trust the Minister's judgment far more than that of Kyle and Carrick. The point that has been made is valid. My hon. Friend asked about privatisation. I expect that most authorities will be sane and sensible and will acknowledge the sensitivities of what we are doing. But when it is a matter of primary legislation, or indeed of secondary legislation through orders, surely the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0490">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>881</span>
community, often the beneficiary of discretionary relief, must be safeguarded. We cannot allow authorities to rampage through public services which have been built up over decades and which deal competently with valuation and rating, as provided for in clause 26.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend raises some excellent issues. I am sure that if he were to catch your eye, Sir James, a little later, he will want to expound on them, accepting that we are creating a statute with important valuation consequences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has just said that he wants central government control over local authorities. That seems to cut across everything that I have heard from the Labour party in recent times. I find it surprising, and I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman maintains his party card, as he makes such a statement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Staying within your rules of order, Sir James, I can confirm that my membership is paid up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How much does the hon. Gentleman pay?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot reveal those details, but if the Minister undergoes any trauma, he could phone Walworth Road and we could effect a speedy membership. But I suspect that that will not happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ayr referred to centralisation and local democracy. A number of important philosophical points have been raised, but I do not want to go far down that road. Suffice it to say that there must be checks and balances in any government structure. Some of the councils that may emerge from this new structure alarm me. That is why I made the generous comment that to have the Minister temporarily in the Scottish Office until we take over would be an important safeguard, not only to administer the mess that will clearly follow but, more importantly, to save the good people in certain parts of Scotland from some of the excesses that I foresee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the clause, what is the position regarding special schools in Scotland? We go quickly from discretionary relief, which could be 50 or 25 per cent.; it could be mandatory or discretionary. I believe that that applies to community centres. But when we come to exemptions, we are talking about serious money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be useful if my hon. Friend remembers that we are dealing here with current valuation lists, which have to be passed on to the new authorities to create new valuation lists. My hon. Friend may have noticed that later in the Bill changes are made to the legislation on the old basis of valuation. What is the point of handing over to the new authorities lists which will have been overtaken by provisions on the de-rating of sporting rights and such rubbish?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises an important point, which could occupy us for some time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to finish my initial contribution by saying that important issues to do with rating exist. We have highlighted descretionary relief, mandatory relief and fully exempted properties where valuable community activities take place. I hope that some of those issues will be considered by the Government because they matter to people; and the only relevance that the Committee and the House have is what they do for people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>882</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to introduce the subject of Labour party cards, but the hon. Member for Ayr asked about that. I have my card here and, if it were permissible, I could read out clause 4 to put it on the record—but I shall stick to clause 26 of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause covers the local assessor who will compile the valuation lists to be used by the new authorities. It was helpful of the Minister to explain during earlier debates that the assessor will continue to be the employee of the regional councils when he draws up the valuation lists.

The regional council assessor will draw up the valuation list for the new authorities. That will put the assessor in a difficult position. His wages will be paid by the regional councils and he will be expected to work for the new authorities in drawing up valuation lists for them. Additionally, the assessor will have to apply for a job with the new authorities. We must ask whether the assessor will be able to carry out all three activities at the same time. Will he be able to satisfy his employer—the regional council—while working for the new shadow authorities and applying to them for employment when they become the new unitary authorities after 1 April 1996? Conflicts of interest may arise.

A particular problem arises for the assessor in Tayside because he will work for three new shadow authorities while employed by Tayside regional council. There are bones of contention between the authorities. Angus and Dundee will be at war over Monifieth, so we cannot expect the assessor to satisfy Angus and Dundee, or Perth and Kinross, which may have its eyes on Invergowrie.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is entirely wrong. The assessor has those same responsibilities now. there is no change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman misses the point. There is no conflict of interest now because the assessor is working for one authority. There is no conflict between Tayside regional council, Dundee district council, Angus district council and Perth and Kinross. They are separate tiers of local government. Conservative Members make a mistake when they assume that we have a two-tier structure now. We have single-tier local government. Regional councils are totally responsible for their services and district councils are responsible for their services. There is no conflict between them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did I understand the hon. Gentleman to say that the regional assessor in Tayside is not independent in his decisions—that he makes decisions favouring the region because he works for the regional council and that he does not have problems because he is not employed by Perth and Kinross, Angus or Dundee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman cannot have been listening to me or he would not have made such a silly intervention, even at five to one in the morning. I appeal to the hon. Gentleman to listen to what I am saying. Of course the assessor is completely independent now and is in no sense influenced by the councils for which he works. He will be in a different position following the changes in the clause because he will continue to work for the regional council, but who will be his master? Will it be the regional council that he must try to please or the new shadow

authority with which he may want to find employment once it becomes the new unitary authority after 1 April 1996?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Assessors are human beings. No one is entirely independent. They cannot have the wisdom of Solomon and, at times, they must think about their own interests and those of their families. After all, if their wages are paid by the regional councils, they must have some loyalty to the regional councils. If a person applies for a job with Perth and Kinross, he will not want to upset anyone at Perth and Kinross while he is hoping to get that job. What will happen if that person applies for a job with Perth and Kinross and is knocked back? He may feel some resentment towards Perth and Kinross. He may use subsection (3), which we debated earlier. He will not be reasonable and practical with Perth and Kinross if it did not give him a job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would willingly accept a letter for the convenience of Ministers. I have given my brief to the Minister's officials and so I shall gabble through it. It straddles clauses 26 and 27. I shall deal first with the problems raised by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors.

Throughout the consultation process that preceded the Bill, the RICS strongly advocated the retention of the existing system of assessors. The RICS can, however, see no justification in increasing the number of assessors, given that the existing system functions well. The RICS notes that clause 27(7) enables the Secretary of State to establish a joint board of two or more valuation authorities. It is to be hoped that, in the interests of continuity, efficiency, cost-effectiveness and harmonisation, the Secretary of State will order that joint boards equating to the existing 10 areas be established. The RICS believes that any other action would be inappropriate given the time scale for the implementation of the Bill.

The second point was raised by John Cardwell, who is the distinguished new assessor of Lothian. He is concerned about subsection (3). He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At the present time the qualifications required to be possessed by any person appointed to the office of Assessor are contained within the terms of the Appointment of Assessor Scotland Regulations 1956. If it is intended that the required qualifications outlined within that Regulation be altered, would it be possible to indicate at this time what qualifications will be required for any person appointed to the office of Assessor by one of the new valuation authorities?"</p></blockquote>
COSLA suggested the following amendments. Clause 27(7) provides:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If it appears to the Secretary of State that any functions or any functions in any area, of two or more valuation authorities should be discharged jointly by those authorities, he may"—</p></blockquote>
and this is COSLA's suggested wording—
	<br><blockquote><p>"following consultation with those authorities, by order establish a joint board in accordance with this section."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>884</span>
Further on, COSLA suggests the following amendment to Clause 27(9)(b):
	<br><blockquote><p>"Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (8) above, an order under this section may include provision with respect to—matters relating to the membership of the joint board."</p></blockquote>
The suggested amendment is,
	<br><blockquote><p>"declaring that members of the joint board will be members of the authorities concerned."</p></blockquote>
COSLA states that there is no specific reference to the assessor's role as electoral registration officer and it proposes that the lacuna could be filled by the following words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There should be specific inclusion that the person appointed as Assessor should also hold the office of Electoral Registration Officer, which is current practice in Scotland. The existing provisions relating to the appointment of an ERO are contained in section 8(3) of the Representation of the People Act 1983 and as presently recorded could lead to different numbers of EROs and Assessors."</p></blockquote>
One o'clock in the morning is not the time for anyone to reach conclusions on such complex matters and, from my experience of dealing with assessors, I know who will get the better of it. Any Member of Parliament who tangles with assessors gets the worst of the argument. Nor would I do so. I have always found them to be extremely fair and meticulous people.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Linlithgow for suggesting that either we would return to most of the issues that he raised under clause 27 or, if not, that they could be dealt with in writing. His last point is more or less covered by amendment No. 324 which we will discuss under the next clause.

There were two points of particular substance. I assure the hon. Member for Dundee, East that the assessor is statutorily protected. The hon. Member for Fife, Central raised the issue of rating relief; where there is discretion will be for the new authorities to decide, as it is for existing authorities to decide from year to year. I assure the hon. Gentleman that clause 26 and the Bill as a whole make no difference on that issue.

With those—I hope—reassuring words, I commend clause 26 to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
