	<div class='title'>RECORDS HELD BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed [this day].</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall simply ask whether an answer is now available to the question that my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) and I asked about the unnamed civil servant's letter, of the reference and date that I mentioned this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There seems to be some confusion about the naming of civil servants. Perhaps I can assist the Committee by explaining that no one is present in Committee besides the members of the Committee and the Clerk. Therefore it would not be proper to refer to any of the civil servants or to the public. However, there is no breach of rule in mentioning a civil servant who happens not to be in the vicinity of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not mention the name of any civil servant in a malevolent way, except perhaps in relation to the controversial issue of the political adviser. A ruling is needed as to the status of the Secretary of State's political adviser. Some of us think that that gentleman is not a civil servant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As far as I understand the status of the political advisers whom the hon. Gentleman mentions, it is that of civil servants. I do not wish to enter the minefield of this subject. I am trying to help the hon. Gentleman and others, who seem to be afraid to mention civil servants by name. They need not be, so long as they do not mention civil servants who are present in Committee, or anyone who is in the Public Gallery.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If political advisers be civil servants, it follows that they must operate under the rules of the British civil service. That raises some fundamental questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Their status as civil servants has absolutely nothing to do with me. I have no say in their appointment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1354</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson (Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. As you appreciate, the Committee is making rapid progress—as, indeed, it has been doing for some weeks. It looks as if by late this evening we shall be close to or at clause 61. That clause begins part II of the Bill, entitled, "Water and Sewerage Reorganisation". Part II contains a series of Government proposals. Yet today, in a local government area that includes nearly half the population of Scotland, the result was announced of a referendum, decided by 71 per cent. of the people of that area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps when we reach the part of the Bill that deals with sewerage the hon. Gentleman can discuss that matter. It is not a matter for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. Given the size of the majority against the Government's proposals in clause 61 onwards, I genuinely thought that you would want to give the Minister an opportunity to withdraw the clauses in Committee or, at the very least, to make a statement saying that he would accept the Opposition's amendment, which faithfully reflects the wishes of the people of Strathclyde, expressed in a vote of 97 per cent. to less than 3 per cent. which has shocked the Government and their Back Benchers absolutely rigid. Deep down they want to make that statement and I hope, Mr. Martin, that you will give them the opportunity to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are on clause 52 stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we leave clause 52, may I say that the Minister was pregnant with speech in answer to my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall call the Minister when I think it necessary but other hon. Members want to come in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. The Government have said that one vote in the Council of Ministers in Europe is worth 6 million people and that one vote for Luxembourg is worth 200,000 but 1.2 million votes in Strathclyde are apparently worth nothing. This is Government of the selfish, by the selfish for the selfish. Could I through you, Mr. Martin, ask for a statement from the Minister on the Strathclyde referendum which makes nonsense of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Statements are normally made on the Floor of the House. The hon. Gentleman knows the procedure for ministerial statements. We are on clause 52.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Surely you, the Minister, or the Government Whip must have some power to adjourn the Committee. It is pointless to continue in the light of that referendum. This is a serious matter yet the Minister keeps on smiling and laughing. This affects the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and the future of millions. The Minister had better pay attention and be serious or he will get thrown out. This is a very serious matter, Mr. Martin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0751">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1355</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps I can reply to the very serious matter. The hon. Gentleman knows the rules of the House and the Committee. A motion for adjournment can be put and debated in Committee. It is not for me to adjourn the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the debate be now adjourned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am not prepared to accept that motion. I said that the hon. Gentleman could propose it: I did not say that I would accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was an excellent example of Catch 22 in Committee. I want to speak to clause 52. The Minister said that he believed the successor authorities could be relied upon to look after the records that were passed on to them with professional integrity. I am concerned that the latest evidence that has come before the Committee—the referendum result of Strathclyde regional council—will be part of the record that will be passed on to the successor authorities. I am particularly concerned about the successor authorities in Kyle and Carrick and in Eastwood. They may seek to destroy the evidence of this referendum and in particular the parts dealing with the Ayr division. Only 4 per cent. of the electorate in that division and only 4 per cent. in the Eastwood division supported the Government's proposals for the reform of water and sewerage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. When the hon. Gentleman said that he wanted to speak to clause 52 I relaxed a little. I now discover that he is back on the same subject as his hon. Friends. Clause 52 is about local authorities keeping records. He is stretching the point a little in discussing the referendum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The simple point that I am trying to make is that the results of the referendum are extremely embarrassing to Conservative Members and Conservative councillors in Scotland. If some of those councillors take hold of the successor authorities which replace the regional councils, including Strathclyde regional council, they will take possession of the results of the referendum. I want an assurance from the Minister that neither he nor any Conservative council in Scotland will be allowed to destroy the evidence produced by Strathclyde regional council that the Government's proposals for water are abhorred by 97 per cent. of people in the area who will insist, if the Committee does not, that the clauses following clause 61 should be excised from the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask several questions on this issue, especially as Strathclyde regional council has accrued very important records. Were the ballot papers stamped in a way that allows them to be validated? This is an important point in relation to records.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Sometimes important items cannot be debated at a particular time. This very important matter cannot be debated at the moment. We are debating the keeping of records under clause 52. The hon. Gentleman is speaking about the conduct of a ballot. That is not a matter which can be debated under clause 52.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1356</span>
I must abide by the Standing Orders of the Committee, which do not allow this matter to be debated at this stage in our proceedings. Members of the Committee may be able to debate it when we reach the provisions on water and sewerage. I understand that hon. Members are impatient to debate this, but the best way to do so is to dispose of clause 52 and move on to the appropriate clauses. I cannot see a way of allowing a full-blown debate on this matter under clause 52.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. In a spirit of generosity, I should like to come to the aid of the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie). With regard to the result of the referendum, that we received at lunch time today 	<i>—[Interruption.]</i> The Minister is trying to be the Chairman as well. I draw your attention, Mr. Martin, the information that all material relating to the ballot will be securely stored in-house for a period of 12 months. That would last until the first shadow elections, so the protection of records may provide a tenuous link between what the hon. Gentleman is saying and clause 52.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am ruling that under clause 52, we cannot debate the referendum. There are other ways of securing a debate on an issue. The hon. Gentleman is a member of the shadow Cabinet, so perhaps he can ask to have a debate on this. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> It is not unfair. I am under tremendous pressure to allow the matter to be debated now. I cannot, in all fairness, allow such a debate under clause 52.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As always, Conservative Members observe the words of the Chair, in the way that we deal with issues and in principle. On the basis of your ruling, Mr. Martin, I will resume my seat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Atkinson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who will pay for the storage of these records? Similarly, who paid the £750,000 that the survey cost?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is where we get into difficulties. I think that the hon. Gentleman has made his point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to finish my remarks, Mr. Martin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very well, but the hon. Gentleman should not respond to his hon. Friend's intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said, I always observe the rulings of the Chair. I trust that no other member of the Committee will dare to mention the referendum until we reach the appropriate provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to sweep up the points that have been raised in the debate. We spent a considerable time discussing the subject this morning. Keeping the historical archive in the custody
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0752">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1357</span>
of local authorities as well as contemporary papers, which local government requires to conduct its business and enable other to conduct theirs, is vital to the health of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause achieves two simple aims: it re-enacts the provisions of the 1973 Act and introduces new provisions to meet the request of the archivist profession in Scotland. It includes more detail about what is meant by "proper arrangements" and a new requirement for local authorities to consult the Keeper of the Records about arrangements for records. Beyond that, detail is properly left to local authorities. The profession believes that the clause is useful. The clause has the full support of the Keeper of the Records and local authority archivists in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are personal files included in the definition of "records" that is set out in subsection (6)? The wording refers to "other documents". The Access to Personal Files Act 1987 gives rights of access to individuals to their files. Will those rights be transferred to the new unitary authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should wait for the debate on clause 53, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A local authority may do anything which appears to them to be appropriate".</p></blockquote>
If other subjects, which are governed by existing legislation, found their way into the voluminous documents, there would be grounds for making a legitimate claim to the chief executive of the new council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some points are outstanding from this morning's discussion. First, an amendment will be tabled in due course to clarify that local authorities can fund inter-regional cultural bodies that are in more than one local authority area. That is totally different from the local authorities' records management function, which is the subject of the clause that we are discussing. We shall discuss the funding of inter-regional cultural bodies when the appropriate amendment is tabled. It is likely to relate to schedule 13, which is a minor, consequential amendment to other legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point is the keeper's attitude. As I have said, the keeper was involved in preparing the provision. He supports the clause. He and his staff are planning a programme, which will include close consultation with the existing and the shadow authorities to ensure that transitional arrangements operate as smoothly as possible. The programme also proposes close links with local authorities after the transition. He already has close working relations with local authority archivists in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, I was asked how we would ensure the effective operation of the transitional arrangements. The keeper will play a crucial role, for which the 1975 reorganisation did not statutorily provide. He will co-operate with Scottish Office officials about the two circulars that deal respectively with transitional arrangements and best practice for records management.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a straightforward question. What staff and budget resources has the Keeper of the Records
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1358</span>
with which to fulfil those tasks? He is being asked to undertake a fair bit of work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He has sufficient resources. His considerable staff will assist him and he has formulated plans on the basis of the measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I shall discuss the division of records for current regional councils. Most regional council records will be divided on geographical grounds. Successor local authorities will determine what should happen to the records that apply to the whole region, for example, the minutes of committee meetings. Such records could be held by one nominated successor authority, or jointly, in one shared archive. The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley nods his head. The records by which he decided the funds for the Rannoch community centre in my constituency—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Drumbrae.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Drumbrae, but it is now called the Rannoch centre. The hon. Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hughes) allocated the funds and he took them to another project. No doubt, the records will all be in the archives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When there is dispute during the transitional period, the Bill provides for the matter to be considered by a property commission as laid out in clause 19.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) that the keeper employs 125 staff. Therefore he has considerable assistance at his disposal. I am certain that he will use it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has failed to respond to an important point. I put the question to him more than four hours ago, so he should have had time to find the information for the reply, especially as it was promised in a letter of 31 January, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is the Government's intention to introduce a provision on cultural services"—</p></blockquote>
that includes provision for archives—
	<br><blockquote><p>"by amendment during the Committee stage of the Bill."</p></blockquote>
The Government undertook to consult hon. Members and people outside the House before the amendment was tabled. Where is the amendment? Will the Minister make a statement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already answered the hon. Gentleman I said that it is likely to be an amendment to schedule 13. It will be a minor and consequential amendment, and wholly separate from this clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I remind the Minister of the terms of the letter. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is intended that interested parties should have adequate notice of the terms of the amendment before it is considered in Committee."</p></blockquote>
Is that still the Government's intention? Will interested parties be consulted and be able to make representations to the Government and to members of the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to see the letter to which the hon. Gentleman refers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to detain the Committee, but I would like the Minister to clarify the issue of access to personal files. The clause deals with the use of records. Documents can include housing files, social work department files and the like. Local authorities should have the ability and the obligation to look after such files and to keep them in good order during the transition to the new structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the definition of records and documents include personal files held in housing or social work cases or other matters? Can the Minister assure us that existing authorities, which have adopted proper and open access policies to encourage citizens to gain access to their files to ensure that they are accurate and up to date, will be able to continue those policies in the new structure? Will the Bill give such protection and guarantees?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make one comment. Clause 53(3) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A local authority may—
	<ol>
	<li>acquire by way of purchase records which, or (in the case of a collection) the majority of which, appear to the authority to be of general or local interest;</li>
	<li>accept the gift of records which or, in the case of a collection, the majority of which appear to the authority to be of general or local interest."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
It is good that library and records services will be able to acquire documents that are
	<br><blockquote><p>"of general or local interest".</p></blockquote>
Conservative Members in particular and perhaps my hon. Friends would agree that one such document that should be placed under the control of the new South Ayrshire authority is "The View from Westminster" by the hon. Member for Ayr, which will be discussed at his constituency annual general meeting on Saturday. The hon. Gentleman states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The last year has had its ups and downs … the one area of Conservative failure in Government throughout the 80s was that of law and order … My greatest disappointment this year was my
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1360</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the hon. Gentleman has read the clause. It states that a local authority may acquire records which
	<br><blockquote><p>"appear to the authority to be of general or local interest."</p></blockquote>
The confessions of the hon. Member for Ayr of his and the Government's failures are of general and local interest. I am prepared to make them available to the record keeper of Kyle and Carrick so that they are available to future generations. That will be of great value to future generations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The document to which the hon. Gentleman refers has been prepared by my association for the use of its members. If its contents have become public knowledge, there is nothing to fear because the Conservative party is open in its affairs. The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, whose constituency annual general meeting was last Friday, would not have the courage to produce such a document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend think that now the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley has obtained the document, he might like to take things a stage further by joining the Conservative party and attending the AGM to appreciate my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Conservative party in Ayr is selective. I do not want to extend such an offer to the hon. Gentleman.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want you, Mr. Martin, and the Committee to know that when the document goes into the records of the new South Ayrshire authority, it will show that membership of the Conservative party in Ayr declined by 328 in the past year.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) asked whether the definition of records included personal files. It does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position relating to records in such a collection of files is that clause 53(2) governs that the Bill will allow nothing that would impinge on copyright or contravene the conditions under which records are held by authorities. I draw to the hon. Member's attention clause 52(1)(a) which provides for persons to have access where the authority considers that to be appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

of the political parties within their remit? If so, would my hon. Friend agree that in Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley the membership of the Labour party would be considerably below the membership of the Conservative party in Ayr?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I doubt whether that would be appropriate as the figures would fluctuate considerably from day to day and would be an unreliable guide.

The clause provides guidance on the proper use of records, bringing the position in Scotland into line with that in England. It makes it clear that an authority may permit people to inspect the records and to make copies. A local authority can publish or hold exhibitions of the records, subject to copyright, which would be of assistance. It also empowers the authorities to purchase or accept the deposit or gift of records which appear to be of general or local interest, as in England and Wales. Indeed, if my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr in future makes a memorable speech on a Burns supper night, the local authorities may purchase it, if they consider it to be of sufficient quality for their archives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This important clause has significant implications for the passage of this crazy Bill and also for the people who are likely to suffer as a consequence of its import.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My colleagues will be immensely cheered by the fact that they will be able to talk about water and sewerage in the context of the clause. The Government have been kind enough to table amendment No. 486 which refers to the new Strathclyde authority in relation to water and sewerage services and I hope that some of the points that we have found it difficult to discuss will be given an airing when we discuss that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 54 is likely to freeze activity at a crucial time in the economic recovery of Scotland. I want to read into the record what the notes on clauses say about the purpose and effect of the clause. They say:
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1362</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"This clause requires existing regional or district councils, from a date to be prescribed by the Secretary of State, to obtain the agreement of the relevant successor authorities, or in certain circumstances the Secretary of State, before entering into certain contracts or disposing of land above a specified value. A successor authority may, depending on the circumstances, be one or more of the new shadow councils or a new water and sewerage authority."</p></blockquote>
In a sense, the clause is easily understood. It means that the successor authorities must be consulted about a huge number of important land, building and other contractual agreements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have consistently argued that the Bill is a Bill too far. It is unwanted, expensive and unnecessary, and the people of Scotland feel very angry about certain parts of it. The referendum, to which we cannot refer, reinforces the arguments that we have made day in and day out in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from all that, there is a double burden. The business community in Scotland, the local authorities and the people of Scotland will find that clause 54 will allow the maximum amount of difficulties to ensue if the Bill is implemented. I cannot believe that the people of Scotland should see insult heaped upon injury by adherence to the conditions in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first group of amendments relates to the date on which the provisions in the clause will be activated. Later, we shall discuss the Government's amendments. Another group of amendments relates to the amounts specified by the Government before the trigger is activated, bringing in successor authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I wish to discuss the alternative date. We want to know what the Secretary of State will do with his power to specify the date on which the provisions will be implemented. The timing of that implementation could be disastrous. Briefing material from Strathclyde and from Lothian suggests that those councils are involved in a large number of contracts every year. Millions of pounds' worth of expenditure is involved, in goods that are traded in the private sector as well as between local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments require the Government to explain why the Secretary of State is seeking this power, on what date he intends to exercise it and, more importantly, what discussions with the business community have taken place. I suspect that the Government's half-baked proposals have been discussed with very few people. There is more to the matter than politicians attacking the Government: that can happen any day. But will the Minister say what discussions have been held with, for example, the chambers of commerce, the Confederation of British Industry, or the Federation of Small Businesses? What discussions have taken place in the constituencies of the Conservative Members who are helping to push through this ill-conceived clause?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer to all of those questions is that, basically, there have been no discussions. The business community will not know the impact of the clause until they get embroiled in the mess that it makes. It is another chicken and egg question: if we did not have this crazy Bill, would we need this clause? The Government are hell-bent on getting the Bill through and so need something to stabilise the transitional process. Why is that necessary? Why should the successor authorities be able to constrain work being done, contracts being let and land being sold? It has been suggested that tensions have already appeared in the planning relationships between districts
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0755">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1363</span>
and regions. Some planning authorities may be holding up decisions because they are looking ahead to the impact of the Bill. The Government must answer the questions about consultation: what, if any, consultations have taken place, and what has been the feedback?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second problem with the date concerns compulsory competitive tendering. The Scottish Office sent a letter dated 18 March to the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, in which the Government linked CCT in Scotland with the timetable of the Bill. The implementation and practice of CCT are very complex. The Scottish Office letter is fairly lengthy, and sets out the conditions in the transition phase governing the extension of CCT, which the Government are considering. It also discusses CCT in relation to existing activities, and examines CCT under the Local Government Planning and Land Act 1980.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An important point is made at the end of the letter which merely confuses further the already crisis-stricken timetable drawn up by the Government. Not content with producing a tiered approach to the future of CCT, the Government state in the letter that they intend to issue guidance notes for consultation with COSLA. The letter makes it clear that three months should be given for consultation on the draft guidance, and that COSLA, at the end of that period, may decide that it is appropriate to discuss the matter further with the Scottish Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in March now. If the consultation process starts in April, will the timetable for the Bill begin to unfold? There will be some tentative views about CCT in the offing and consultation will be held in the period after the Bill leaves this House and during the time that the Government begin to think seriously about how they can implement it. That is ludicrous. If the Government took seriously the mess that they have made they would scrap CCT, or call a moratorium on it. There would be no new extensions, and no changing of the dates of existing commitments to CCT or discussion of how they might be phased in after the transition process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For CCT to continue at a time when there is at worst a freeze and at best massive delays in contractual arrangements is a recipe for economic and social chaos in Scotland. Why have not the Government taken the sensible approach and told local authorities to put CCT aside at the end of an existing contract? It certainly has not fulfilled the Government's wild expectations about value for money and has resulted in massive numbers of excellent staff being kicked out of local authorities. Those with private sector jobs have had their wages slashed; their conditions have deteriorated and unacceptable employment conditions have been foisted upon them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is a moratorium, it must continue beyond the transition period. To judge from the letter, the Government are tackling the issue, but we need a clear, unequivocal commitment to take compulsory competitive tendering off the political agenda for a considerable time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are probing the issue of the relevant date and suggesting alternatives because we are anxious about the impact of the proposal on the big providers in Scotland. Strathclyde and Lothian were mentioned but we could
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1364</span>
equally have mentioned the other 10 regions and the 53 district councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government must face reality for a change. When the Bill is enacted, the Secretary of State will define the relevant date in an order. From that point there will have to be discussions between existing and successor authorities. Let us take police procurement in Strathclyde, for example. At present, Strathclyde regional council can decide on orders and contracts and then get on with it, buying from the private sector and generating employment and economic activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us think ahead to when this mess of a Bill is implemented. Strathclyde will have to speak to 12 successor police authorities because the board may be in the process of being established. There will be a Strathclyde police authority, 12 successor police authorities and the embryo for a joint board. The wide world outside in Strathclyde is waiting for orders, for jobs to be created and for work that local government does well to be started. What will happen? Who will do what in that mess? The Government will say, as usual, "Well, we hope that there will be a fair degree of co-operation and good will." But as I have said many times, the livelihood of employees, councils and the business community cannot be left on a wing and a prayer, or a hope and a prayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government simply are not addressing the issues; instead, there is a half-baked proposal that will inflict enormous hardship on the contractors involved. In respect of the police example, the Government must say how it will work for the benefit of the people of Strathclyde who are the recipients of the services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other reason for the alternative date is that we do not trust the Government. Every subsection of every clause in the Bill gives the Secretary of State enormous, in some cases draconian, powers to do what he wishes when he wishes by courtesy of the House—by resolution. If the Government and the Secretary of State have that power, we are entitled to have some idea of the likely date. The local authorities would certainly expect it, but we do not know whether a guidance note will be issued or whether it will go to COSLA and the local authorities. There will be many guidance notes to be discussed in the implementation of the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the first set of amendments, we are probing some serious issues. We have suggested a date to get a response from the Government. More particularly, the Government must specify a relevant date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall finish contentiously in my opening submission on the clause. My hon. Friends attempted, partly successfully and—due to your excellent chairmanship, Mr. Martin—partly unsuccessfully to raise an issue that concerns us. When we reach the Minister's amendment, we will discuss water and sewerage and Strathclyde. We are being sensible and generous in debate, and we do not need the sort of idle knockabout in which Conservative Members engage. A serious situation is developing in Strathclyde, where a population has spoken up. It expects the Committee to take its concern seriously. The Minister who will reply will probably be the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) whose constituency has participated honourably in the referendum. I hope that he will accept the seriousness of the matter. At the end of the day, we are talking about local government
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0756">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1365</span>
services, including police services, and the priceless, vital asset of water, which will be drawn into this mess.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will reassure us. More importantly, they might want to change their minds on the thrust of the clause and the power to set the relevant date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to be specific to the amendments, but I want to raise a number of concerns with the Minister. Subsection (1) contains the phrase,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1366</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"On and after the relevant date".</p></blockquote>
The Minister should tell us when those powers are likely to be taken by the Secretary of State and the successor authorities and what impact they will have on the planned expenditure of existing local authorities. That is vital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under subsection (1)(a), the Secretary of State and the successor authorities will, effectively, be able to debar existing authorities from disposing of any land for a consideration exceeding £100,000. That causes me concern because the successful Dundee partnership, which involves the regional and district councils in Dundee, along with Scottish Enterprise Tayside and the business community, is trying to change the local economy for the better. It is trying to attract inward investment to Dundee to bring much needed jobs and industry back into the city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A vital part of the strategy being pursued by the Dundee partnership involves the regional and districts councils making available to inward investors land that is currently in their ownership. No doubt there are plans this year, next year and the year after for those councils to make land available to inward investing companies at prices probably in excess of £100,000. I would hate to think that as a result of the clause either the Secretary of State or successor authorities could block those plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not entirely clear about what is meant by successor authorities. In the case of Tayside regional council, the successor authorities will be Dundee, Angus and Perth and Kinross. Would Angus and Perth and Kinross be able to block the sale of Tayside regional council land within Dundee district boundaries and prevent the council from making that land available to the Dundee partnership to promote inward investment? Angus and Perth and Kinross may be in competition with Dundee for the same inward investment and would not be happy for land to be made available in the city of Dundee to attract such investment. Perhaps they can make land available in Angus and in Perth and Kinross. The Minister should deal with that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Timing is important. When will the successor authorities be able to block the intentions of existing authorities to sell land for inward investment purposes? Will successor authorities outside the Dundee area be able to block transactions within the Dundee area? That is important, and it should be made clear at the outset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also concerned about the part of the clause that refers to the councils or the Secretary of State being able to block capital expenditure exceeding £1 million. Tayside regional council currently operates an ambitious programme of capital spending in my area. It plans to spend £13 million on secondary school buildings: not all the work has yet been contracted out. At what stage could it be told by the successor authorities that expenditure plans on schools throughout Dundee and Tayside could be blocked? We need to know when that could happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The plan is to spend £ 12 million on updating primary school buildings in the Tayside area. Will the council be able to go ahead with contracts to turn its plans into reality, or will it constantly have to look over its shoulder to see whether the Secretary of State or the successor authorities want to block its programme?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is planned to spend £10 million on nursery education in the region. What will happen to that? When
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0757">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1367</span>
will the Secretary of State take powers to block the expenditure of that sum? It is planned also to spend £2 million on special education, £4.5 million on general programmes for new technology equipment, including devolved school management, £10 million on general education and property improvements, £1.5 million on community education, including support for the voluntary organisations, and £12.25 million on vehicle replacement programmes. The education department alone in Tayside regional council has a total planned expenditure of more than £90 million over the next five years. It must be confident that it can implement that plan, without constantly having to worry about being beetled at some stage by the Secretary of State or by the successor authorities that take over in 1996.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Grove academy in my constituency in Dundee has a modernisation programme of £2.5 million, which is currently underway. The regional authority plans to spend more than £2 million on Grove academy next year and the year after. Where does that contract, which has begun to be implemented, stand in relation to the clause? Will it be honoured, or can it be blocked or beetled by the Secretary of State or by the successor authorities, even at this stage?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tayside regional council plans to spend more than £ 1 million in 1995–96 on Andover school in Brechin. Will that go ahead, regardless of the powers of the Secretary of State or of the new successor authorities of Perth and Kinross and Dundee which may not want to spend money in that part of Tayside? Tayside regional council plans to spend more than £1 million in 1995–96 on Harris academy in the west of Dundee. What will happen to that expenditure? More than £1 million is planned to be spent next year and the year 1995–96 on general property improvements. What will happen to the money that has been set aside for that task?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister owes it to those who work in local government in Scotland, particularly in the regional councils, to clarify when the powers taken by the Secretary of State and those allocated to the successor authorities will be implemented. The amendment is necessary to identify exactly when the successor authorities are likely to have those powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From what my hon. Friend has said about Dundee and Tayside and the Secretary of State exercising his power at the earliest opportunity—perhaps after the April elections next year—would not that result in nothing being done in Dundee for a year or even more if there were no resolution betweeen authorities of different political persuasions and which might have different priorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point. Tayside regional council wants to implement its agreed plans for modernising the schools and buildings for which it is responsible across the region. That may not be the agreed priority of the successor authorities or of the Secretary of State. That is why the date is particularly interesting. It is highly unlikely that on 1 August 1995 the successor authorities will be in a position to make a judgment on spending in Tayside. The councils will not be elected until May 1995 and will have to confront many immediate problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1368</span>
The councillors elected in May must first consider who won the election in their areas. The majority group must then convene a meeting and decide on the leader and on the appropriate conveners. Even before that, they must decide on their internal management structure and whether they should appoint a general manager or convener, or adopt a committee structure or a Cabinet structure. They must then interview and appoint the directors of all the departments in their areas. Those directors must be consulted about appointing staff and about working out structures within their particular councils. By August they will be nowhere near making decisions about spending programmes. Although the clause refers to the Secretary of State or the successor authorities, it really means the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are constantly told that the great value-for-money Conservative party is concerned about local government expenditure. What my hon. Friend describes is a recipe for not only chaos, but additional costs. If projects cannot go ahead—and with Treasury estimates of inflation going back up—the delays built into the process by this crazy clause will cost the new unitary councils money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has come right to the point. Two sets of authorities will run alongside each other: the existing authorities, which will disappear in 1996, and the successor authorities, which will take over at that stage. Both authorities will be in no position, however, to implement the spending programmes for which they are responsible. The existing authorities will always be aware that they cannot see through to completion those projects and so will not wish to commit themselves to spending that they cannot guarantee will be delivered in the long run. The shadow authorities, running alongside, cannot form judgments about how to implement the spending programmes. Therefore, in the middle is the man with the power—the Secretary of State for Scotland. He could sell this local government reform to the Treasury only because he promised that it would result in substantial savings in public spending. Therefore, what will the Secretary of State do—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order I have let the hon. Gentleman go on for some time, but he is talking as though this was a clause stand part debate. The terms of the amendment are very narrow. I ask the hon. Gentleman to discuss the amendment. Once we get it out of the way we can have a clause stand part debate during which I can call the hon. Gentleman, if he wishes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way, even if it just buys him some time to think about where he goes from here. I have listened carefully as he has expressed his anxiety about the date and the co-operation between the new authorities. He talks as though the new authorities will have no relationship to the old authorities. It is more than likely that the new councillors will come from among the body of existing councillors and so will know what is going on. The new executives may come from existing councils. Therefore, there will be no problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That intervention was definitely wide of the amendment, so I do not expect the hon. Member for Dundee, East to respond to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, Mr. Martin. The amendment is narrow, but the Minister must clarify the point. The problem with the words, "the relevant date" is that the successor authorities will not be in a position to take on such powers until a long time after May 1995. Therefore, we are really discussing the Secretary of State taking on those powers. By inserting "1st August 1995", the amendment would ensure that the successor authorities would at least have a say, though we are not sure that they will be in a position to take advantage of the powers given to them. We want the Minister to clarify how he expects the powers to operate as and from 1 August 1995, which is the critical date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, the hon. Gentleman talks as though the authorities will not co-operate. Why does he have such a lack of faith in the people who will be elected to the new authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot have a lack of faith because I do not know who will be elected to the new authorities. At present the Tayside regional councillors are responsible for the entire Tayside area. To be fair to councillors of every party, they accepted their Tayside-wide responsibilities. They did not operate only with regard to certain localities, such as Dundee, Angus or Perth and Kinross. That will not apply to the successor authorities. They will be interested in their particular areas only. That is where problems will arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am attempting, Mr. Martin, to stick to the narrow description that you have given—and rightly—of the amendment as dealing with "the relevant date". Would my hon. Friend accept that a power accorded to the Secretary of State to specify a relevant date—for example in the case of Strathclyde, where 12 unitary councils would take over functions, contracts, projects and services, 12 police authorities and 12 fire authorities would begin operating and a plethora of joint committees would mushroom everywhere on every subject under the sun—would amount to a recipe for chaos, depending on what that date might be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is exactly that—a recipe for total chaos. All the new councils will, for the first time, be responsible for a range of services that previously did not come under their umbrella. For example, the new Dundee authority will, for the first time, be responsible for education and for social work. It will have to ensure that social work and housing are co-ordinated and that education, leisure and recreation services, as the Minister suggested, cohere and gel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A corporate strategy will be required to ensure that all the services are heading in the direction intended by the council. With those priorities, the successor authorities will not have time in their first year, to examine the spending programmes that are being implemented by the existing authorities operating alongside them. The Secretary of State, however, will. That is why I am concerned about the date. During that period, the Secretary of State for Scotland will take an axe to the spending programmes of local authorities in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1370</span>
Scotland and tell them that they cannot do this or that, build that or modernise this. Programmes will be stopped in their tracks, so that by the time the successor authorities take over it will be too late. All the projects that were in the pipeline and for which money had been identified will have been stopped. The authorities will start from scratch with a lower level of funding. All the service delivery of local government in Scotland will be prejudiced as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know what the Minister is about. That is why we have tabled the amendment. We want to hear, from the Minister's mouth, exactly what the Secretary of State will do in respect of spending programmes to be carried out by local authorities between now and the end of 1996. When can we expect the Secretary of State for Scotland to exercise his powers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had some partisan rhetoric in this debate. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Does the hon. Member for Paisley, South (Mr. McMaster) want to intervene?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon McMaster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a minute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I await that with infinite pleasure. As well as partisan rhetoric, several proper and serious points have been made. I shall try to answer them, while remaining in the confines of the amendment, which, as you have said, Mr. Martin, is limited to the question of timing. No doubt we shall be able to discuss some of the wider issues on reaching later amendments and the debate on clause stand part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) asked whether Perth and Kinross or Angus could block the sale of land in Dundee. Those successor authorities will not be able to block the sale of land there. The Bill is clear. The successor authority for land disposal will be that for the area in which the land is situated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked whether contracts that have already begun could be vetoed under clause 54. I can reassure him that the answer is no. The clause relates only to contracts entered into after the relevant date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just to be absolutely clear, is it the case that contracts that are in the five-year forward plans of the regional and district councils but which have not been entered into formally can be broken?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is the date that a contract is entered into. No contract can be vetoed if it is legally in operation before the relevant date. If it is not in operation, it is not legally in operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment deals with dates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the guarantee extends only to legally committed projects. Could he take that a stage further? Section 94 of the Local Government (scotland) Act 1973, to which the clause refers, provides a useful facility for local authorities. If they lease a piece of land, a building, or some other asset for a period exceeding 21 years, that is deemed to be a capital receipt. In fact, it is known in local government circles as a deemed capital receipt. Does clause 54 change that very useful facility?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0759">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1371</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can deal with the clause when we have debated the amendments to it. When we have disposed of the amendments, the Minister can reply to a wider range of questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank you for your general guidance, Mr. Martin. I will confine my remarks specifically to dates, which is what the amendment is about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rather than I repeat everything that I said, let me simply add, "by that date".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I understand what the hon. Gentleman means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to ensure that the requirement on existing councils to seek the agreement of successor authorities before undertaking major contracts does not unduly hamper their activities during their final year of operation. I do not think that that is a matter of serious dispute. It is equally important, however, that the successor authorities are given the opportunity to take part in decisions on large contract and asset disposal proposals which will have major implications for them in the future. The size of the contracts, as the hon. Member for Fife, Central said, is the subject of amendments that will be debated later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is making use of the term "successor authorities". Will the new water boards be regarded as successor authorities? In incurring capital expenditure in respect of water and sewerage services, will they be blocked by the new shadow water boards?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that those two objectives will sometimes conflict. Therefore, a satisfactory balance must exist between them. That is why we have left the commencement date to be decided later, rather than placing a single date in the Bill, as the amendment would do. With reference to the point raised by the hon. Member for Dundee, East, the new joint police and fire boards might not be established until slightly later in the shadow year, following the election of the individual shadow councils. It is likely, however, that the new water authorities will be established by the spring of 1995. It would therefore be inappropriate to expect police and fire boards and water authorities to begin considering the contracts and disposal proposals of existing councils on the same date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause gives the Secretary of State flexibility. It is possible to alter the intended commencement date at a later stage in the light of discussions with the parties involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When will the Government be able to state what the relevant date will be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair question. The relevant date will be introduced by order and will follow consultation with the parties involved. That is a sensible way for the Government to proceed. The key point is that a fixed date would take away flexibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that the water board could block any project of an existing regional council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1372</span>
What he is really saying is that an undemocratic, unwanted, unaccountable quango could block the decision of a democratically elected authority. Is that the Minister's contribution to democracy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that you, Mr. Martin, would want me to take up the remarks of the hon. Member for Angus, East. We are discussing sensible proposals for the transitional period in relation to contracts. The issue before the Committee is whether there should be a specific date, as suggested by Opposition Members, or flexibility in the dates to be specified by the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is telling us the exact date when democracy is being sold out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may get his press headline for that remark, but looking round the Committee Room, I rather doubt it. I shall confine my remarks to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will find that he has got the headlines today. He says that he is interested in efficient spending by local government. Is it the case that, because of the operation of the dates, a current local authority could have a legally committed project, to design a leisure centre or a school, for example, only for a successor authority to decide that it will not pursue it, even though a considerable amount of money may have been spent? I do not think the Minister is clear about what I am asking. If the only element of a project that has been committed is the design or a feasibility study, but contracts are not out for the construction of the project, is it possible that the money spent could be wasted</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is asking a question that I have answered: can contracts that have begun be vetoed under the clause? The short answer is no. The clause relates only to contracts entered into after the relevant date. If a contract has been entered into before the relevant date or the contract is for the future, the situation is different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it would be helpful if I gave a specific example. A current local authority has decided to build a leisure centre and is legally committed to the design of that centre—for example, Brownside Farm, responsibility for which will pass from Renfrew district to East Renfrewshire—but the successor authority decides that, although the design element is subject to a legal commitment and will be allowed to proceed because it cannot be stopped, it does not want to build the leisure centre. Would the money spent on design be wasted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that the successor authority could have the right to stop subsequent contracts which have not been legally entered into? The short answer to that is yes. A successor authority could obviously do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Paisley, South asked a fair and proper question. The clause relates only to contracts entered into after the relevant date. That is the key point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to help the Minister and the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker). There were flats in the Gorbals and parts of Glasgow that were occupied for 20 years and they then had to be knocked down. However, I know of no flats that were built, remained empty and were then demolished. I challenge the Minister—he says he has a memory—to name them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was simply saying that my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North was probably correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Is it in order not to seek the information now, when it is not likely to be forthcoming, but after we have adjourned so that it is available for our next sitting?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to say that the issue has nothing to do with the amendment or the clause. Hon. Members may pursue that information, but it has nothing to do with the issues before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question before the Committee is whether a specific date should be accepted or whether we should have flexibility. Although the Opposition have deployed arguments for a specific date, given the new structure it is sensible for the Secretary of State to have flexibility. I hope that the Committee accepts that view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What weight does the Minister attach to the unanimous view of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors? It believes that 1995–96 places too stiff a restriction on local authorities. Has the Minister spoken to the institution, which is intimately involved with this problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation about which contracts will be affected. The examples that I gave of Harris and Grove in Dundee and of Andover in Brechin have already incurred expenditure. Therefore, they will be completed in accordance with Tayside regional council's plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Expenditure of £1.5 million is planned for Hillside primary school in Montrose, but that will not begin until 1995–96. That is the critical year because the shadow authorities will be in existence and the regional councils will be running down in their final year. The Secretary
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1374</span>
of State will have the power to freeze further expenditure by regional councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1995–96, will the regional council still be able to begin the contract or will it have to seek the approval of the Secretary of State for Scotland or of the successor authorities in Dundee, Angus or Perth and Kinross?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has asked a fair and reasonable question. The answer depends on the relevant date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the relevant date? The financial year 1995–96 will begin in April. Tayside regional council will still be in existence then. If in April and May of that financial year the council enters into a contract to begin the modernisation programme at the school in Montrose, will it be safe from interference by the Secretary of State for Scotland or by the successor authorities which will replace Tayside regional council after 1996?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is that it depends on the relevant date, on which we shall consult the relevant authorities. The amendment would fix the date. That is not sensible, given that circumstances will vary in the new authorities. There will be differences between the police, fire and water authorities, for example. It is sensible to be flexible so that the Secretary of State can decide on a relevant date after consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do I take it that the Minister's objection to the amendment, which specifies a date, is on the basis that he wants a variety of different specified dates which will vary not only between individual authorities but between individual services? There might, therefore, be a Strathclyde police date, a Kilmarnock and Loudon education date and a Tayside housing date. Is that not likely to lead to much more confusion? Can the Minister say whether, if the dates will be established centrally, they will be announced simultaneously or whether there will be a guarantee of, say, three months or six months before the announcement of a date? If not, it will cause considerable confusion to authorities because those that have been given capital allocations will have a degree of virement; they might feel inclined to use that virement in a budget area for which a freeze date has not yet been set at the expense of an area that has a freeze date. An area such as Strathclyde might be inclined to start a project at, say, Eastwood, in preference to Kilmarnock, because the date for Eastwood had not been set but the date for Kilmarnock had been set. In such circumstances, there would be considerable confusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not envisage varying dates by individual services, but there could be a geographical variation in different parts of the country. The difference between the two sides of the Committee is that rather than having a single, specified day, as suggested in the amendment, the Government believe that it is sensible to have the flexibility allowed in the clause as drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister, doubtless inadvertently, has not addressed himself to the anxieties expressed by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors. Perhaps he would clarify that issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1375</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am intrigued by the Minister's comment that there could be a geographical difference in the dates set. I do not want to give the Minister any more worries, but I wonder whether he is tempting fate. I cite an example close to home. Let us suppose that Renfrew district council, in its infinite wisdom, decided that, taking account of the relevant date set by the Minister, it would legally commit itself to many projects in Barrhead, Neilston and Uplawmoor. Let us suppose that the council is legally committed to a leisure centre in every corner and to building parks. Would the successor authority, East Renfrewshire, inherit the capital debt? If that is the case, I am tempted to nip out into the Corridor and make a telephone call to Councillor Ron Taylor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious to ensure that Hillside primary school is built. My hon. Friend's point is that there are many other such examples. Can the Minister explain the processes involved? How long will the consultation on the relevant dates last? When will the decisions be taken? If the date will vary throughout the country, will the Minister say whom he will consult, how he will decide on the relevant date, and how long and what form the process will take? Why is he involved in what seems a complicated process? I am sure that I am not alone in the Committee in being puzzled by what the Minister has said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As you know, Mr. Martin, I have sat through this afternoon's discussion, as I did this morning. I had not intended to speak until the clause stand part debate, if we have one, when I have one or two more general remarks to make. However, like the hon. Member for Angus, East, I too went through the previous reorganisation. That was hectic, confusing and chaotic enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Up to now I thought that this reorganisation would be difficult, but not impossible. However, after what the Minister has just said, I am astounded. The situation will be impossible. The Minister has suggested that the relevant date for Highland region could be 1 January, for Tayside region it could be 1 February, for Grampian region it could be 1 April and for Strathclyde region it could be 1 August. It is astonishing that there should be such chaos. Last time, there was a transfer of engagements—as we say in the co-op movements—on the same day. Everyone in Scotland was working to the same timetable, using the same advice and criteria. The same circulars were sent out everywhere. People exchanged experience and ideas, and worked together in tandem. Even then, as some hon. Members will know, the transfer arrangements were very difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside made one of the most revealing statements of this debate, perhaps of the whole Committee. With what may have been great naivete, he said that there would be no difference since the successor authorities would have the same people and be much the same, in organisation and structure, as their predecessors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Member has gone a little beyond what I said. I said that there would be a degree of continuity, in that the new councillors would include people who had been councillors before the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1376</span>
reorganisation. The executives also may be drawn from existing executives and therefore would not begin in total ignorance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what I understood the hon. Gentleman to say. As I and my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian said, poor Colonel Saunders may not be with us, unless he gets elected as an independent Conservative, but that is another story.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know Strathclyde area best. I mean no disrespect to the districts, but the main spending services—education, social work, roads, and so on—are provided by Strathclyde region, with a number of Strathclyde councillors. There is no guarantee that they will be the councillors in the 12 new authorities. So we are not comparing like with like—the situation will be entirely different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where a new authority takes over a geographical area—in the way that South Ayrshire will take over from Kyle and Carrick—there will be a contiguity and continuity to the process. But—leaving aside the fact that such new authorities will take over services that are five, six or 10 times the size of their predecessors—the new South Ayrshire authority will be of an entirely different political complexion. A Labour-controlled South Ayrshire authority will have very different priorities from those of the Conservative-controlled Kyle and Carrick council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not develop the point now, Mr. Martin, but I hope that I may catch your eye later. However, I could argue that there is a range of matters in my area for which it might be difficult to gain approval from the new authority, which will have a different political complexion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chaos is revealing. The Minister seems bemused. I believe that he is shell shocked and punch drunk. Perhaps that is due to the absence of the calmer, more thoughtful presence and guiding hand of the Secretary of State. I give way to the shadow Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Committee would like to know that the Secretary of State took part in a brief radio interview at lunchtime. He refuses to appear on any other programmes. He has left the Under-Secretary to carry the can for his discredited policy. That reinforces my hon. Friend's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not follow up that—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to consider the amendment and the specific date that it proposes. I am not allowed to talk about officials. However, I have noticed that the Under-Secretary finds it difficult to respond to some questions. Later, when he reads his brief, he tackles the question that he was not able to answer previously. I advise him to read his brief before he comes to Committee. The Under-Secretary and I can laugh at times, but the laughter is best confined to the Smoking Room, the Strangers' Bar or the Tea Room. We are discussing a serious matter. We are considering property,

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1377</span>
people's jobs and livelihoods, and services for millions of people. Until he checked, the Under-Secretary did not know that there could be different vesting dates. That is significant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says that there will now be dates instead of one date. Is he sure that the Government know what they are doing? The circumstances change by the minute. I hope that my hon. Friend is not so charitable as to suggest that the Government have a definite position—their position moves constantly. There may be several dates by the end of the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely the point that I was trying to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to impose on your sympathy and understanding, Mr. Martin, and trespass beyond what is in order. I have sat through almost every hour of our proceedings. I have noted the chaos and confusion—a phrase that I keep using. The clause is another provision to tick off on the list. My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) is the most assiduous Opposition Member. He will tick off—as I do—all the instances of increasing Government chaos and confusion. That chaos and confusion will cause great problems for the councillors and greater problems for the people. The Bill is ill-thought-out and undesired.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is quite right. People's livelihoods are at stake. There are many worried people in Scotland. Can the Under-Secretary tackle the unanimous anxieties of members of the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, which is at the sharp end of the provision?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like briefly to follow up the Minister's point. He said that when considering the amendment, we must decide whether there should be a fixed date for giving powers to the Secretary of State and the successor authorities, or whether the date should be flexible. We now find that the Minister means flexible dates, which will vary. The variations will depend on geography. That worries me. The Minister also said that the dates would be fixed only after consultation. He has not said who will be consulted. I fear that the Secretary of State, when talking to regional councils and studying their spending programmes, might tell a particular area to go ahead with its desired spending programme because that area happens to be one where he hopes to pick up seats in the ejections in 1998, or whenever. But in an area where the Conservatives have no hope of winning he might say, "The date is now". He might block spending in Labour-controlled areas from that day on, but allow spending in other parts of Scotland where it might be to the advantage of the Conservative party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is shaking his head to show that he does not agree. I would not trust this Minister of this Conservative party with anything because time and again the party has shown its abilty to ignore the wishes of the people of Scotland and go ahead with its own daft programmes. One of the Government's daft programmes may be to cut spending by local authorities in areas where the Tories do not have any political prospects and to ensure that spending goes ahead in areas where they
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1378</span>
do. For that reason, we should stick to a fixed date because a flexible date would give them all the power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to pursue with the Minister the question of the variable dates across the country. Does he mean that the areas will be covered region by region? Obviously, from south Ayrshire to Dumbarton is a large geographical distance, yet the area is within the same authority. The Minister said that the procedure would not be by services. The Strathclyde passenger transport authority, the police and the fire service cover the whole of that area, whereas housing or leisure would not. The Minister must clarify which services he will deal with on a non-overlapping basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The uncertainty about dates will result in a degree of blight. As my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South said, it is possible to let contracts for planning and design and ground preparation before the building contracts begin. It would be the responsibility of authorities to start letting contracts for design and ground preparation, which might, under subsequent authorities, turn out to be a waste of money. The greater the degree of uncertainty, the greater will be the amount of division between the two authorities—the one that is going and the one that is coming in—about when the decision could be made, who could make it and what the priorities would be. A simple date would ensure that all knew where they stood. While it has its difficulties, it is the least undesirable of all the available options.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After all the debates on clauses, it is clear that the Government simply do not have a relevant date. The Bill has a specific date, and to any bystander—not even a member of the Committee—a date is a date. However, after probing by my hon. Friends, we are led to believe that there are several dates. Such a scenario for the existing authorities and the unitary authority successors or for different geographical areas, is a recipe for further chaos. It is a half-baked proposal by Ministers who do not understand the implications for the delivery of services and contracts that my hon. Friends have explained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a right to expect that matters coming before the Committee are thought through. More importantly, when questioned the Minister should be able to give a definite answer about a date—which we may not like but of which we can make sense—rather than have flexible dates at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am giving the Minister the opportunity to clarify what appears to be yet another muddle. Ministers have had a bad day. They are up to their ears in water of one sort or another, but they should be influenced by the referendum result. We have been provided with briefing material from Strathclyde and Lothian. We shall shortly debate the limit of finance. A massive number of projects could be threatened if the Government continue to muddle through with the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is narrow. It does not provoke an abstract debate about a date, or several dates. The debate is about buildings, property, children, schools, and many other matters that need to be taken seriously. If the Minister cannot clarify whether there will be one date or several dates, the Government should think again. The Committee should not accept half-baked proposals delivered in a half-baked fashion. The position is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0763">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1379</span>
ludicrous. One mess or another is revealed in every clause that we debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend the Minister responds, I wish to say that I get worried when I hear some of the speeches that are made. What makes managing anything difficult is uncertainty. It is essential that my hon. Friend understands that people want matters to be clear cut. People who stand for election to councils will know full well that they will be in office for a short period only and that they should not enter into commitments that they cannot see through to completion. Nor should they enter into politically motivated commitments because they will not necessarily be able to see them through. I get very worried when I hear comments about councils of a different colour from Labour—whatever colour those councils may be—because Labour councillors on Labour councils seem to think that they can run anything. My experience is different, which is why I drew attention earlier to housing problems in Glasgow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have great respect for the hon. Member for Tayside, North. Sometimes I agree with a lot of what he says. I agreed with everything that he has just said, right up until he made his final point. Earlier, the hon. Gentleman made an unwarranted criticism of Glasgow. He would go even higher in my estimation if he told the Committee what block of flats he had in mind. If the hon. Gentlemen will identify the flats and be proved correct, I shall accept what he is saying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to pursue that too far, but I shall consult the Library. I am confident that I am right. I remember the matter very clearly. I do not have the details at my fingertips. I would have known the details if the matter had been in my constituency. I hope that, when I produce the evidence, the matter gets the publicity that it merits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister has noted my comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Five times I have asked a civilised question about the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, Mr. Martin. I am very worried about the matter: is there any answer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may assist you, Mr. Martin. We were expecting a response from the Minister, but clearly he remains as confused as ever about the questions. In that case, there is no point in our pushing a probing amendment to a Division. The Government are in utter confusion. I hope that they will reconsider this ill-conceived matter in this half-baked clause.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday, I held a long discussion with Leslie Sharp, the chief constable of Strathclyde, who gave me the authority to refer to the letter that he sent to the chief executive of Strathclyde. In particular, he was concerned about the statement made to the Committee by the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) on 15 March. Referring to the Minister, the letter states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"He was quoted as saying:—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'Joint Boards would be made up from elected members within the constituent authorities, and costs would be apportioned among the constituent Councils according to the actual costs of policing within their area.'"</p></blockquote>
It was the chief constable's impression that that statement was an attempt to reflect the current position in Lothian and Border, and in Northern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the statement is taken at face value and applied to the position in Strathclyde on 1 April 1996, the chief constable's following comments are pertinent. He states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Strathclyde Police is a large organisation which of necessity has to provide considerable central support resources."</p></blockquote>
It is not only a matter for Strathclyde. I rang Graham Bowie, the chief executive of Lothian, who has discussed the issue with Sir William Sutherland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the letter, Strathclyde's joint resources are
	<br><blockquote><p>"Air Support; Police Dogs; Mounted Branch; Underwater Search Unit; Training School; Mobile Support Unit; Traffic Specialists; Forensic Laboratory, and the like.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>All of these facilities are 'deemed led' so it is impossible to compute the costs in advance of a financial year."</p></blockquote>
That is where amendment No. 489 is relevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, not at the moment. On the joint resources, the letter adds:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is therefore impossible to apportion these costs among the constituent authorities within the Joint Board. It would be possible to compute the actual costs at the end of the financial year based upon actual benefits received by each of the local authorities."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The chief constable's experience
	<br><blockquote><p>"shows that these costs vary significantly from year to year, which is understandable, given that they are demand led, and the demands
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0764">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1381</span>
from each of the local authority areas change significantly from year to year. In terms of general policing, although there are police officers, civilian support staff, police vehicles, etc. based at every police station, those resources are available for use"—</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I have attempted to intervene during the hon. Gentleman's speech, but it is my understanding that we are debating the disposal of assets. The regional council, as a police authority, would have control over that. Although Leslie Sharp's letter contains much of interest, I cannot relate it to the amendment. I seek guidance from the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the hon. Gentleman is reading a letter from Leslie Sharp because I told him that he should not read letters; he is making a speech. The quickest way to proceed would be to let the hon. Gentleman make a speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ayr might profitably go and bury himself—[HON. MEMBERS: "Withdraw."] I withdraw that remark. The hon. Gentleman should study deeply the 1967 Act. The words "bury himself were supposed to mean that he should apply his intellectual capacities to the 1967 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Strathclyde and in Lothian, the big police authorities, the letter says that such a thing
	<br><blockquote><p>"is a frequent occurrence and during 1992/93, vast resources were drawn in from throughout the Region for considerable periods of time, to deal with specific outbreaks of serious crime and disorder".</p></blockquote>
The letter refers to Glasgow city centre; dare I say it, the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South; Glasgow east; and Dumbarton. It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"These operations are demand led and are impossible to predict in advance of a financial year, so apportionment of costs among the constituent authorities is equally impossible."</p></blockquote>
That is precisely where the issue of resources comes in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's interpretation of the letter that he has covered. He may not have read it out, but he certainly followed the text closely. The clause and the amendment refer specifically to the disposal of assets by the local authority currently responsible and suggest that there should be consultation with successor authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under present conditions, I do not see how the words of Leslie Sharp and the importance that he places in his letter on the existence of the current local authority and its involvement relates specifically to disposal of assets in the lead-up to the establishment of the successor authority. Leslie Sharp's words perhaps reflect that he would be anxious about the successor authority, but not the existing authority disposing of assets. It is my reading that we are addressing the actions of the existing authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond seriously and courteously to the hon. Gentleman. The problem is, as the hon. Gentleman says, the disposal of assets of the Strathclyde force, particularly the specialist assets. The argument has been that Strathclyde can do this because Lothian already does it in relation to the Lothian and Borders police. My hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian will not dissent if I say that the Borders force is in many ways a client state of the bigger, wider-resourced Lothian force and that for all sorts of specialist support, Borders has to go to Lothian. I do not blame it for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1382</span>
My point was dramatically illustrated when the Dumfries and Galloway force had virtually to rely for specialist expertise on the considerable resources of Strathclyde and of Lothian. That was the fact of the matter. The parallel between Lothian and Borders as a justification of breaking up the Strathclyde force and its assets is, in the opinion of the chief constable and those who take an interest in such matters, a false parallel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman envisage, under the present circumstances, Strathclyde breaking up the resources and involvement of the current police force? If he does not envisage that, does he agree that it would not be cause for concern in relation to these amendments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I think about this is far less important than what the chief constable thinks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first item that I mentioned was air support, for which Strathclyde, very effectively, used police helicopters. Could one small authority undertake such a modern police operation? That question applies equally to the mounted branch and the underwater search unit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a serious question, which I think it right to ask in this debate. I do not know where else in the Bill it would be better to raise this. If you tell me that it would be better to ask this question under another clause, Mr. Martin, I would take your advice, but it is dead on Government amendment No. 489, which is one of the amendments before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend mentioned the costs arising for the Lothian and Borders police force, which is one force now. I may live in the Borders, but I do not represent a Borders constituency. My hon. Friend also referred to the costs incurred by Dumfries and Galloway arising from the Lockerbie disaster, for which, I presume, the Scottish Office provided special funding. There is a great deal of publicity surrounding events in Gloucester. Were similar events to occur in the new local authority areas in Scotland and the costs were attributed to the small authorities on the basis of the policing work done there, that would be very alarming.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I leave the Committee with the thought that many senior police officers in many forces in Scotland are deeply concerned about this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause deals with restrictions on the disposal of assets and the entering into of contracts by the existing authorities. I am concerned about Government amendment No. 486 and its reference to what will happen regarding water and sewerage services. The amendment makes it clear that the successor authority to the elected Tayside, Highland and Grampian regional councils is to be the unelected north of Scotland water authority. The pattern is repeated throughout Scotland: elected authorities are giving way to unelected successor authorities which are quangos created by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said in an earlier debate that the water boards will be in existence from the spring. Did he mean
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0765">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1383</span>
this spring or next spring? Whatever the year, the new successor authorities—the water boards, or quangos—will be in existence at a very early stage. They will therefore have the power of veto over any spending decisions taken by elected regional councils between now and 1996. That causes me a great deal of concern. The northern area water board will need a headquarters building. Why should it be—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
