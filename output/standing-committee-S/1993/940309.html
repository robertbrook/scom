<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Kynoch <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I welcome you, Mr. Hogg, to the Chair. I shall briefly outline the background to the Bill, as it has not been fully debated in the House.<br><br>
The Bill was introduced last year in another place by my noble Friend, Lord Campbell of Croy. I must pay tribute to him for the work that he has done in preparing the Bill and successfully piloting it through the other place. I know that he would also wish to acknowledge the assistance he received from the parliamentary draftsmen in preparing the Bill, and I do likewise.<br><br>
Fish are a valuable renewable natural resource, which is vital to many of our coastal communities. But modern fishing techniques and expanding demand for fisheries products can lead to the over-exploitation of stocks, sometimes to a point where the very future of the stock is jeopardised. In such cases, it is essential that effective conservation measures are taken.<br><br>
The Bill would amend the Inshore Fishing (Scotland) Act 1984. That Act is the main vehicle for regulating fishing in Scottish inshore waters, defined in the Act as being within the six-mile limit.<br><br>
Inshore fisheries are frequently localised in nature. The different conditions that exist around the Scottish coastline mean that conservation measures must be closely tailored towards the conditions of a particular area. The 1984 Act was, therefore, drafted as an enabling measure, and it gives the Secretary of State wide and flexible powers to control fishing activities to ensure that effective conservation measures are in place. To ensure that those wide-ranging powers are used responsibly, the Act requires a period of public consultation before the powers are used. Parliamentary scrutiny is achieved through any statutory instrument being subject to annulment.<br><br>
In general, the 1984 Act has served its purpose well and is rightly regarded by the fishing industry as an effective piece of legislation. However, gaps in its provisions have become apparent in recent years. When the 1984 legislation was drafted, almost all fishing took place from vessels. The remaining activity, mainly hand gathering, was not significant enough to require regulation. The Act was, therefore, drafted to bring vessels under its control, but to exclude other forms of fishing.<br><br>
In recent years, there has been a considerable increase in the amount of fishing on the exposed foreshore. Most worryingly, increasing use is being made of powerful
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
dredging equipment which is pulled across the foreshore at low tide by tractor units. The implements are like ploughs and either mechanically worm feed material from the foreshore into a centrifuge and sieve or suck the foreshore through a filtration system. The power of the units means that they can extract large quantities of shellfish, especially cockles, in a short time. By the nature of the operation, they also disturb the exposed sand, allowing it to dry out. Many of the organisms that live in it are unable to survive, dying before the next tide comes in. Obviously, that affects not only shellfish that are not picked up or are under size, but non-target species. Moreover, the foreshore is left ploughed, instead of flat, until the next tide flattens it.<br><br>
This new means of fishing can lead to exploitation levels that are well above the optimum. Indeed, that has already happened in some areas, most notably on the Solway where significant fishing pressure has contributed to a fall in stock levels.<br><br>
To protect the future survival of the stock, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro), introduced controls on the vessel-based fishing industry in October 1992. He did so with the support of the local vessel owners, since they saw that their long-term prosperity depended on taking immediate action to conserve the stock.<br><br>
Despite that, the pressure on Solway cockles, in particular, has continued since no controls were possible on tractors which continued to dredge the foreshore. Recent scientific assessments of stock levels have shown no improvement. Indeed, numbers of adult cockles have continued to decline. Understandably, local vessel owners, who acted responsibly in calling for controls, have grown increasingly frustrated that they are controlled, but that the mechanised foreshore dredging implements are not.<br><br>
The Bill would allow the inequity to be addressed. Although the 1984 Act is an enabling measure, it does not directly address the issue. Rather, it extends my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State's powers so that he can control the activity of vehicles and equipment on a similar basis to the control of vessels. That would ensure that everyone who contributes to stock decline also contributes towards stock conservation.<br><br>
The problems posed by excessive amounts of land dredging are not limited to the fishing industry. The activities of tractor dredgers also affect local wildlife, especially bird populations, which rely on the foreshore for their food supplies. The south-west of Scotland contains some highly important populations of oyster catchers and two fairly threatened species: scaup and eider. Those, along with knots, sanderlings, bar-tailed godwits, curlews and red shanks all depend on the foreshore for feeding and are, therefore, in jeopardy. Several organisations, including the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, which has been incredibly supportive in the Bill's drafting and to which I pay tribute, have expressed concern that continuing unregulated activity could jeopardise those bird populations. Local groups also believe that their plans to promote tourism, particularly based on nature reserves, are being frustrated through the unregulated activities of dredgers.<br><br>
I should add that I do not believe that all land dredging is necessarily bad. In some areas, judicious amounts of extraction could take place without threatening the local populations of shellfish or the local wildlife which also
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1143">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
relies on the resource. However, it is clear that such activities can cause damage if they take place in the wrong areas or in the wrong quantities. It is, therefore, right that controls can be applied. I hope that my hon. Friend the Under Secretary will briefly explain how he might use the powers.<br><br>
All of the changes have been closely drawn to ensure that they mirror as closely as possible the existing terms of the 1984 Act.<br><br>
I hope that I have not taken more of the Committee's time than was necessary. The Bill will allow a patent inequity to be righted and it will allow sound control of shellfish dredging to ensure that similar problems do not arise in other areas.<br><br>
The Bill enjoys cross-party support. I know that the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) welcomes the Bill—I have had dealings with him, during consideration of another Bill, in connection with the RSPB over the stealing of birds eggs. I know that he strongly supports the RSPB. The Bill is also supported by an impressive array of bodies, such as local authorities, environmental organisations and the fishermen themselves. Indeed it is difficult to find someone who does not support the Bill.<br><br>
Clause 1 contains the main provisions of the Bill. It deletes the word "sea" from the 1984 Act to ensure that fishing activities taking place on the exposed foreshore can be regulated. The trend of all the clauses is to replace the word "sea" so that the foreshore is covered. Clause 1(3) augments the type of activity which the Secretary of State can control to include fishing by equipment or from vehicles. Subsection (4) ensures that where prohibited species are taken as part of lawful fishing activity, so long as those fish are returned immediately to the sea, no offence has been committed. I commend the clause to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for England (Sir Hector Monro)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support strongly the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch). I congratulate him on introducing the Bill. It has the Government's total support and we are most grateful to our noble Friend Lord Campbell of Croy who took the Bill through the other place.<br><br>
I have witnessed the results of tractor dredging for cockles on the Solway, especially at Southerness. I know that it happens elsewhere in the estuary of Kirkcudbright, where the district council is concerned and is working on byelaws which might help.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend said, we must introduce the legislation as soon as possible, for the reasons that he gave and especially because of the effect that dredging is having on the stocks of cockles and on bird life, as was highlighted by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. My hon. Friend has my total support and I hope that the Bill sees the light of day and is enacted as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Wallace <span class='memberconstituency'>(Orkney and Shetland)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I continue the support for the Bill and congratulate the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside on bringing it to this House, following the efforts of the noble Lord Campbell of Croy. No contradictory voice has been raised against this important measure. As the Under-Secretary of State said, the problem has been increasing, especially on the Solway coast. It is important to update legislation to take account of developments that were almost unforeseen when the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
Inshore Fishing (Scotland) Act 1984 was introduced. I assure the Committee that my hon. Friends and I will not impede the Bill's progress.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McFall <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I add my congratulations to those already given to the hon. Member for Kincardin and Deeside. I have worked with him, the RSPB and others on Bills and I am delighted to be associated with this Bill. I have received inquiries from constituents and the Under-Secretary of State is aware of the problems for bird life in the Solway and other areas. Anything that may rectify that has the support of the Opposition. I look forward to working with the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside on environmental matters such as this.<br><br>
Can I refer briefly to clause 2—</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I call Mr. McFall.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You were up earlier than me this morning, Mr. Hogg.<br><br>
Under the provision in clause 2 of new subsection (1A)(c) it seems that the hirer of a vehicle or of equipment could be guilty of an offence. I have received queries from companies such as Hertz and Avis. Would the offence relate solely to the person renting the car or could it relate to Hertz or Avis? Despite legal opinion, I was asked to raise the matter in our debate on the clause. My understanding is that the provision relates only to the person who rents a car and that the hirer would not be affected. Will the hon. Gentleman comment on that for the sake of those who may be affected?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are here creating new offences and I would like to know what the penalties will be on conviction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dumbarton raised an interesting matter. The equipment concerned is not similar to a car. No one will innocently go out and hire a power-suction dredger for the day and then suddenly decide to suck up the beach on the Solway Firth.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A friend could rent a car from Avis and park it alongside the dredger.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly get back to the hon. Gentleman on this, but I undestand that the provision would not cover a car parked alongside the dredger; it would cover the equipment that is doing the damage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend on the excellent way in which he presented the case for the Bill? Following the comments made by the hon. Member for Dumbarton, it may be more appropriate to refer to a tractor than to a car. A tractor and the dredging unit could be hired from separate sources. The hirer of the tractor may have no connection with the hirer of the dredger.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for those comments. If a car is parked alongside a dredger, it would have to be an integral part of the activity. If it is simply parked alongside, as far as I am aware, it would not be caught up under the provision.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for that answer. I am not trying to trap him, but he knows the landmark case of Pepper v. Hart in the House of Lords, which means that litigants going to court can quote <i>Hansard</i> to clarify the intention of the Bill. With that in mind I should like the intention recorded in <i>Hansard,</i> so that in any future case the hon. Gentleman's name can flash up in court in connection with clarifying the intentions in passing the Bill.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We note that the Bill will come into force
<br><blockquote><p>"on such day as the Secretary of State may by order … appoint."</p></blockquote>
How quickly does the Minister see not only the order enacting the Bill coming into effect, but any order made as a result of the Act to extend the Inshore Fishing (Scotland) Act 1984 to cover the activities against which the Bill is directed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As soon as the Bill is an Act of Parliament, we shall bring in an order. As that needs a negative resolution, it should be in place as quickly as possible. Later we shall consult the interested parties. It is important to bring in the order through the proper parliamentary procedures as soon as possible after the Bill is enacted.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Clause 5 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I want to take this opportunity to thank you for chairing this brief Committee. I wish that all Committees that we sit on were as brief, as matter of fact and as positive as this one has been. I also want to take the opportunity on behalf of the Committee of thanking the Clerk and the <i>Hansard</i> writer for their efforts in making it appear so smooth.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg. Is it in order for me to agree with everything that has just been said?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that it is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order on agreement, Mr. Hogg. I assure the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside that if his hon. Friends brought in legislation that commanded consensus in Scotland, they might find that Committee stages proceeded more quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The question is—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Are you sure about it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, absolutely. It seems to me from my brief involvement in this place that Conservative Members are always introducing legislation that is valid, logical and full of common sense. It comes as a great surprise to me that there are so often differences of opinion.</span></p>
