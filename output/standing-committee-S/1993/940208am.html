	<p>[SIR JAMES KILFEDDER 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Local Government etc. (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Copies of the provisional selection of amendments are available in the Room. Exceptionally, on this occasion—I emphasise on this occasion—we thought it would be helpful to hon. Members if each group of amendments to schedule 1 were headed by a brief description of the local government area to which it relates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. This Committee has been wandering round like a nomad. Would it not be sensible for us to remain in one Room and, bluntly, one in which there could be television coverage? More and more people are becoming extremely interested in the ridiculous proposals that we have been asked to consider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Kynoch 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. May I make a strong plea that we move to a slightly larger Room. This Committee is well attended and conditions are cramped for hon. Members. When we come to the Bill's provisions and especially those on boundaries, I know that many of our constituents will travel from Scotland to hear what is going on. Although the Public Gallery is not recognised as part of the Committee, it is very cramped. I also support the comments of the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) about television coverage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that this is an important Bill, which we shall be discussing for some time. We can sit in Committee Room 10 in the morning, but we should have to leave it after the lunchtime adjournment. That would be unsatisfactory. The Clerk has already spoken to the authorities and, this afternoon, I intend to make the feelings of hon. Members known to the Serjeant at Arms and to anyone else who can determine the Room that we shall have. The Committee deserves a Room that is big enough and suitable for us to consider this important Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREAS IN SCOTLAND</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 2, line 10, leave out "1996" and insert "1998".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 2, in page 2, line 14, leave out "1996" and insert "1998".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No. 19, in page 2, line 14, leave out "1996" and insert "2000".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse the views of my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow and of the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch). It is absurd that a Bill of this importance should be debated in such cramped conditions. We could also put it to the Leader of the House that an ideal forum for debating such legislation exists in Scotland—the Crown Office building in Edinburgh. If we used that building, it would be possible for Scottish Members, English Members, who have such a deep interest in Scottish affairs, people from all over Scotland and the press to follow our proceedings. I hope that you, Sir James, will be able to assist on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would defer the implementation of part I of the Bill covering the abolition of existing regions and districts and the introduction of a new system from 1996 to 1998, and, in the case of amendment No. 19, to the year 2000. The purpose of that delay of two or four years would be to make it possible for a proper, open and independent review of the structure of Scottish local government to be undertaken in the context of the establishment of a Scottish Parliament by the next Labour Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a prudent delay would avoid all the massive costs to taxpayers and the disruption to local services and institutions that are inherent in this shoddy Bill. It would ensure that we achieved the broadest possible consensus about the future of local government and it would make it possible to create a new structure that would stand the test of time. The Bill will not stand the test of time, but it will lead to the waste of a lot of effort and energy and cause a lot of agony. It is shot through with confusion and contradictions. It has been brought before the House by a Government who have been consistently hostile to the concept of local democracy and local services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth comparing the background to the Bill with that to the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. The 1973 Act followed a long period of public debate and consultation during and after the deliberations of a royal commission. At that time there was consensus on the fact that something was fundamentally wrong with Scottish local government; no such consensus exists today. The Wheatley commission was established to examine the need for the reform of Scottish local government. It included members of all political parties and of none, for example: Tom Fraser, a distinguished Labour politician in Scotland; Betty Harvie Anderson, the Minister's predecessor as the Conservative Member for the former constituency of East Renfrewshire and a former Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons; the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) and professionals and academics who had an intimate knowledge of the provision of services and Scottish local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That independent royal commission spent three years considering the way forward for local government in Scotland. It undertook genuine public consultation and its overriding objective was to strengthen Scottish local government. The structure that it recommended has stood the test of time, despite the harsh environment created by a hostile Government in the past 15 years. The Government now have the benefit of good local services and genuine local accountability. In recent years, Scotland's elected local authorities have done a remarkably good job in protecting their local communities in difficult circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0060">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>93</span>
The Government's current proposals are not the consequence of a serious review and are not designed to strengthen Scotland's local government. On the contrary, they are designed deliberately to debilitate local democracy and local services. If there is any discontent now about Scottish local government, it has been stirred up by malicious mischief making by the Government—all that rubbish about Strathclyde being a monstrosity. The people who depend on the quality services in Strathclyde or my constituents in Lothian do not regard the authorities that provide their education and social services as monstrosities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the hon. Gentleman is fascinated by Strathclyde. I must tell him, however, that Tayside region has never been popular in my constituency and, today, there are demands to get rid of the region because it is felt that people in Dundee do not understand the problems of highland Perthshire and highland Angus.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there is such a feeling, I suspect that it has been stirred up by people such as the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker). Those in his constituency who have access to education services and who, for example, can use centralised specialist education facilities for disabled and other handicapped children might not be as enthusiastic about criticising the providers of such services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the record, the view just expressed by the hon. Member for Tayside, North is not shared by Conservative councillors in Dundee and in the Tayside region. The leader of the Conservative group on Tayside regional council would disagree entirely with the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are witnessing the consequence of a cynical policy of divide and rule which the Conservative party has deployed in Scotland in recent years. Strathclyde region, Tayside region, Lothian region and the other regions have provided high quality strategic services in difficult circumstances. No satisfactory case has been made for destroying and dismantling those services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it be possible, through my hon. Friend, for the sedentary comment of the hon. Member for Tayside, North about Bruce Mackie to be recorded in 	<i>Hansard</i>?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I did not hear any comment by the hon. Member for Tayside, North.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Linlithgow knows that I never say things privately that I am not prepared to say publicly. I am having problems in my constituency with children requiring special treatment and special schools, and I said that the hon. Gentleman had picked on the wrong topic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not qualified to comment on specific details in specific areas, but, to stick to the fundamental point, it is far easier for large strategic authorities to provide that type of service than it is for
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
smaller authorities, by and large, across the nation of Scotland, regional councils are providing good quality services in difficult circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following the hon. Gentleman's argument carefully, but if he is so much in favour of Lothian regional council, why does his amendment provide for it being split rather than retained? He could have put down an amendment to retain it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Committee is not going to have to endure such a trivial approach to the debate. Our position is abundantly clear: there should be no legislation to reform the current structure of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we understand that the Government—with the benefit of their English reinforced majority—will insist on driving the Bill through, we are forced to contemplate a fallback position. We shall discuss that when schedule 2 is debated. The purpose of the amendment is to kick the matter into touch so that a proper review can be conducted and Scottish local government can be strengthened instead of being wrecked, as the Government propose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Government's proposals, there will be nothing left of Scottish local government but our provost chains, because everything else will be contracted out or passed to quangos and joint boards without accountability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yesterday, I heard the Secretary of State for Scotland say on the radio a most amazing thing that clearly is not true. He said that many people appointed to quangos in Scotland give their service voluntarily and without payment. My understanding is that the people appointed to health boards, health trusts and enterprise trusts in Scotland are paid substantially; indeed, they are paid a great deal more than elected councillors. Most of them are Tory placemen and placewomen. Does my hon. Friend agree with me? Will he put the Secretary of State for Scotland right?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that it is in order, for me to do that, but the way in which the Scottish Office manages the quangocracy that governs so much and controls so much expenditure in Scotland is little short of corrupt. It appoints and pays people, usually those who have been rejected by the electorate. That is intolerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The June 1991 consultation paper was a shoddy document of just 10 pages of text. It stated the Government's intention to introduce single-tier local government. In July 1993, the White Paper—with its fantastic gerrymandered boundaries and the other detailed proposals that form the basis of the Bill—was published. No independent commission could have come up with anything remotely resembling such a package.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper and the Bill are a shameless exercise in political thuggery in Scotland. I shall discuss one example of the cynical charade of consultation that proceeded the Bill and try to work out where on earth it came from. When the Committee discusses schedule 1, it will examine the details of the proposed Berwickshire and East Lothian authority. I shall explore the process that led to such an outlandish idea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0061">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>95</span>
I do not know, Sir James, how well you know the geography of Scotland, but the Lammermuir hills are a fairly obvious feature on the map of Scotland. Never in recorded history has there been any form of local administration straddling those hills. Most importantly, there is no public record of anyone or any body of public opinion supporting such an idea. Nobody owns up to the authorship of the Berwickshire and East Lothian local authority proposal. It is extremely difficult to find anyone on either side of the Lammermuirs who supports it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is credible speculation that it may be the product of the creative opportunism of some Tory party strategists, but it is demonstrably not a product of any kind of public consultation. There it is in the Bill, however, plucked straight from some smoke-filled room in Tory party headquarters in Edinburgh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After the experience of the poll tax, Parliament should think twice before again inflicting rubbish legislation on Scotland. An open, independent review would have nipped the poll tax in the bud and an independent commission on local government would lead to something very different from the Bill. The amendment would allow time for such an independent review. It would also allow time for local government reform to be set in the context of a long-overdue reform of Scotland's national administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scotland now probably has the most autocratic, remote and unaccountable administration of any nation in western Europe. It is hardly surprising that some people are becoming cynical about a democratic system that has allowed a succession of unaccountable Tories to govern our country with such total impunity for so long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A crank called Douglas Mason dreamed up the poll tax. He sold the idea to the then Scottish Office Minister, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) and, hey presto, Scotland became the guinea pig for the poll tax, "Just like that", as Tommy Cooper would have said. Now here we go again, the water industry is no longer to be subject to democratic control and local boundaries are to be shamelessly carved up, without a proper review, without regard for the effect on important local services and without democratic consent. Since 1979, people in Scotland have been voting by increasing majorities, for home rule within the United Kingdom. We will have a Scottish Parliament, because it is necessary for the good government of Scotland and because our people want it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is very likely that, besides taking control of the Scottish Office, and taking back some of the power that has been handed over to Tory-appointed quangos, a Scottish Parliament might also take a hand in decisions affecting some major strategic services now run by the regions. That arrangement would leave local services to single-tier local authorities, which would be genuinely local.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman refers to the prospect of a Scottish Parliament. Would he tell the Scottish people how much that might cost them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggest that it would cost about the same as, or perhaps rather less than, the current corrupt Administration in the Scottish Office, where all
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
power is vested, where all that taxpayers' money is spent, and where all those unaccountable quangos are nominated. Those bodies administer Scotland. They have power but no accountability. Democratic government is efficient government and taxpayers' money should be spent in Scotland by consent, not according to the corrupt practices of the Conservative party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just want to be sure that I heard the hon. Gentleman correctly. Did he say that, in his view, a Scottish Parliament would take strategic services from the regions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am speculating because I am not authorised to speak on behalf of the Labour party Front Bench, but I consider it extremely likely that a Scottish Parliament would take charge of certain strategic services currently run by the regions—for example, in higher and further education. The Scottish Parliament would administer some strategic services, but genuinely local services would be operated by democratically accountable local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I think that it is important for hon. Members to be able to make their speeches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give way to my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is, of course, great confusion in the Committee, arising from the richness of Robertsons available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) that it would be for the Scottish Parliament to decide what powers it would exercise over or share with the then local government system. Just as the Minister and the Government are responsible for local government—although they make a hash of it—a Scottish Parliament would have legislative responsibility for the structure and powers of local government and would do a good job of allocating responsibilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not aware that I was saying anything all that exciting. The Scottish Parliament will be elected by the Scottish people—unlike the present Administration in the Scottish Office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I have had enough Robertsons for one day. For 15 years, Scotland has laboured under a Government that it has not elected. It has seen money wasted on the assisted places scheme and on all manner of things which were not an appropriate use of publish money. I think that it would be rather good if we had services, as well as legislative work, undertaken with consent of the Scottish people through a Scottish Parliament. When that Parliament is elected, that will be the right time to legislate for single-tier authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0062">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
This Government are on the way out and they should not waste Scotland's energy and resources on this botched and unwanted local government legislation at this point in history. Ministers are keen on deluding themselves that these proposals for single-tier authorities are popular. As I said, there may well be a strong case for a single-tier system under a Scottish Parliament. However, if the Minister undertook a proper, open consultation on the principles, costs and consequences of the Bill, he would be told exactly where to put it—and that would not be on the statute book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is not a serious approach to local government reform. It is a rather trivial ploy to play havoc with Scotland's local authorities and to waste time in Parliament. Certainly, it achieves both those objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would kick the issue into touch. As we saw, the English were quite good at that, and some rather devious hand work, at Murrayfield on Saturday. The amendments would let Scotland elect a Parliament and conduct a proper review of local government structures before any restructuring took place. In the meantime, our regional, district and islands councils should be allowed to continue the high quality service that they currently give to our people. Indeed, our regional and islands councils will receive a new mandate at the elections on 5 May, regardless of the Bill. Those councillors' terms of office should be allowed to run then-course to 1998 to allow time for this dog's breakfast to be superseded by a proper review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is a waste of time, energy and resources because it cannot possibly stand the test of time. If this Committee and this Parliament were taking Scotland seriously, they would stop this wasteful disruption and create a framework for consensus. The amendment would make it possible for that to happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I had better not follow the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) in commenting on last-minute kicks in rugby internationals.

This debate has already proved to be of great usefulness. Week after week and month after month the Opposition have told us that their proposals for a Scottish Parliament would, under no circumstances, take responsibilities away from local government. That has been their stance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, is that not so?—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Ah, so there is at least a possibility, if not a probability, that a Scottish Parliament would take powers from existing Scottish local authorities. That is now the common ground.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may give them more powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But that is not what the hon. Member for East Lothian said. When opening this debate, he said on behalf of his colleagues that he envisaged that a Scottish Parliament would take strategic services from the regions. That was not a slip of the tongue. It was a prepared speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether my hon. Friend is aware of this, but yesterday, when we were
	<span class='label label-info column'>98</span>
having a debate Downstairs on Scottish democracy, the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) agreed with my point that a Scottish Assembly would take powers from local authorities. The hon. Gentleman was candid and said that that would happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we now have agreement that a Scottish Parliament would take powers from Scottish local authorities, as the hon. Member for East Lothian suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that this will continue to be a useful debate. Opposition Members will no doubt take the opportunity to put forward their views on how a Scottish Assembly or Parliament should be set up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee is familiar with the views of the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) who opened the debate on the Floor of the House yesterday. He is in favour of a multi-option referendum for a Scottish Parliament. Indeed, he actively campaigns for it. He is involved in a £1.6 million fund-raising programme. I read in the press that, to help pay for the plan, activists are being asked to sell raffle tickets with a top prize—wait for it—of a holiday for two in Cuba.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given my hon. Friend's reference to a multi-option referendum and the apparent support from the Opposition Front Bench yesterday for that concept, does he not acknowledge that, during the election, the Labour party in Scotland campaigned against such a multi-option referendum? Does that not contrast with the Conservative party's strenuous campaign for single-tier local authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The Opposition have an opportunity to clarify their position on the multi-option referendum for a Scottish Parliament in advance of the reorganisation of local government and on other matters. I do not know whether members of the Committee heard the Whip suggest that the second prize in that raffle was actually two holidays in Cuba.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East is quoted in his local paper 	<i>The Courier and Advertiser</i> of 13 September as regretting the lack of official support. It added that he
	<br><blockquote><p>"hoped ordinary Scots would overcome it."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member is surrounded this morning by those who claim to be ordinary Scots. No doubt, when he comes to address us he will be able to tell us how many of his colleagues have bought raffle tickets in that cause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the amendments to the timetable before talking about a Scottish Parliament and an independent commission. The question whether local authorities should have more time to prepare for the transfer is of considerable importance to them. I want to put one or two points about that on the record. In considering the timetable for the reorganisation, we paid close attention to the many arguments that have been put to us. We have had to balance the obvious need to ensure that the new councils have adequate time to get themselves up and running with the widely expressed desire that any period of uncertainty is minimised. Without any question, the amendments before the Committee would lengthen the period of uncertainty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to maximise the time available to shadow councils, I announced on 16 September last year our
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0063">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>99</span>
intention to hold elections to the shadow authorities on 6 April 1995, rather than on May day which would have been more customary. That change, which had been requested by, among others, SOLACE—the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives—has been welcomed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister be absolutely clear with us? What advice have the Government received from SOLACE about the timing? Is it at ease with the Government's timetable or does it have reservations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: SOLACE asked for the May date of the elections to be put back, which we have done, to 6 April. SOLACE has welcomed that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are the Government saying that SOLACE is completely satisfied with the current proposals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it is my understanding that SOLACE is content about the timetable of the proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But does it agree with it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have made it clear that SOLACE asked for the date to be changed. It was changed and it is content with what the Government have done. It wanted a delay and the Government have conceded one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government have brought the date forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have because it gives a longer period for preparation after the elections. That is what SOLACE asked for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must be careful to ensure that the period of uncertainty is not extended too far. We have already heard some representations from bodies concerned with what they term planning blight. In particular, those bodies are concerned that local authorities will stop planning for the future and that services will therefore suffer. Although I hope that most councils will take steps to avoid that problem, it is clearly one that must be taken into account when we are setting the time scale for reorganisation. For that reason, I suspect, on practical grounds, many bodies would be unhappy with the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is vital that the Minister does not distort the imputation behind the amendments. They are not about extending the transition, but about making sure that effects of the Bill do not see the light of day either in respect of the elections or in the delivery of services. That is what these technical amendments will do. They will allow for debate on important issues such as a Scottish Parliament and the question of an independent commission which have not been fully aired in Scotland. I hope that the Minister will accept that the amendments are not about the transition, but about ensuring that the Bill does not result in elections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So these are wrecking amendments. The hon. Gentleman has conceded that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If the amendment were a wrecking amendment, it would not have been selected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should now acknowledge that I have clarified the position from the Opposition Front Bench, while you, Sir James, have clarified the position on the selection of amendments. The Clerks would not have selected a wrecking amendment. We have put our case clearly. The Minister should accept that and not confuse it with extending the transition process. The amendments are not about the transition process. They would ensure that we have proper debate on key issues that the Government are ignoring. We do not want the Bill to meet the election timetable that the Minister suggested. He should accept that and clear up any confusion which may exist in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I was not criticising the selection of amendments. Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that the amendments do not relate to the exact timetable of transition, which is a point of considerable importance to local authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will be aware that, on many occasions, the Chair quite properly does not select amendments that are judged to be wrecking amendments. That does not prevent amendments appearing on the amendment paper that could, if implemented, make the Bill do what it did not set out to do. Although they are not considered to be wrecking amendments, the end result is the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point clear. Of course, if the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) is suggesting that the amendments are not about the transitional period, I accept that that is not their purpose. However, the amendments could be interpreted as being about the length of time that the new structure should be allowed to get up and running. If that is not the perfectly reasonable explanation for the amendments, I accept that they are designed to make purely political points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the invitation of the hon. Member for Fife, Central, I shall move on to more general points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, if the Minister is moving on—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have given way three times, mostly at the invitation of the hon. Member for Fife, Central.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister giving way? If not, the hon. Member for Linlithgow should resume his seat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am not giving way. I do not mean any disrespect to the hon. Member for Linlithgow, but the hon. Member for Fife, Central has asked me to move on. Therefore, it is reasonable to do so. As always, I am responsive to his suggestions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend moves on—he was diverted—he was talking about a planning vacuum. Can he give comfort to my constituents in Banchory, who are anxious that they have been given a capital allocation by Kincardine and Deeside district council to upgrade a swimming pool for a period that runs beyond the council's term? Will he give them comfort by saying that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0064">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>101</span>
transition period, as short as it is, will be sufficient to enable a proper continuity of that work?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I can give my hon. Friend that commitment. We are examining forward commitments in detail in the context of reorganisation. That is a factor that we had to take specifically into account when deciding the best period of transition. If a longer period of transition had been offered, the possible difficulties, such as those to which my hon. Friend referred, could have been all the greater.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have given way five times to the hon. Gentleman, but will give way for a sixth time during my short speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not try to intervene earlier because the Minister was about to complete a passage of his speech. I want to ask him about planning. Yesterday, I talked at length to Iain Hay, the chairman of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has a considerable interest in the matter. He is based at 9, Manor place in Edinburgh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Hay asked if, in the circumstances, forward plans—particularly those for sewerage systems—being examined by surveyors in Scottish Office during the transition period had been cleared with existing local authorities. The members of a professional organisation have been put in the most acute difficulty. What discussions have taken place with the RICS about those difficult problems?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware in detail of any discussions that may or may not have taken place, but the forward plans for the water and sewerage systems of the existing authorities are, at least in outline, public knowledge. They were published by the regional authorities. There is no difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Knapman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stroud)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the many good reasons for my being on the Committee is that I am a chartered surveyor. I have thought about the points being discussed by the hon. Member for Linlithgow. I am not aware from the RICS's correspondence of the acute difficulties to which he referred. I would be happy to speak again should particular points be raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for speaking with expert knowledge. To be fair to the hon. Member for Linlithgow, he may not have been necessarily suggesting that difficulties had arisen, but asking whether there were plans to which the RICS could have access.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to the clarification by the hon. Member for Fife, Central of what lies behind the amendment, I shall discuss the two central points. The amendment would defer the introduction of the reform of local government until after the establishment of a Scottish Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And an independent commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. As I said on Second Reading, I do not believe—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>102</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It appears that Labour Members are asking us to create a Scottish Assembly that is supposed to consider all Scottish matters. It seems that they are now saying that such an Assembly would not have the capacity to deal with matters such as local government reorganisation and so, in effect, another quango would have to be appointed to assist it. Is not that wasteful bureaucracy in the extreme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am the first to admit that I am not always clear about Opposition policy, which is understandable because, as is obvious this morning, Opposition Members are not clear about it either. I understand that the Opposition would establish a Scottish Assembly, which would establish an independent commission. The Assembly—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the Assembly or Parliament—I am feeling generous toward the hon. Member for East Lothian this morning—would then pass an Act to implement or not implement the commission's proposals. A new structure would be established.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just like Wheatley.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the same as Wheatley. The timetable for reorganisation that we propose for the implementation of the proposals is almost exactly the same as that in the 1973 Act, which followed the Wheatley commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the scenario outlined by my hon. Friend, would there still be the office of Secetary of State for Scotland if there were to be a Labour Government sometime in future? If so, what part would the Secretary of State play? Would there be a commission and, when the Scottish Assembly gave its view, would the Secretary of State have overriding command and involvement, or would there be no place for the Secretary of State?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. The Opposition would have a Secretary of State for Scotland—the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson)—but he would have nothing to do. He could return to his traditional interest in foreign affairs because he would have nothing to do with Scottish housing or Scottish education. He would have nothing to do with Scotland, except when he studied the Budget once a year. He could be a roving ambassador; a Minister without portfolio. He would be doing nothing, but would, of course, be earning the full salary of a Cabinet Minister. Who could blame anyone for wanting to have what would perhaps be the cushiest number in western democracy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would he be able to vote in the House on any matter relating to Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He would be able to vote, on behalf of United Kingdom taxpayers, on annual grants to the Scottish Parliament. Otherwise, he would not be able to vote on issues relating to housing in Hamilton, but he could vote on housing in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson). He would not be able to vote on schools in St. Andrews, but
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0065">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>103</span>
he could vote on schools in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Knapman). He would not be able to vote on anything to do with Scottish issues, but his votes would be decisive on matters relating to English local government, to Welsh local government and to local government in Northern Ireland. My hon. Friends may wish to return to that point later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members have alleged that a Scottish Assembly—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or Parliament—I am being generous this morning—could be set up at no cost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I just return to one of the subjects that the Minister discussed? On Thursday, he assured me
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State is in Cabinet, defending Scotland's interests."—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 3 February 1994; c.9.]</p></blockquote>
From what or whom was he defending them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. right hon. Friend was attending the Cabinet, as he always does, making sure that the entire Cabinet was aware of Scotland's interests and defending those interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Against whom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Against anyone whose interests might take a different form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the Cabinet?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, not in the Cabinet. My right hon. Friend ensures, of course, that Scotland's view is heard in Cabinet. Is the hon. Member for Hamilton suggesting that Labour Secretaries of State did not do that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend care to contemplate why an hon. Member who aspires to become, one day, Secretary of State for Scotland, should inquire about how the Secretary of State should perform his duty to defend Scotland's interests? Should not we all like to know what that hon. Member for Hamilton would be likely to do if, by misfortune, he ever got the job?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is all very interesting, but I think that we should now return to discussion of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On expenditure, Labour Members have suggested that the Scottish Parliament would be set up in order, among other things, to reform Scottish local government and that that would be cost free. That was not the view taken by the previous Labour Government when it made its devolution proposals. Hon. Members have referred to the explanatory and financial memorandum provided for the Bill. Similar memoranda were also, of course, attached to the devolution Bills of that Labour Government. If the figure given for the Scotland Bill of the late 1970s is uprated, it reveals extra public expenditure, on running costs, of just under £50
	<span class='label label-info column'>104</span>
million a year. That leaves aside the one-off costs associated with providing the necessary building and support services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that some of the running costs could be offset. Labour Members may offer to halve their salaries, because, in their constituency role, they would have no responsibility for Scottish matters. No such offer has, however, been put on the table.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the question of costs, will the Minister, at a convenient point in his speech, return to the figure of £40 million that I mentioned last week in relation to information technology? In an age when computer-based information processing is critical to the efficient running of services, it is essential that there should be a smooth transition of systems and information to new councils. There is great uncertainty, however, about the compatibility of systems between the divisional offices of departments, between the departments themselves and especially between district and regional councils. The matter is a serious one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a serious matter to which I shall respond now, although to do so slightly disrupts the trend of my speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figure of £40 million which, I believe, comes from the document produced by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, and perhaps from other sources, is not incompatible with the Government's own estimates, of £20 million. The difference between the two figures arises because COSLA envisages continuing changes in information technology systems after reorganisation. Those would be desirable changes, but would not be essential to the process of reorganisation. I believe that those two figures are broadly compatible because they have not been calculated on the same basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the costs of running the Scottish Assembly are the same as the traditional costs of information technology, what is the Minister's problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem is not mine but the Labour party's. I can understand the hon. Gentleman's position. The problem is that it is absolutely clear that a Scottish Assembly, as proposed in the amendment, would cost extra public expenditure. The hon. Member for East Lothian confirmed that. That contrasts with statements made on Radio 4 on 26 January by the shadow Chancellor, who said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have said that there are no manifesto commitments at this stage to public spending and that has been made absolutely clear throughout the summer months and beyond."</p></blockquote>
The Labour party—although not the Scottish National party cannot have it both ways. The shadow Chancellor cannot say that there are no commitments to any extra expenditure when at the same time Labour Members make commitments to extra expenditure in this Committee. If the shadow Chancellor is saying that there are no commitments to any extra public expenditure except to a Scottish Parliament, that is fine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. Is it in order for the Minister to attempt a filibuster on his own? That will certainly be taken into account if it is ever suggested that the Bill should be guillotined.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I turn finally to the points made by the hon. Member for East Lothian. I do not believe that his timetable can be delivered in anything like the timescale proposed in the amendment. It would be possible to set out a Scottish Parliament after, as he assumes, a Labour Government came to power. An Act would be passed to set up a Scottish Parliament followed by an Act to set up an independent commission, which would have to sit for between 10 and 15 months. The recommendations then would have to be considered for another year or so. Another Act would then have to be passed to set up a new structure of local government. That would be followed by the establishment of shadow authorities and then, finally, the new authorities would have to be elected. That could not be done in under seven to eight years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I presume that the Minister's officials have given the matter some consideration. I should be happy to table a manuscript amendment to take the proposal further in the light of that detailed information if the Minister could specifiy what date would be required to make it all hang together. If he gives us the date we shall table a manuscript amendment, which we can all support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has to work out his own amendment. I am responsible for tabling
	<span class='label label-info column'>106</span>
Government amendments. My admirable civil servants are responsible for many things but drafting Opposition amendments is not one of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's timetable is not feasible. It could not be done in that time scale.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For all the reasons that I have given to the Committee. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not interrupt me from a sedentary position because, if he does, his hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley will criticise me for speaking too long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened to Labour Members suggesting that an independent commission should have been set up. That topic has been the subject of debate after debate for several years. It was considered carefully when the process of consultation first began in 1991. For reasons that I shall mention, it was decided that an independent review was not necessary. [Hon. Members: "Why?"] I am just about to tell the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is misleading to compare this reorganisation with what occurred in the 1970s. The Wheatley commission was asked to undertake a mammoth task. When it undertook its review of local government in Scotland, the structure was very different from what it is now. There were 426 local authorities—counties of cities, large burghs, small burghs, counties and districts. Wheatley likened the system to a
	<br><blockquote><p>"patchwork quilt dotted liberally but unevenly with beads".</p></blockquote>
This contrasts dramatically with the current system of 65 local authorities and serves to illustrate the different scale of the exercise today compared with 20 years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That point is confirmed by what is on the amendment paper and to be considered later. The Opposition amendments about boundaries are, of course, different from those tabled by the Government. However, in area after area, Opposition Members have accepted the Government's proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the Opposition did not intend to amend the proposals although I accept that the hon. Member for Hamilton may table more amendments on boundaries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me make it clear to the Minister what we are doing. First, in this debate, we are making it clear that we are opposed to the butchery of Scottish local government that will take place without even an independent review let alone a review by a Scottish Parliament which should have that role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall also vote against clause 1. If we are unsuccessful on that, we shall move on to schedule 1 where we shall highlight some of the anomalies in the Government's proposals. The option exists at the end of our consideration of schedule 1 to vote on that so the Minister should take no comfort from the fact that no amendments have been tabled. We are concentrating our attention and fire on the most blatant of the Government's gerrymandering proposals and the wholly inadequate way in which local government is being reorganised. The fact that we have not tabled any
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0067">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>107</span>
amendments in those areas should not comfort the Minister. It does not imply that we support the provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take this comfort from the amendment paper the Opposition do not seek to amend the detailed proposals for whole areas of Scotland. Of course, they may table other amendments, but, at present, they have not tabled any.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister did not listen to what I said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman. My point is that in relation to the islands and the highlands, to Moray, to the split of Grampian and, in principle, the splits of Tayside and Lothian, to the Borders where the Berwickshire question is outstanding, to Dumfries and Galloway, to the city of Glasgow and to Argyll and Bute, with minor amendments, the Opposition do not contest, in detail, the Government's proposals. It is significant that, through their detailed amendments, the Opposition will not seek to argue against the break up of Strathclyde, Lothian, Tayside or Grampian. They will not seek to contest the Government's principles, although I accept that they will contest the details behind those principles. Once a unitary structure is accepted, the range of choice in Scotland is limited, much more so than south of the border.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems clear that the Minister is capable of listening, but is incapable of understanding what is said. That should come as no surprise to the Committee or to the public outside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We oppose the principle of the Bill. How often must that be repeated before the Minister understands? We do not support a reorganisation that, as 	<i>The Scotsman</i> said, is based purely on the interests of the current ruling party in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As will be seen from these early amendments and from the clause stand part debate, we oppose the very principle of the reorganisation, because it is proposed on the basis of no review or independent thinking, still less on the establishment of a Scottish Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. In an earlier point of order, the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley said that the Minister was constantly repeating the same message. The hon. Gentleman took great exception to that and asked the Chair to have regard to that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that the hon. Member for Hamilton has said that Opposition Members totally oppose the Bill and its implications for the change in local government structures in Scotland, is it not the case that they constantly repeat the same arguments? We have heard those arguments in the Scottish Grand Committee, on Second Reading, and in Committee on Thursday. The Opposition are constantly carping and constantly repeating the same message. The hon. Member for Hamilton has just done the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In response to the hon. Member's lengthy point of order, I consider that, as yet, I have not
	<span class='label label-info column'>108</span>
heard anything that is out of order. I could intervene on many occasions, but, to ensure the flow of argument, I do not do so. As yet, I have not heard anything that is out of order. Despite my cold, I am listening carefully to everything that is said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I might enter the record book, Sir James, as the only speaker in the Committee who has been interrupted twice by points of order raised in the middle of interventions from me. I believe that that is neither a usual nor a frequent event. Bearing in mind the Prime Minister's memorable expression, the flapping of white coats, I never even thought that I was likely to get through to the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie). I am, however, trying to make the message clear to the Minister: we oppose the principle of reorganisation. We are using our amendments to schedule 1 to highlight the grosser inconsistencies of the Government's approach and the blatant gerrymandering behind the proposals. The Minister must not and should not comfort himself with the thought that the fact that no amendments are tabled in relation to huge areas means that we accept the overall reorganisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. Could you clarify for me whether it is in order for an hon. Member to make a point of order during an intervention?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it was not in order, I should not have allowed the hon. Member—much as I like listening to him—to have pursued his point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must say to the hon. Member for Hamilton that, of course, I accept that the Opposition oppose the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At last.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I accept that: the Opposition voted against the Bill on Second Reading. I am saying that moving from a structure of 65 authorities to a unitary structure means that the range of choice is more limited than was the case at the time of the Wheatley commission when 426 authorities were involved. I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman as long as he does not accuse me of filibustering.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As long as the Minister answers the question. He said that the reorganisation under Wheatley was major and that that was why an independent commission was needed then, but is not needed now. A major reorganisation was carried out in England under Redcliffe Maud. A similar exercise to that in Scotland is being undertaken in England, but England has a commission under Sir John Banham. Are not the arguments exactly the same?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman cites England as an obvious example to follow. I should have thought that even he would recognise that it is much better to compare Scotland with Wales than with England. There are parallels in social terms and in the numbers of authorities involved. There is no independent commission in Wales. If the hon. Gentleman is suggesting that Scotland, which is a much smaller country, should adopt the English approach of a rolling commission,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0068">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>109</span>
bringing forward representations on a rolling timetable for change, that would not be appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not suggesting anything. I asked a question to which the Minister could perhaps reply. Why is it right to have an independent commission for England which would take the issue out of the political arena and examine it independently—I believe that that is sensible—but okay for Ministers to gerrymander proposals for Scotland? That is the question that the Minister must answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not gerrymandering proposals. Let me answer the hon. Gentleman in two ways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two syllables.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that even I can get away with answering the hon. Gentleman in two syllables, but it may be helpful if I use as few syllables as I can. First, there is a rolling commission in England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An independent one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An independent rolling commission. I do not think that anyone has put that forward as a serious proposal for Scotland. The position in Scotland is much more like that in Wales, where there is no independent commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it is not for independent commissions or other bodies to decide anything. Ultimately, Parliament must decide. It is seldom realised that the structure that emerged eventually from the previous reorganisation was quite different from that proposed by the Wheatley commission. That is not a criticism of Wheatley but, ultimately, Parliament must decide. The changes to which Parliament agreed were not minor. The original Wheatley proposals were for seven regions and 37 districts in Scotland. The legislation provided for nine regions, 53 districts and three island councils, which showed a marked difference from the original proposals. The idea that an independent commission eliminates controversy and creates consensus and that Parliament does not have a say is nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I am about to finish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point concerns the Government's justification for not having a commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I have already answered the hon. Gentleman three times and I am just about to finish. I know that other hon. Members want to speak. Ultimately, it is for Parliament to decide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point about the amendments to schedule 1, which seems to have irritated Opposition Members, is that in areas in Scotland there does not appear to be controversy about the Government's proposals. The controversy is related to a relatively small number of areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will reject the amendment. It would be nonsense to have a prolonged period of uncertainty for Scottish local government, which is what
	<span class='label label-info column'>110</span>
the Opposition's proposals would mean in practice. That cannot be in the interests of Scottish local government, its employees or those who depend on the services of Scottish local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have resisted the temptation to jump up and down to make interventions. I have listened attentively to what the Minister said and I support the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that you, Sir James, will be able to negotiate a better Committee Room in which to conduct proceedings. Cameras should be present because the people of Scotland want to see the debate. If they had seen some of the performances this morning, particularly that of the Minister and his back-up team—the serious actors and the fools playing their game—they would know that they are badly represented by the Conservative party in the Committee and that their interests are not being looked after.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I became anxious when the Minister spoke about Parliament's role because he suggested that he was willing to meet anyone who had a case to give him and that, if he like a part of the case, it would be used in the debate—for frivolous reasons—as long as it supported the Government's premise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in Committee to debate the Bill's proposals at length and to change them where that would be useful. The amendment is useful as it would permit time to examine what the Government are proposing. I may discuss the question of transition later, but the main aspects of the changes require more time than is proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great deal has been said about the Wheatley commission. What worries me is that much of it has been disparaging.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would like to correct himself. In no way did I disparage or have I disparaged the commission's work. My point was that Parliament, perfectly reasonably, took a view that was different from that of the commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note that the Minister spoke about conclusions on the boundaries. He cited the example of how many councils would be covered by the boundaries and what size they would be. I hope that he does not dispute the principles on which the commission's conclusions were founded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was a university student, I studied the Boundary Commission report in detail and closely examined costs and practicalities. The 1969 report reads just as well today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend was very young.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As Bob Dylan said, "I was older then, I am so much younger now."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report's principles have stood the test of time and are sound. They should have informed the Government when the Bill was being prepared. I hope that we can persuade the Government to accept the amendment to allow more time to examine and focus on the major principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929 dealt with a different set of responsibilities. The Wheatley
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0069">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>111</span>
commission had to examine how to form local government to deal with new functions and services. The functions and services have not changed greatly since. The Bill's proposals are not founded on the same principles as those behind the commission's report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An excellent House of Commons Library research paper—"Local Government Reorganisation In Scotland"—was produced in July 1993. On page 5, the principles of forming a local authority were discussed. The paper states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Each local authority ought to be functionally viable, i.e. capable of sustaining, both administratively and financially, the responsibilities laid upon it".</p></blockquote>
That principle is being destroyed by the oddities of the proposals in schedule 1 and the rest of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of services, the research paper states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The structure of local government should be as uniform and self-consistent as can be achieved".</p></blockquote>
That is not offered by the Bill. We should give ourselves some time and, during that transitional period, look at ways of getting those principles and those service functions correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One problem that Wheatley identified and one that has taxed us greatly, is that of reconciling the bigger local government units with grass roots democracy. Therein lies the kernel that led the Government to come forward with the proposals in the Bill. That has always been a problem. I served in local government as a leader of a council for 10 years and I was chair of the local government committee of the Labour party in Scotland. We wrestled with the problems of getting a local government structure, after the establishment of a Scottish Parliament, that would resolve that difficulty. The Government may be persuaded to focus on that during the transition period. The people of Scotland will decide, ultimately, because there will be a general election if the amendments are accepted. They will choose between the Government's structures and those put forward by the Labour party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is making a very reasoned speech. What interests me is that he says that the amendment is about the transitional period whereas the hon. Member for Fife, Central said that it was not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister if he is trying to say that there is some difference between myself and my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central. I do not think that there is. Whether we talk about it in a transitional period or in terms of the final democratic solution, when the Bill will be swept away by the passage of time because the democratic process will come into play, is splitting a hair so finely that it does not really matter. If we have time, the Bill will not go through. If we have time, people will choose a Government who will treat them and their local government services in a much more reasonable way than the Government will ever do. The Bill is fraught with such difficulties that it will cause great confusion and the loss of services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important not to dismiss the idea of an independent commission so lightly. It is nonsensical to say that just because Wales is not having one, Scotland should not
	<span class='label label-info column'>112</span>
have one. The argument turns the other way; just because England is having one, it does not mean that every other country should have one. It has to be based on a sound principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While the hon. Gentleman is elaborating on the advantages of having an independent royal commission of some kind, would he also elaborate on the powers that a Scottish Parliament, as envisaged by the Opposition Front Bench, would have? How would that fit in with an examination of local government and the powers of a Parliament relative to this place? Would he include the powers of a Scottish Parliament in that inquiry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The idea of having a Scottish Parliament is fundamental to a balanced democracy. I will touch later on democracy and where the Scottish Parliament fits in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must look at the principles that do not seem to be behind the Bill. I said on Second Reading that it seems to lack a principled structure. Wheatley concluded that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Local government exists to provided services or exercise 	<i>functions."</i></p></blockquote>
That commitment is probably seriously breached by the structure of the Bill, it is about gerrymandering the boundaries so that the Government think they have some advantage for their party in certain areas and have little regard for the consequences for other areas where these little Bantustans for Toryism will be carved out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My study of history has shown me that that is never likely to be the outcome. When something is set up for one purpose, democracy has a strange way of turning it into a disadvantage. Those very Bantustans will reveal the flaws in the Tory logic of how local government services should be provided in a minimalist way. It will destroy their credibility entirely and with it the credibility of the Minister who introduced it. I do not want to see that outcome if it means we have to go through the tortuous transition to bad and poorly delivered services, which will lead the people of Scotland to conclude that the Tories have sold them short.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the principles of Wheatley, local government functions must be exercised over suitable areas. The suitable areas that we see on the maps are so much of a joke that television cameras should be covering our proceedings. When we discuss schedule 1, people outside should see how much of a joke the proposals are. The Minister and his hon. Friends will have difficulty in justifying their support for the carving out here and there, which has been done to try to create safe havens for themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wheatley is also based on the principle that functions and areas have to be brought together to form authorities. The Bill will bring together authorities and boards. The structure proposed does not allow authorities to carry out functions. In Stirling, 11 out of the 14 functions of local government will have to be performed by joint boards. That totally contradicts the principles of Wheatley.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wheatley also suggested that there should be wide areas for planning, personal social services, housing, police and fire services and so on. That principles breaks down with the small authorities that the Bill proposes. One of the biggest idiocies of the Bill is the attempt to create little fiefdoms. When it is compared to the standards of good
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0070">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>113</span>
government, the Bill does not appear in a good light. The people of Scotland should be told that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have tried to consider services in Scotland. The Stodart committee examined services and decided to move some of them from regions to districts and others from districts to regions. Tourism is one example. The proposals in the Bill, however, are contrary to those in the Stodart report, which took tourism from the regions and gave it to the districts because it felt that function could be run more easily as a local service. For example, I was the financial controller of the Loch Lomond, Stirling and Trossachs tourist board. It did vey well, but now there is a proposal for seven boards. I believe that Stodart did a good job, but those ideas are being tossed out on the whim of a Minister and a civil servant. Obviously, they have not read the Stodart committee report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also concerned about the lack of rigour in the methodology used by the Government when they consider costs. We have already held a debate on costs, but we should underline the need for an independent commission. Such issues should not be done by hiring a consultant who will borrow someone's watch to tell him the time. That is what has happened with costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also fear that the Minister's attitude lacks rigour. The Minister has displayed much flippancy in the debates and if that is his parliamentary role, and if that were seen by the public, it would devalue their opinion of what happens in Committee. We tell the public that the real work of the House takes place in Committee, but all we have heard is a series of flippant points and interventions that have been designed to extend the Minister's speech. That attitude contradicts the one that he adopts when he meets delegations. He appears to treat them seriously and he and his civil servants read with rigour and respect the material with which they have been provided at public expense. Those points are trivialised in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we had time to consider the proposals, we could seriously examine issues such as the community councils that are covered by clause 22. Wheatley got them badly wrong and they have staggered along since. Well-minded, positive-minded people have worked hard in the communities, but, at every turn, they feel they are valued less by the local authorities to which they speak. If we could get that right, it would lead to a great improvement in lcoal government in Scotland. If the amendment were carried, we would have the time to deliver that improvement and the transition period would be effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 23 covers decentralisation schemes. I spent 10 years in local government attempting to introduce a Going-Local strategy. People have spoken about going local and my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South (Mr. McMaster) did that in Renfrew when he brought in a scheme of local democracy to get local people involved. That forms a fundamental part of the submission from Central regional council. That scheme is well under way. It is not something for the future, but now. Such schemes would have been enough for a royal commission—the task of putting democracy where we keep saying it should be; where people live, and where their services are provided. Those spheres of responsibility are best dealt with through subsidiarity—the new word that we use for the practice of giving people power where they can use it. The power need not rise above a certain level. That is something that any commission should examine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>114</span>
Some of the Bill's proposals frighten me, because they are so contrary to the Wheatley commission's proposals. For example, there is a proposal for a form of voluntary structure planning by which people would get together voluntarily and decide to adopt a structure plan. That is not likely to happen, because a structure plan is often the one laser beam that shines through a dispute about a parochial planning matter, providing an overview to prevent people looking after their own interests without regard to those of the wider community. That should be dealt with by a royal commission, if the amendment is passed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A shambles is proposed for the tourism industry in Scotland, which will cause chaos. A royal commission would tackle that problem. I believe that the Government will be found wanting if they do not permit the extended transition period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will be in difficulty over the proposals unless they allow a longer period for their examination, and for the exercise of the democratic process—making a choice about whether the Government have got matters right in Scotland. That is not a question for the people of Scotland alone—or, if it is, it will still interest the people of England and Wales. A shambles is developing in those countries, too, as hon. Members who represent Somerset and Dorset threaten to rebel against the local government proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If an independent commission visits one area and does one thing, then visits another and does something different, appearing to shift its principles, chaos will ensue. That was not what Wheatley did, and I argue that a commission with the rigour that we should expect would not produce that result either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A set of principles could be established—and the principles of Wheatley are still very sound and in need of little amendment—to afford a new view of the local government structure in Scotland. That would enable the main question to be dealt with—how can grass roots democracy feed through local government structures? That issue taxed the relevant Labour party committee that I chaired. It probably also taxed the civil servants who genuinely wanted to respond to the problem in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals for water are themselves worthy of a commission. The water industry in Scotland has massive problems. I know from briefings and from my own acquaintance with the subject that billions of pounds of investment are needed in the water industry. Labour Members would argue that that should be undertaken within a local government framework. Taxes should be levied for it. No profit should be made from it. People would have to accept the need to pay local taxes to obtain a good quality water service. That is our principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government would advocate privatisation, but were chased away from that approach by the massive reaction of the people in Scotland. More than 25,000 people in my constituency signed postcards and letters against it. I and the hon. Member for Falkirk, West (Mr. Canavan) took those to the Scottish Office and we gave them to the Minister to add to the 150,000 others that he had received on the subject. That reaction dissuaded the Government from the idea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0071">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>115</span>
The two notions about the future management of the water industry are at different ends of the spectrum. A royal commission that includes a technical element is needed to give serious thought to the problems of Scottish water. We want good water and sewerage services in Scotland to continue. We think that that aim can be achieved in the public sector. The Government think that it would be better tackled in the private sector. A comprehensive technical solution is not available. The matter is to be cast among quangos which will be allowed to make all the decisions. We have come to believe—as have the people of Scotland and anyone who applies common sense to the matter—that the way to deal with it is not by hastily bringing into being the structures set out in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to end my remarks with some comments on democracy, which is the most fundamental aspect of the issue. Local democracy has underpinned Wheatley and everything that has taken place in local government in Scotland for 150 years. Its influence extends as far back as the royal burghs, which were designed to give people some power over structures in their own area. If that is supposed to be the way in which local government works, why have so many proposals for joint boards been made? The services of Central region, for example, cannot be run with Stirling standing alone. It must join somewhere else to form administrative and quasi-democratic mechanisms. Our water industry will be put out entirely to appointed persons. The Minister and his hon. Friends are walking over local democracy in their hob-nailed boots. That is a great shame.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I served in local government for 13 years, 10 of them as leader, not necessarily for party reasons. The people who served alongside me were Conservative and Labour. The Scottish National party was represented for a brief period. The hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) was my predecessor in the Cornton ward in Stirling. I took the seat from the SNP, which was represented for three years but disappeared and, I am glad to say, did not come back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After elections, representatives worked together for local people. They often regretted the fact that structures were not right and they made mistakes. However, they tried to do things correctly because they felt that they had a democratic duty to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Bill is forced through, it will force the return of joint boards in a way that would remove people from direct responsibility. How will people on joint boards take a broad overview when they know that their democratic ticket is to represent the small part of the joint board that is their council? It is bad enough being a local councillor trying to balance the needs of a district or a region and worrying about the effect on a ward. Many a good member has lost his ward seat by standing up for the principle of what is best for all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any councillor whose council is on a joint board must think not only of his ward, but of the politics of the council. That is a fundamental flaw in the Bill. The Government, and Scotland's people, will rue the day when or if the Bill becomes law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point is about broad democracy and the questions of a Scottish Parliament and the sort of
	<span class='label label-info column'>116</span>
restructuring that is needed. I shall not back away from the fact that restructuring is necessary. The committee that I sat on stated that it was likely that people would gain from a Scottish Parliament with a single tier of local government below it. I do not apologise for that. It is the conclusion of many experts and political advisers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there will be no chance for the people to decide. Regardless of all the numbers nonsense, the people of Scotland did not choose the Conservative structure of local government. In Scotland, the Government said that they would have unitary authorities. The Conservative party was not elected in Scotland on that basis. It failed to gain more than 25 per cent. of the vote and more than 11 out of 72 Members in Scotland. That should have been a lesson that it had to come forward with a compromise. However, a compromise is not before the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendments were passed, there would be time for a general election to be called. Then, the people would give their judgment, which would be that the Government are wrong, the Minister is wrong and the Bill is wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to follow the hon. member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty). His remarks were interesting because, like any hon. Member who came to the House straight from local government, he speaks from having recently been in the driving seat. However, he and his hon. Friends are skating around the Bill's two critical aspects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, local government—if it is to be restructured in whatever way—must be changed in as short a time scale as is viable so that uncertainties for those who work in local government may be removed. I may not have had the experience of the hon. Member for Falkirk, East in local government, but I have had experience of changing large organisations substantially and dramatically. The earlier that changes are put through in a viable time scale, the better the chance of removing the uncertainties. The amendment does not address that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the amendment conveniently walks round the question of Labour's flagship—the creation of a Scottish Parliament. The real issues are not addressed. What powers, duties and responsibilities would such a Parliament have? Until that question is addressed, the duties, authorities and responsibilities of local government—the other tier—cannot be dealt with properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour Members have walked away from macro-economics, a single currency, a single bank and economic planning. I make no apology for drawing attention to that because, for most of my time in Parliament, I have been concerned with the constitution and its impact on those issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot discuss a Scottish Parliament without dealing with such matters. I expect the hon. Member for Linlithgow to discuss them honestly and objectively, as he does always. I do not say that disparagingly because I admire the hon. Gentleman's integrity. I hope that he understands that I bring him into the discussion because I believe that he, like me, is prepared to stand against constitutional issues that he believes to be wrong, about which he cares deeply and for which he is prepared to incur the wrath of his party, as I am of mine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Parliament from which Opposition Members are walking away. Hon. Members representing English constituencies are worried about an aspect of the proposal for a Scottish Parliament on which the Labour party is not clear—namely, Scottish representation at Westminster. The Labour party should tell us whether it proposes to reduce the number of Scottish Members at Westminster and, if so, which hon. Members propose to sit in a Scottish Parliament rather than sit at Westminster. I believe that the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) has gone on record to say that he would. Would the hon Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson)? Would the right hon. and learned Member for Monklands, East (Mr. Smith) return to Monklands to deal with the appalling administrative nightmare in that part of Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Member for Tayside, North will not divert his attention to that issue. We should not be debating, in that sense, a Scottish Parliament and the problems associated with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You too, Sir James, are greatly interested in the constitution and will recognise that when Opposition Front-Bench Members declare that their amendments are not wrecking amendments, but are designed to delay implementation of the Bill within a certain time scale, they believe that that would give them the opportunity of having a general election and the probability of establishing a Scottish Parliament. We should discuss powers because the Bill deals with the structure, powers and responsibilities of the new local government. We cannot discuss those issues if Opposition Members say constantly that they object to the Bill because, under their alternative proposals, there will be a Scottish Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every Opposition Member will refer to a Scottish Parliament. I hope that I am in order in mentioning that, Sir James. In the Bill the Government have made clear that there is a desire and an urge to have unitary all-purpose authorities in Scotland. There seems to be a general consensus on that. The Labour party says that that requires a Scottish Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have considered the matter on the basis of their not being a Scottish Parliament because we believe that Scotland does not want a Parliament. We certainly do not want a Parliament for which the powers and responsibilities have not been spelt out clearly. Who does what, who pays for what and what must be given away to reach that stage have not been clarified. The House will not pass legislation that gives powers to a Scottish Parliament, that takes powers away from this House, without some give and take.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seemed to empathise with my comments. Therefore, does it worry him that this proposal is the only one to rejig local government? There is no other body—for example, a Scottish Parliament—to adjudicate on the matter. This is the final attempt. It will create many joint boards and de-democratise the process of local government in many areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman will discover, I am no great lover of quangos. Let us suppose that unitary, all-purpose, authorities might be achieved without a
	<span class='label label-info column'>118</span>
Scottish Parliament. I oppose the establishment of a Scottish Parliament. I have never left anyone in doubt about where I stand on that issue. Indeed, I agree with the hon. Member for Linlithgow. We believe that it is unworkable, and that it would destroy the United Kingdom. The hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) holds the clear view that independence is wanted. I understand that, although I do not understand how it is sometimes dressed up; that is fraudulent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When it is said that independence is wanted, and only that, I understand that, but I have a difficulty. Let us consider the powers and responsibilities within the United Kingdom. This Parliament must make the judgment and decisions on what powers and responsibilities can be given. Eighty three per cent. of the population live in England. Therefore, this Parliament will have to persuade the majority of the electorate that the deal relating to powers, responsibilities and accountability in Scotland is acceptable. That is democracy as I understand it and as it quite properly functions in this House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot accept that the hon. Member for Falkirk, East claims that, as we are restructuring local government in Scotland, it could not and should not be done without an independent royal commission. Does that mean that if we are to have a Scottish Parliament that could be established only following an independent royal commission which clearly determined the powers and responsibilities and what that Parliament would be capable of doing? That is the logic of the Opposition's arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition talk about principles and logic. The logic is that if their approach is right and proper—and they believe genuinely and sincerely in it—and that is the only way to restructure local government and to determine the powers, responsibilities, accountability and the areas of responsibility in every sense, including geographic areas, then that must equally apply to establishing a Scottish Parliament. If that is their argument, they may find that I could be an ally. Certainly, I should not object to a royal commission inquiring into the costs in real terms, as well as in democratic and financial terms, of establishing such a body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is banging on about power and responsibility. An elected Scottish Parliament would have the power that is currently vested in the Scottish Office and also the democratic responsibility flowing from election by the Scottish people. Surely that is in marked contrast to the power without responsibility exercised in the Scottish Office, which is, of course, the prerogative of the Tory throughout the ages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have always thought that the hon. Gentleman, with his background, has a rather romantic view of the real world, and now he has convinced me. One cannot expect this or any other Committee simply to say that it will hand over powers to a Scottish Parliament, without that being examined in detail by the majority of the people in these islands, who happen to live in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot ignore the interests of the majority. While I, as a Scot, will always argue in the best interests of Scotland and fight my corner for Scotland, I have never believed that it is viable to tell those with 83 per cent. of the equity that we shall have our way regardless, even
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0073">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>119</span>
though we have less than 9 per cent. of the equity. That is what the hon. Gentleman's comments mean.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part of the reason why the Scottish Office has its powers and responsibility is the recognition that within this unitary Parliament and the United Kingdom, we have a single currency, a single bank and a single economy. They can be kept in balance either by moving money from the wealthy areas to the poor areas or by moving people from the poor to the wealthy areas. That is how it works. If the hon. Member for East Lothian is proposing that a Parliament is established in Scotland that is not accountable to this House—that is what the hon. Gentleman said in effect—and that powers are transferred to Edinburgh so that the Scottish Parliament has complete freedom to make decisions without taking into account views on macro-economics, which are vital to the running of a unitary state, he is living in cloud cockoo land. That will not and cannot happen. It is unworkable and the hon. Gentleman for Linlithgow will explain why because he, as I have, has written about what is viable. The hon. Member for East Lothian with his romantic notions should return to his grand estate in the borders to live the romantic life that goes with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sure that we are all anxious to learn more about the hon. Member for East Lothian, but the hon. Member should return to consideration of the Bill. I have given hon. Members much latitude because we are in the early part of our long consideration of the Bill. However, it is now time to deal with the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir James, for your understanding and tolerance. I am sure that the Committee respects as I do, your unique position within this Parliament. You are one of the real democrats. It is never easy to be in a party of one in which minority interests must always be taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am loth to stop the lauding of the Chairman, with which I totally agree. However, as well as returning to consideration of the amendments, will the hon. Gentleman consider my question? He appears to have ducked it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill contains the only proposals before us at present. Despite the hon. Gentleman's assertions, that may be different in future. Will he answer my points about the growth of quangos and joint boards and about the destruction of democracy that is inherent in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to trangress further, but I must tell the hon. Gentleman what I said earlier. We shall come to those aspects later and I shall make my contribution on other issues when we reach them. The hon. Gentleman can be assured of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is usually very careful with his words. Earlier, he said that he was no lover of quangos. Does that include the three water boards? Does he oppose their creation or is his opposition to quangos selective?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will have quite a bit to say about them later because I have an interest. It is called north Tayside.
	<span class='label label-info column'>120</span>
The water supply for most of Tayside is located in my constituency. Therefore, I have direct interest and I do not apologise for that. It is my duty to consider that matter and I promise the Committee that I shall do so, but not at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are about delay. Reference has properly been made to structure plans and the earlier that decisions are made about them, the better. I was lobbied this week by the director of planning of Perth and Kinross district council, which deals with an area in the west of my constituency. He said, "If nothing else, Bill, make sure that they understand that we want decisions on structure plans as soon as possible. Frankly, we cannot get on with doing our job properly until there is agreement about them."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware of the views of the Scottish Society of Directors of Planning? Its chairman, Alan White, stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government has made no case for reorganising Local Government."</p></blockquote>
That is the considered view of the directors of planning and certainly of a previous officer of the society, Gordon Mann, of Dumfries and Galloway, whom the Minister, the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro), knows well. There has been deep criticism of the proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am prepared to quote the director of planning from Perth and Kinross who has spoken directly to me. Perth and Kinross district council's policy is clean it supports the creation of a unitary authority based on Perth and Kinross. I shall do everything that I can during the Bill's passage to ensure that the views of the council and its officers become fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until the Opposition are prepared to address their alternative proposals adequately, we will look with cynicism on the question of whether to delay the implementation of the time scale laid down in the Bill. If the Opposition cannot tell us objectively, honestly and fully their proposals for a Scottish Parliament, it is nonsense to talk about the structure and powers of local government or to delay the Bill because they want time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make a brief contribution. I have put my name to the amendment for a specific purpose. The hon. Member for Tayside, North will forgive me if I do not follow him down the avenue of a Scottish Parliment. He has been rehearsing his well-known views, if not prejudices, for some time and at least has a consistent position on the subject. However, I was not born yesterday. If the Government are in trouble with a weak case, their tactic is to attack the Opposition. That is not what the Committee is about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee should tease out from the Government what is behind the Bill. I hoped that the amendment would have occasioned a debate that would have enabled the Government to put on record the background to the development of their policy and state why it was unnecessary to think again. The amendment, whether wrecking, transitional or anything else, gives the Committee the chance to take time to examine what is being embarked upon before it considers the detail of schedule 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making a reasonable point, but the hon. Member for East Lothian

referred specifically to the relationship between a Scottish Parliament and changes in local government. It was right and proper for my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North to respond.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not complaining that there have been discussions about a Scottish Parliament. Alternatives have to be examined. My party has a well developed policy for a Scottish Parliament, some of which gets it off the hooks upon which others may have impaled themselves when discussing the relationship between a Scottish Parliament and the House, the reduction in the number of hon. Members that would be necessary and the functions of the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point to the Minister—which will prevail for the rest of the Committee's proceedings—is that he spent only a fraction of his speech doing what I hoped that he might. I was disappointed about that. Of course he has to deal with talk of a Scottish Parliament. I have no problem with that. However, our proceedings will be read far and wide, beyond the confines of this Room. The Minister has a duty during our proceedings to make clear what the Government intend to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the most difficult tasks for the Government is to sustain the argument. I have looked carefully, as I am sure other hon. Members have done, at all the information available through the two consultative processes. Speaking for my party, we were quite happy to go along with the first round of consultation which produced the idea of a unitary authority. I am comfortable with that. Some of the ways in which the unitary principles have been applied are perfectly acceptable. However, some leave a tremendous amount to be desired.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second round of consultation leaves me with the suspicion that the whole Government prospectus and the provenance of the Bill were driven by boundaries. That may or may not be right, but the Government have a duty to allay our suspicion that that is all there is to the Bill. They must allay our fears about the rest of the spatchcock, cobbled together bits of legislation which will create difficulties in future, certainly in the areas of service deliveries. There will be enormous problems in trying to make the service functions that are contained in the latter stages of the Bill work. The Minister has a job to do to put a coherent thread to the arguments behind the Bill. To put it to him in a cheeky way, he will have to do better in future than he did this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must deal with some of the points that have been raised, but he must also set out the Government's stall. He spent only a few minutes doing that at the end of his speech. He talked about the differences between the current context of reform and Wheatley. That is a valid point. We should spend some time considering that. I had hoped that the Committee would spend more time doing that than it has. The context is very different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are right to say that there may not be as many amendments on the geographical areas in schedule 1. However, if the Government think that contentment pervades the length and breadth of the highlands about their plans, they are quite wrong. There is
	<span class='label label-info column'>122</span>
no amendment about the Highland region simply because the Opposition feel that, as there are no highlands Members on the Committee, it is better to deal with the problem later when they can have a chance to argue the case for themselves. The Minister may say that that is not the right way to proceed, but he should not infer from the fact that there is a relatively small number of amendments compared with the previous reform that everyone is content with everything that the Government are doing. That is certainly not the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not drawing that conclusion. I was simply referring to the areas where the official Opposition had, at this stage in our proceedings at least, proposed alternatives. Can I perhaps reassure the hon. Gentleman that I have agreed to meet a delegation from the Association of Highland District Councils which will be led by the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for Falkirk, East. The Minister has been diligent in the Department in seeing individual delegations. Where the Government have been signally deficient is in trying to set out some kind of prospectus of what they are trying to achieve with this local government reform. Until the Minister does that, and I am beginning to repeat myself, we will all suspect that this is all boundary driven. That makes the Government's position even more untenable when it comes to the lack of an independent commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there had been an independent commission, the Minister would have had a defence. He could even have said, "We have studied the reports of the independent commission, but nevertheless, for the following 16 reasons, we have decided to do it our way." That would have been fine. We should have seen the independent commission's evidence, analysis, philosophy and background approach, and been able to compare it with the Government's response, and drawn our own conclusions. All that we have at the moment is a scanty, almost casual approach to the changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no substance to the argument and that makes it difficult for Opposition Members, or anybody with an interest in the Bill, to grasp the Government's aims. We should spend some time during the Committee's proceedings examining our respective ideas of the purpose of local government. I think it mad to consider changes piecemeal. I do not see the Bill as a piecemeal measure—it is a fundamental reform. However, we are not really considering the functions in conjunction with finance and geographical areas. It seems mad to me that we do not consider them all of a piece. The financing of local government is an integral part of the provision of local government services. However, the Bill does not deal with any of that. We have no idea—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>123</span>
we did not devote five or six sittings to an investigation as to fact? Far from attacking the hon. Gentleman from behind, I am deeply sympathetic to his argument, which is profoundly true. The first people whom we should have invited to give evidence are the chief executives and the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives. Whereas it may be true that that society is resigned to the date fixed upon, I understand that it is deeply opposed to the entire undertaking, that is, the whole Bill. Certainly, in the next few days we shall ask the society for its view of the Minister's comments when he gave the impression that it was content. My understanding is that it is far from content and that we should have asked its representatives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I should certainly have been reassured if we had been able to take evidence during two or three sittings. I should have been able to clear my mind on certain points that still deeply trouble me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as I can tell, we are considering 87 or 88 different powers, ranging from roads and eduction to some of the less strategic, but nevertheless important functions. We are also in danger of creating a multi-tiered authority by default. It shines through from the legislation that the Secretary of State is arrogating to himself unprecedented levels of enabling powers. I suspect that that is because he may need a residuary sweep-up power, because everything else may collapse in his hands. In addition to that level of power, there will also inevitably be joint borders all over the country, which will be unsatisfactory. As well as the council level, there will be a decentralised level, not to mention the community councils. That is supposed to be a clarified structure, which will enable people to know which door they should knock on to get problems sorted out. I am deeply sceptical about it and I need persuasion and reassurance.

Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood), I must mention that I have clear expectations of the Bill. I expect it to provide a degree of local authority representation with which people can identify at a local level. On that basis, I consider it quite understandable that, to a great extent, the Bill is boundary driven. However, other issues must be considered. The Bill tackles those issues. As we progress, detail will be added to the meat. It is no coincidence that schedule 1 appears early in the Bill. That gives the hon. Gentleman's words some standing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, everyone is interested in whether the hon. Member for Ayr has been authorised by the Minister to say that the Bill is boundary driven. The comment puts the measure in perspective—it is a pyramid standing on its point—it will fall over. Why, if boundaries are driving the Bill, does it not propose several authorities that are the same size as Ayr or south Ayrshire?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman does not rise to speak without permission from the hon. Member for Hamilton, who checks every word before it is delivered. I have had no contact with the Minister on the point that we are considering. I have used my words and expressed
	<span class='label label-info column'>124</span>
my understanding of the issues. I made similar submissions to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland when he consulted people about the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we consider the sizes of the authorities that the Bill will establish, it is right that debate should take place. I shall table amendments to try to ensure that people whose views are not represented by their Members of Parliament are expressed. I am prepared to table amendments to tease out—in the words of the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire—the details of the measure, and ensure that the interests of some areas are taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I have had enough of the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Lothian said that no feelings against Strathclyde region had been expressed. I am the only Member in the House of Commons who has served as a councillor in Ayrshire, which is part of Strathclyde. A lot of misunderstanding, anger and resentment existed because councillors in Glasgow could affect to such an extent the local affairs of people in Ayrshire and in my patch. There are strong feelings in my constituency that Strathclyde should go. I shall give the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire one or two examples to back that assertion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For years, money has been made available from the Scottish Office to Strathclyde region for providing sewerage facilities, which would and should have benefited my constituents. That money has not been directed to Ayrshire, that which has caused dissatisfaction with Strathclyde region.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will forgive me for being puzzled. I always go to Ayrshire with trepidation. I asked Richard Jenner, who contacted us on behalf of Kilmarnock and Loudoun district council, about his relations with Strathclyde. They had been good. For whom is the hon. Gentleman speaking—Ayr council and who else?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I speak for my constituents and for those who were my constituents when I was a district councillor. I offer views expressed in Cunninghame district. Perhaps I represent the views of the people of Kilmarnock and Loudoun.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am answering a senior member of the Opposition. The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley should show some courtesy to senior members of his party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Linlithgow had journeyed into Ayrshire recently, he would have found difficulty in reaching the area by road. That is another major complaint of my constituents about Strathclyde. Road provision has not been in keeping with our expectations. The Bill suggests that the changes will be of great benefit to local needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I always respect my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow. I am a constituent of the hon. Member for Ayr.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the hon. Gentleman vote for him?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not mad. I talk to many of the hon. Gentleman's constituents as I travel round Ayr and I do not find the contempt for Strathclyde that he mentions. I find real anger at the secret meeting of Kyle and Carrick district council with Spanish organisations on opting out. Even greater anger is expressed by his constituents, who use my constituency as a playground and an opportunity for recreation, at the hon. Gentleman's inability to criticise the appalling Scottish Power proposals on pylons. His constituents know that the hon. Gentleman represents not them, but Scottish Power, which pays him a substantial amount of money. That, and not concern about Strathclyde, is causing anger in Ayr.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I may have misunderstood him, but I know that the hon. Gentleman is not making an allegation that the hon. Member for Ayr is in receipt of money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is in the Register of Members' Interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I hope that hon. Members will not make any allegations about other hon. Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. Of course, I should not make unfounded allegations against an hon. Member. I was saying that the people of Ayr are furious at the inability of their Member of Parliament to speak out against the Scottish Power proposals on pylons because he is one of its paid consultants. That is recorded in the Register of Members' Interests. The hon. Gentleman gets money, a car and private health care from Scottish Power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is one thing to point out that an hon. Member is a consultant, which he declares in the Register of Members' Interests, but it is another matter to allege that judgment is affected because of the receipt of money. We must get on with the debate—we have only 16 minutes before we adjourn for lunch.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I trust that you will allow me to respond to the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, Sir James. I am used to such slurs from him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. In view of your comments, is not it right that the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley should apologise to my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr and withdraw his remarks?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have said, I did not quite hear what he said. I have no doubt that when 	<i>Hansard</i> is available, or after I receive further information, the matter may be raised again. As far as I am concerned, it is now at an end and I want the debate to proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir James. 	<i>Hansard</i> will show that the hon. Gentleman suggested that my judgment was affected by my openly declared involvement in Scottish Power. I make it clear to the Committee, as I have in the past, that that is not so. If the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley wants to know my feelings about the Scottish Power pylons, I am prepared openly to
	<span class='label label-info column'>126</span>
identify with the Scottish Trades Union Congress campaign to boost the Scottish economy and Scottish jobs. I have not done so in this instance because I respect the interests of people in my locality—most of whom live in the constituency of the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley—and have stayed out of the argument. I shall continue to do so but if forced to enter it, I shall make clear my views, as they are made clear to every constituent who writes to me about the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I know the hon.

The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley commented on Kyle and Carrick district council and made a specific reference to a meeting held on a Sunday which his spouse—an elected member of the council—attended. At that meeting, the future and the likely responsibilities of the single-tier local authority were discussed. The principal speaker at that meeting was, as I understand it, a paid-up member of the Labour party. That the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley can refer to secret meetings with Kyle and Carrick district council is another example of the type of distorted statement regularly uttered by him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is far too modest. He brings to the Committee vast experience in hydro-electric power generation, in which industry he occupied a senior managerial position. It is quite wrong—and I hope that my hon. Friend agrees—for other hon. Members to lay stress on their experiences in whatever sectors they worked in and then immediately to dismiss my hon. Friend's experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The subject of hon. Members' interests seems to be to the fore. Has my hon. Friend read the interests of the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, who seems to be sponsored by Co-operative Press Ltd.? Can my hon. Friend speculate on whether that places the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley in any difficulty, especially as he admits to occasional income from television, radio and newspapers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Far too occasional.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman also holds regular meetings just outside of the Room.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I would rather that hon. Members did not speculate any further but got on with the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sit James. I acknowledge the comments made by my hon. Friend. I was aware that the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley

	<span class='label label-info column'>127</span>
had a directorship of some kind with Co-operative Press Ltd., but it is not for me to comment upon that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Lothian spoke about the level of dissatisfaction felt in Strathclyde. In my constituency, there is gross dissatisfaction about the provision of nursery education, which is another issue affected by the Bill. The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley wants to delay the adoption of single-tier local authorities but if we can achieve that status in the not too distant future, it will greatly advantage my constituents through the provision of services such as nursery education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that speedy implementation of the Bill is important. I look to its early conclusion and to my hon. Friend the Minister to keep to his proposed dates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exploiting my seniority, I ask the hon. Gentleman to forgive me for intervening once again. We are puzzled because we all received a letter this morning from Eric Jackson, who is the chairman of the community council at Mauchline. In order to ascertain its concerns, I phoned Eric Jackson who plainly said that as far as the community council is concerned, Strathclyde has many advantages. We are entitled to think that there are differences of opinion within Ayrshire. The hon. Gentleman should not give the impression that his constituents represent the total feeling in Ayrshire. I do not doubt that he speaks for some people in Ayrshire, but I think that Eric Jackson is speaking for others, perhaps out of the borough of Ayr.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With a majority of 85, I recognise that not everyone in my constituency agrees with me. I acknowledge that there are differences of opinion, as the hon. Gentleman rightly pointed out. Mauchline does not lie within my constituency. No doubt, that is to the regret of people in Mauchline, given the standard of representation that they receive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Linlithgow has, no doubt, received letters from West Kilbride community council and others which say that they want more local authority input at their level. They have expressed some dissatisfaction with the Ayrshire local authority structure, as set out in the Bill. Once again, as a democrat, I acknowledge the strength of opinion on that and have tabled an amendment recognising such representations. I have listened to people like Mr. Jackson, although those people did not share his opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened to comments made earlier by the hon. Member for Falkirk, East who talked about the lack of Government recognition for the feelings of the Scottish people and the Government's failure to identify with their wishes in the general election. I cannot accept that. In the general election, as I understand it, the Conservatives, the Scottish Nationalists, the Labour party and the Liberal Democrats were all advancing the policy of single-tier local authorities. There was, however, a difference between the parties. The Labour party and the Liberal Democrats wanted a Scottish Assembly to be established under Westminster rule. The SNP and the Conservative party did not want such a body established. On that basis, logic suggests that the Government have achieved a
	<span class='label label-info column'>128</span>
remarkable amount of agreement on the issue. They have recognised the aspirations of the four parties for single-tier local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that this morning we heard the Opposition say that it would cost no extra to set up a Scottish Parliament? Government spending per capita in Scotland is 34 per cent. higher than in England and 26 per cent. higher than in Wales, so the Opposition, in order to balance the books, would have to reduce services drastically or significantly increase taxation in Scotland if that Assembly were established.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely correct. I fear that the Scottish Assembly would not want to reduce services and, as a consequence, would impose on the Scottish people exceptionally high additional taxation. That would not only place an additional burden on individuals, but it would put a massive burden on industry and commerce, which it would be unable to afford. That burden would not attract industrial and commercial development in Scotland and that would result in jobs being lost to Scottish people. Conservative Members feel very strongly about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that Conservative Members felt very strongly that taxes in Scotland should not be increased. Will he, therefore, tell the Committee why Conservative Members supported a tax increase of £10 a week for everyone in Scotland from next year and a tax increase of £16 a week for everyone in Scotland in the year after that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At last we have a Government who are looking to the long term, because there is a problem. If we accrue and sustain massive debts, the cost of maintaining and increasing them—if we are to increase service expenditure, as is constantly demanded by Opposition Members—would be an on-going burden on the Scottish and United Kingdom economies that they cannot afford. The recent Budget was a most un-Conservative one because it raised taxes. I am uncomfortable with that, as, I suspect, are other Conservative Members, but we look to the future and, as that debt reduces and the prosperity of Scotland and the United Kingdom begins to pick up, as indicators suggest is already happening, I should like to think that the Conservative Government can get to grips with taxation problems and start to reduce taxation once again, in line with their usual aims.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is so, why has nothing been done about equalising business rates, which already impose heavy taxation on Scottish businesses?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order Before the hon. Member for Ayr answers that question, I remind him that this Committee is not considering the Finance Bill. Hon. Members should restrict their comments to the subject under debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir James. Often in the past, when I have listened to the words of Opposition Members, I have thought that they were attempting to lead me astray. Obviously, this time, the hon. Gentleman achieved that. I apologise for being diverted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallic</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must allow me to respond to the hon. Member for Angus, East, who raised an important issue relating to the Bill's effect on the finances and financial requirements of the new local authorities and the time scale involved. I identify with the hon. Member for Angus, East, about the uniform business rate, because, like him, I have been a long-term campaigner on that issue. If the hon. Gentleman examines the figures currently available from the Scottish Office, he will see that the uniform business rate is being constantly eroded. That has not happened quick enough, but a gradual narrowing is taking place. Now, however, we have a definite date for the completion of that process and I should like to think that the single-tier structures will assist in that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>130</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The puzzle is that Les Bullock has written to us on behalf of the Ayrshire Forum of Community Council Representatives. He starts by referring to the past
	<br><blockquote><p>"twenty years of excellent services and amenities administered by Strathclyde"</p></blockquote>
but he goes on to argue the case for an all-Ayrshire authority. How is it that the secretary of the Ayrshire Forum of Community Council Representatives can talk about the excellent services and amenities administered by Strathclyde?
