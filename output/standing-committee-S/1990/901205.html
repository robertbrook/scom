	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Science (Mr. Michael Fallon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>The Committee has considered the draft Education Support Grants Regulations 1990.</p></blockquote>
May I begin by welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. Hill? I am sure that we are in safe hands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft regulations are designed to allow my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State to pay education support grants. They consolidate, with amendments, the various regulations on ESGs which have been made in the past six years under the Education (Grants and Awards) Act 1984.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may help members of the Committee if I start by explaining some of the background. In particular, I want to outline the new arrangements for combining education support grants with local education authority training grants in a single grants programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year, my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) introduced the debate on the ESG regulations for the 1990–91 programme. He explained that a review had been established as part of the efficiency scrutiny programme to consider the Department's two main specific grants—education support grants and the LEA training grants scheme. The scrutiny was to examine the administration of the two grants. That included reviewing whether they were effective instruments for supporting the policy objectives, that they were intended to support, and making recommendations for improvement. That report was published in February. It concluded:
	<br><blockquote><p>"ESGs and the LEATGS are powerful instruments for advancing the policy objectives for which they were framed. Specific grants for educational activities should continue."</p></blockquote>
The scrutiny also concluded that there was no longer a case for two separate grant systems. Instead, it recommended:
	<br><blockquote><p>"To improve efficiency and effectiveness, and to secure maximum economy of operation, a unified grant system should replace the separate ESG and LEATGS grant systems."</p></blockquote>
The report considered that such a move would improve co-ordination between training and other forms of grant support, because the two schemes, over the years have covered similar ground. In particular, it is now a key objective for both to help schools, colleges and local education authorities implement the changes resulting from the Education Reform Act 1988.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both schemes provide funds to help to put the national curriculum in place, but the training needed for the national curriculum is considered quite separately from the other forms of support needed such as books, equipment and non-teaching staff. That does not make sense. It would be better if training and support could be considered in the round, as complementary parts of a single package.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
Therefore, the Government readily accepted that bringing the two grants together would be a sensible step forward. That principle has received a general welcome, as it helps to ensure that resources are used to best effect. The scrutiny concluded that, ideally, new legislation might be introduced to provide for a single grants scheme, but it recognised that the prospect for early legislation was uncertain. Short of that, it considered that the best option would be to pay the whole of the grants progamme under the powers in the 1984 Act. That would mean allowing the statute under which training grants are currently paid—section 50 of the Education Act 1986—to lie fallow. The advice that we received from the House's authorities was that that would not be acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, for the time being, we intend to keep the two grants formally separate and paid under their respective statutes, but we will administer them side by side. That will allow us to exploit the benefits of a co-ordinated approach. The combined programme will be known as the grants for education support and training, of GEST programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ESG regulations are drawn largely on the previous ESG regulations, but they make several changes of substance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the schedule to the regulations lists all the purposes for which education support grants may be paid within the 1991–92 programme. We have taken out of the schedule the activities specified in previous schedules which are coming to an end in 1990–91. We have updated the descriptions of activities which started in previous years and are continuing into 1991–92, and we have added the new activities which will begin in 1991–92. Item 28 in the schedule covers the new activity on improving the planning and co-ordination of provision for the under-fives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the regulations will allow the Department to pay grants each term instead of quarterly, as in the past. That will bring ESGs into line with training grants, which have been paid each term for some time. That should help to reduce the administrative load. It will allow both grants to be claimed and paid at the same time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the regulations will give my right hon. and learned Friend the power to require LEAs to provide information to verify that grant has been properly paid, and to require them to comply with any requirements he may specify, including requirements on the repayment of grant. That will parallel provisions included in the new regulations governing the training grants scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To avoid confusion, I should make it clear that the power in regulation 10 about complying with requirements is only for use in the last resort. Its purpose is to ensure that my right hon. and learned Friend can protect the taxpayers' investment. In particular, it is designed to allow him to require LEAs to repay an appropriate amount of grant when they sell assets bought with ESG funding. That is a standard requirement for grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to including those points of substance, we have taken the opportunity to bring the wording of the regulations into line with the parallel training grants regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As in previous years, we have circulated a list of all the activities to be supported in the 1991–92 programme. I hope that Committee members have found it helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We announced our proposals for the size and pattern of the programme in July. We plan to support total spending of £364 million in England, of which £215 million is provisionally attributed to education support grants, and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0022">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
the remainder to training grants. The exact sums to be paid under each set of regulations will be decided once all the grant allocations to LEAs have been settled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In July, we also issued a draft circular to LEAs inviting them to submit bids for allocations under the combined GEST programme. Each activity was separately identified in the circular as payable under ESG or training grant regulations. By grouping activities together, the circular was designed to help LEAs draw up plans which treat training and other support in each activity as a single package.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The deadline for bids was 19 October. We are currently considering them with a view to deciding the final shape of the programme. We hope to announce allocations to LEAs before Christmas, subject to the draft regulations receiving approval.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's priority for the 1991–92 programme is to help schools, colleges and LEAs to implement the education reforms. Of the £364 million total programme, £270 million, or nearly 75 per cent., is being targeted on different aspects of the reforms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within that £270 million, £170 million will be allocated for projects related to the national curriculum and collective worship. They include: £35 million for implementing the new assessment procedures, which will be used to help LEAs administer the new arrangements, promote consistent assessment standards and give teachers and other staff the necessary training; £30 million for information technology systems for teaching, within which we are giving priority to primary and special schools and to supporting children with communication difficulties; £15 million for extra books for the national curriculum; and £16 million for other ESG support for materials and equipment, and for the appointment of staff such as technicians.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to supporting the national curriculum, the programme will support projects to improve the management of schools and colleges. That will particularly help schools, colleges and LEAs implement schemes of local management. More than £100 million will be available for that. It will cover expenditure on management training for staff, computerised management information systems and additional administrative support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leaves a further £90 million for activities not related to the education reforms. One of the most important of those is teacher recruitment. We are proposing to increase to £10 million the ESG support for projects to increase local recruitment of teachers, particularly former teachers and mature entrants to teaching. We shall carry on supporting projects on health education, focused particularly on alerting pupils and students to the risks associated with alcohol, smoking, drugs and AIDS. There will be continuing support for a range of ESG activities in school discipline, youth and community work and adult education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far, I have concentrated on the ESG programme in England. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales is responsible for the operation of education support grants in Wales. There, too, ESGs are being brought together with training grants in the same way as in England. The programme in Wales will support expenditure of £25 million in 1991–92. The activities to be supported closely match those in England but, in addition, funds will be available to support the study of Welsh in the national curriculum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
The value of ESGs is plain to see. The efficiency scrutiny report, which I quoted earlier, commented:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The evidence we have received, from all sources, provides overwhelming support for the two schemes. Specific grants have funded important and beneficial developments which would not have happened otherwise."</p></blockquote>
However, we recognise that we can do more. I have explained our approach to improve further the operation of ESGs and training grants. The regulations will allow ESGs to continue to provide earmarked funds to help schools, colleges and LEAs to respond to the education reforms and to other priorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.40 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Fatchett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Last year, I began by saying that on each of the three previous sittings of this Committee there had been a change of Minister. I welcome the new Under-Secretary to the Committee. I hope that he will not share the fate of his three predecessors, which, I am sure, is not related either to our debate or to the quality of my interventions. I wish the Minister well in his new post.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's opening remarks were about the need to integrate the local authority training grant system with the education support system. We support the basic principle that he stated, and we understand the procedural reasons why it is not possible to link the two schemes formally. It makes sense to administer them side by side and not to see work on teacher training for the national curriculum for instance, separately, from developments in the national curriculum that have been supported by the education support grant. We welcome these developments and look forward to the Minister announcing that that integration has worked and that further legislative steps will be taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that expenditure of £360 million was required. He sent a letter to you, Mr Hill, which I am sure you enjoyed reading in preparation for our sitting, and he kindly sent a copy of it to each Committee member. However, it might have been more helpful to hon. Members who are not as numerate as you, Mr Hill, if the amount of Government support had been shown in the tables and not just the supported expenditure. We have to alter each figure in the table by either 60 per cent. or by 70 per cent. With your gifts, Mr Hill, I know that that would be no problem, but for some of us it was a difficulty. It would be useful if a table showing the expenditure that the Government are committed to were produced in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have said that the grants have been increased. However, the increase assumes a 2 per cent. rate of inflation. Major changes may have taken place, but not substantially or quickly enough to bring that figure into line with inflation rates that are faced by local government, of 10.5 per cent. to 11 per cent. or more. Expenditure has been cut in real terms. The Minister has announced a cut in the money available for supported teacher training for the national curriculum, and for a range of other activities related to the development of schools and further education colleges. Those activities have much support on both sides of the Committee, but unfortunately the Government have reduced the real level of expenditure on them. I hope that the Minister will address those points later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Previously, local training was supported by the local authority training grants system. As the Minister will know, local authorities feel that the new system does not necessarily provide sufficient flexibility. All local
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0023">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
government recognises that central Government are responsible for laying down priorities and, through this mechanism, for funding those priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anxiety exists that some activities that are essential to the overall development of the education service—for example, the training of educational psychologists, the upkeep of educational technology centres and training for staff in further education—may not fall within the range of activities for training that will be supported by the new grant regime. That would be a disappointment as some flexibility would be lost. I hope that the Minister will have further talks with local government to ensure a system that reflects some local priorities. If the system is to work effectively, it must have a sense of central priorities and of local need and priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition have strongly criticised the Government for not proceeding with a national scheme for teacher appraisal, which is important to improve teacher morale, teacher standards and general classroom performance. A sum of money is allocated in the grants for local authorities to bid to support schemes of teacher appraisal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are rumours that, under the new Secretary of State for Education and Science, the Government will announce a nationwide scheme of teacher appraisal. If so, I welcome that. I always welcome the Government adopting Labour party policy. Is the Minister simply adopting the haphazard approach of the education support grants or the much more comprehensive system of a national teacher appraisal scheme? I fear that one of the problems of leaving the matter to individual local authorities is that, where a teacher appraisal scheme would be most needed, the local authority would be least likely to bid for the money. That is why a national scheme is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The supported level of expenditure under activity 9(91) of the table provided by the Minister is £8 million for 1991–92, although there is committed supported expenditure from the previous year of £2·1 million. That sum of £8 million represents no more than £90,000 per authority—the cost of employing probably four teachers if salary and additional employment costs are taken into account. That is not an effective response to teacher shortages or to the fact that between 350,000 and 400,000 qualified teachers, to use and often quoted figure, are not in the profession, although I believe that many would return to it if the Government took a much more active approach to recruitment and retraining. Two measures are necessary for that: first, the provision of child care facilities for the many women teachers who left the profession to assume parental and domestic responsibilities and, secondly, and perhaps more important, the introduction of refresher courses. Many teachers wish to return to work but are worried about the pace of change that has already taken place. They do not criticise it, but feel inadequate to deal with it. The money that the Government have made available for that purpose is hardly sufficient to present the image of an active campaign.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a nationwide Department of Education and Science campaign with photographs of the previous Secretary of State and film star videos. I do not recall the Minister appearing in them—perhaps he was not in office at the time. Had he been so, the programme may have been
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
more successful. I believe that a local recruitment approach, aimed at already qualified teachers, is likely to be more successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Activity 13(91) is training in the management of pupil behaviour. That is a consequence of the report of the committee chaired by Lord Elton. It suggested that there is not a major problem of behaviour in our schools but what I believe Lord Elton called a difficulty with constant disruption in many schools and the problem that teachers face in handling the disruption and dislocation that occurs in many classes. We all know from experience how difficult it is to teach effectively when such dislocation occurs. Occasionally, we see organised dislocation on the Conservative Benches in the Chamber but dislocation is not as organised in many classrooms because they do not have the benefit of Tory Whips. However, Lord Elton pointed out that there was an element of unruly behaviour and suggested that the Government should give a commitment to training teachers more effectively in the management of classrooms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For 1991–92, the Government have made available supported expenditure of £1·8 million. If my sums are right—I shall not go into the 60 per cent. calculation—that is £18,000 per local education authority, which is hardly a substantial sum to deal with the problem of unruly behaviour. They should have given this much greater priority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall finish on a point that was much in evidence in last year's debate, which I am sure the Minister has read with enthusiasm and enjoyment. He will have noticed that we ran full time on that occasion. We were blessed by a long speech from the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes), although from experience it is not possible to get any other speech from the hon. Gentleman. That was probably one of the reasons why we went full time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A matter that concerned both sides of the Committee last year was the work of the Workers Educational Association and the changes introduced to support its activities from the centre through the education support mechanism. We have read that the WEA's support is 70 per cent., rather than 60 per cent. for other grants. We were concerned that the new mechanisms would lead to an overall reduction in the WEA programme. That view was expressed by members of the Committee, in particular by the hon. Member for Banbury (Mr. Baldry), who has now gone on to greener pastures. At that stage, as he announced in Committee, he was doing an excellent job as the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the then Secretary of State for Energy. Such is the pace of change, not just in education, that I cannot work out who then was Secretary of State for Energy. However, the hon. Member for Banbury expressed anxiety about what would happen to the WEA programme in the Oxfordshire area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that it is relatively early days and that we are not far into the WEA programme, but will the Minister give us some idea how it is working, whether it is holding up nationwide and whether there are pockets within it where individual local authorities are not making the bids and it is collapsing as a result? I shall not delay the Committee further but look forward to the Minister's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eltham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What matters to working teachers is not matter whether training is supported by central Government but the knowledge that they have support in their work so that when they need retraining, extra training or guidance it is available to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now that many teachers look enviously at employees of other parts of the local government service who can take time off work for training. Teachers, especially in primary schools, have a responsibility day after day and hour after hour to give their full-time attention to children who respond well to their teaching, and most teachers know what a great job they are doing. What those teachers do not know is that other people know what a good job they are doing because, almost by definition, other people are excluded from schools and from the classroom. Some parents may go to schools and others have jobs linked to the profession, but it is an isolated profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many teachers have, in the past few years of prosperity, noticed not only how teachers' pay has improved since 1979—we need not go into that in the absence of the hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw)— but how people who were at school, college or university with them have apparently done substantially better. However, they may not have noticed the redundancies in other professions during what might be called the present recession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All of us in public service, in politics at national and local level, as Members of Parliament and councillors, have a responsibility to try to ensure that the rest of the population knows what a teacher's life is like. Clearly teachers must earn the respect of others, but if others cannot see the work that they do, we must point it out to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the appraisal of teachers, the person who has the most interest in ensuring that the struggling teacher gets help is the head teacher of the school. Perhaps we should do more to acknowledge the head teacher's role. It is important that more resources, whether they are allocated through the national grant or through normal systems of local education authority funding, reach head teachers so that they can identify experienced teachers or trainees who need extra help. There would then be a chance of achieving the results that teachers want, and standards would not be allowed to slip.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A major problem is the attitude of teachers to developments in the past two or three years. Many of them welcome the national curriculum, but most of them are appalled by the record keeping required for the assessment of pupils. I discovered yesterday when I visited Ealdham Square primary school that whereas the computer has replaced most clerical work in virtually every other sector—retail, production and commerce—teachers are expected to keep detailed manual records that no one is likely to look at again. It is ludicrous to think that, except in special cases, a receiving teacher in a secondary school will go through all the detailed records on pupils from the age of five, six or seven. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will allow me to visit Elizabeth House and be shown by a senior adviser the time that it takes for an ordinary teacher to do the assessment in the lower classes of a primary school. We can then multiply that by 30 and work out how much time is devoted to such assessment. I ask no more from my hon. Friend today than for him to arrange that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
Some of the national grants to aid local expenditure should be devoted to the excellent publications that have been produced for primary teachers, which would probably take a primary teacher about half a term to read and learn. During the first year of transition to a more regorous system, there is a multiplication of work, which will improve in the second year of the system. In the current year, we should take every opportunity to say to teachers, "We admire what you do, we recognise that you are achieving substantially more, and we recognise, above all, that the problem is not simply one of children who fail, but it used to be one of children who never experienced success." Our teachers are achieving a great deal more. There is recognition across the political divide that they need support. I hope that the grants will make it possible for them to continue to the standards that they want to achieve and that we need, and that they will get the recognition that will keep them going, even when times seem rough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ken Eastham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Manchester, Blackley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, Central (Mr. Fatchett) and I are probably the only two hon. Members present who served on the Committee of the Education Reform Act 1988. In the ever-changing political scene, it is difficult to know who is responsible for what.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's brief sounded very good and, with the support of his civil servants, put a gloss on the money that has been allocated as a result of the changes. My mind goes back to the Education Reform Act and the two or three months that I spent in Standing Committee, which was the longest running Committee since 1945. Many times we pointed out to Ministers the obvious problems that would arise from the mountainous task that was being placed upon the profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that our purpose is to merge two grants to achieve better efficiency. Whenever Governments speak of mergers, people get less funding; it is an easy way to conceal reductions. It was stated that the allocation of funds will not be inflation-proofed. The Government are making reductions in the allocation of the most-needed funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The schedule to the regulations mentions training for school governors. The Education Reform Act has led to a serious problem in the training provided for school governors. Although the Government may say that they will provide adequate training, it can be prophesied that the lack of it will be a grave problem in many cities. Under the local management of schools and other such innovations, people are being confronted with demands that were not envisaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only last weekend, my local vicar asked my wife whether she would help at one of the local high schools. Schools are having great difficulty in finding people. The demands made by Government, and the responsibilities imposed on governors, have resulted in fewer people volunteering. Being a governor is an onerous task and governors meet frequently. People do not want the responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember, during the long days and nights of the Committee stage of the Education Reform Act, that Ministers said that many people would come forward to act as governors and managers. It was emphasised that people from industry would volunteer to make schools efficient and work like clockwork, as industry is supposed to work.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0025">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
But industry does not work like clockwork. People from industry found that they could not spare the time to achieve the efficiency that education Ministers said would result from those clever people volunteering to manage schools. I have grave reservations, and expect that the Department will have to give the matter further consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister listed the goodies that would be provided by the extra money—race relations and goodness knows what else. When it comes to the crunch, it will be a thin allocation. We shall see what always happens on such occasions—a mad scramble of people fighting for their share of the money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to hear the hon. Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley) refer to the value of teachers. I wish that Conservative Members would speak more often about the value of teachers. The Government must face the fact that they do not have a good reputation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Arbuthnot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: (Wanstead and Woodford): Conservative Members—and Labour Members—are always making speeches valuing the work of teachers. The trouble is that such speeches rarely make news and are rarely reported. The more we make speeches on the subject, the less we are reported, unfortunately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eastham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take that point. Sometimes speechmaking can be empty, but teachers often ask why their value is not considered when professional salaries are being decided. It costs nothing to make fancy speeches about how good teachers are and how much they are valued. If Conservative Ms value teachers, it would be healthy for them to go through the lobby and vote for appropriate salary increases for them, which at present do not even meet inflation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I speak with some knowledge on the subject. My daughter is a deputy head in a primary school and my son-in-law is a teacher. We are talking about intelligent people who hear some of the silly, pompous speeches that are made, but if we ask teachers about their morale and whether they feel that they are valued, we hear a different story.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arbuthnot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman compared teachers' salaries under this Government compared with those under the previous Labour Government. He asks us to make speeches about the value of teachers, which we have done. He asks for increases in teachers' pay, which we have made. What does he ask us to do next?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eastham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be refreshing if increases in teachers' pay kept pace with inflation. If any Conservative Members say that teachers'salaries are keeping pace with those in industry and other professional people, I do not know where they are living—certainly not in the real world. I have listened to Ministers boasting about good rises under the Conservative Government, but I remember all the bleating that we heard about the Clegg agreement in 1979 when there was a change of Government. There was much moaning and groaning and the Government had to be dragged by the scruff of the neck to honour the Clegg award. Perhaps the hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot) was not here then, but I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
remember the period. If the hon. Gentleman looks at the records, he will find that some very strange speeches were made at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to burden the Committee by talking about the value of teachers. Lecturers, teachers and others in the teaching world know that the Government do not come out smelling of roses when they supposedly place a value on teachers' professionalism. Some of the clever and bright people ask themselves why they should carry on teaching when they can go into industry, become yuppies and be rewarded handsomely for doing half as much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Eltham, who values teachers, that teacher training is important and essential. In inner cities especially, when local authorities want to send teachers on training courses, they find that there are no replacement teachers to take over classes. Consequently, the opportunity to train is not always available for teachers. In many schools, there are more than 30 children in each class, making it, almost impossible to merge classes and thereby enable teachers to take training opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Computers were mentioned. These days, it seems to be thought that computers will cut the work load and offers a magical solution. Anyone who knows anything about computers realises that that is not true. As the saying goes, if one puts rubbish in, one gets rubbish out. It is extremely time demanding for teachers to keep records and so on. Teachers often spend weekends working. They do not leave school at 4 p.m. on Friday saying that they have finished work until Monday. I know from family experience that teachers often spend time on Saturdays and Sundays trying to knock out reports, which are demanded under the Education Reform Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That Act has not been a magical solution. All the prophesies that were made about it have come true. The Secretary of State has had to make the alterations that the Opposition suggested. We pointed out its faults. The Government were determined to go ahead, but the reforms turned out to be a complete disaster, which led to the near collapse of some schools. The Education Reform Act is not rosy—it has not been a golden solution, and it continues to be a serious problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 16(b) of the schedule refers to education authorities
	<br><blockquote><p>"providing advice in relation to the national curriculum (as defined in section 2 of the Education Reform Act 1988 and the delegation of financial management pursuant to schemes made under section 33 of that Act."</p></blockquote>
I assure the Minister that that is one of the nightmares in education. I received a letter from a constituent yesterday about the financial problems of LMS. A school was desperately short of teachers and needed two or three more, but when it sorted out its budget it realised that it did not have enough money for even one more teacher to satisfy its urgent requirements. Head teachers must now decide whether to have the grass cut or the windows cleaned, never mind the problem of finding £18,000 for an additional, urgently-needed teacher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that money was available, but I want to emphasise that he is offering less—his figure is not even inflation-linked. Schools will need much more money to keep their heads above water. The Education Reform Act will be strung around the Government's neck as one of their biggest nightmares. It could have been successful. We wanted reforms and were not opposed to everything, but changes must be matched with adequate funds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.14 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fallon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a useful debate. With the slight exception of the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Mr. Eastham), there has been wide support for the programme. Every hon. Member has his own idea about the priorities in his area. It would always be nice to have more money to do more. Nevertheless, it is common ground that ESGs and parallel training grants are having a beneficial impact and that they provide a key margin of funds to help to ensure that the service responds to changing needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the hon. Member for Leeds, Central (Mr. Fatchett) for his kind words. I think that he was trying to warn me that I might not be here next year. I very much hope that, with the support of my hon. Friends, I shall be here next year. Indeed, his prophesies have not always been a deathwish. My immediate predecessor has, of course, gone on to higher things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the hon. Gentleman for his broad welcome for the combined scheme. He made one very technical comment—that the document should show the amount of Government expenditure and the grant—being provided. As he knows, it is provided at different rates for different items. That might produce a more confusing document, but I am prepared to reflect on his suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Leeds, Central described the expenditure as only a 2 per cent. increase, and portrayed it as a cut in real terms. I think that the hon. Member for Blackley also attacked the regulations for the same reason. The Government grant is being increased not by 2 per cent. but by 5 per cent.—from £209 million to £220 million. The total of supported expenditure is growing by only 2 per cent. More important, local authorities do not want that sum increased. Their associations have argued consistently, including during this year's consultation, that they want specific grant funding to be constrained because they do not want to be tied down with earmarked funds for particular areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fatchett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I detected a sleight of hand from the Minister. Although authorities may not be keen to have too much of their expenditure tied down, I do not think that any authority would tell the Minister that it wanted its supported expenditure to be financed at a rate below inflation. The Minister seems to suggest that the wish of authorities not to have too much expenditure earmarked is also reflected in a wish to have the supported grant cut in real terms. I suspect that the Minister would have difficulty in naming a local education authority that had asked him for the supported grant to be cut in real terms. Can he name one?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fallon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Local authorities are consulted annually through their associations. The two points are really one. If authorities do not want to be fettered with a particular grant, it follows that the total cannot rise on an arbitrary basis by a particular amount in any one year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise the disappointment of the hon. Member for Leeds, Central about the disappearance of the local priority. A balance has to be struck between national and local priorities, and I think that the hon. Member invited me to speak again to local authorities about the matter. I shall, of course, do so. A consultation specifically on the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
grants is held in March each year. We shall certainly listen to any fresh arguments that the authorities may wish to put on that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No final decision has been taken on appraisal, but one is imminent. We are still considering responses to the consultation document that was issued in September. The period of consultation finished in mid-October, and we have been considering the various responses. Given the many other pressures on schools, the former Secretary of State felt that the time might not be right to make appraisal compulsory for all LEAs and all teachers at the same time. Some of the consultation responses that the hon. Gentleman may have seen suggest that appraisal is important to effective staff development, and some of those consulted want us to go ahead and make it universal. We take those views seriously and are considering them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Leeds, Central was a little unfair in his remarks about teacher recruitment. We have increased spending from only £2 million last year to £10 million. That is a considerable boost, but it is not the only weapon at our disposal. We have a vast range of measures to improve teacher recruitment and especially to encourage more people to return to teaching. The advertising campaign to which the hon. Gentleman referred is continuing and 30,000 responses are being followed up. The money allocated to local authorities is only a small part of a much larger campaign which will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked me about the management of classrooms and again criticised the small sum of money—£1·8 million—that has been made available. The total for all the different aspects of discipline is approximately £8 million. It would always be nice to do more for a specific aspect, but that is not the only way in which we are trying to improve classroom management. It now plays a larger role in teacher training courses, which should benefit those entering the profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman specifically asked me about the Workers Educational Association. Hon. Members who were here last year will recall the anxiety about how the WEA would be affected. This year's programme includes £1 million to help local education authorities provide funding for the various districts of the WEA. Previously, all funding was allocated directly from the Department, but we decided that it would be more sensible if a proportion of it were channelled through LEAs to ensure that what the WEA provided could be properly co-ordinated with other local provision for adult education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is still early days, but the signs are that the new arrangements are working well. We received a positive response last year to the invitation to bid for funds for this year. The full amount available was allocated and we have already had a good response from LEAs bidding for funding for next year, the figure for which will be £.1·2 million. We shall continue to monitor the operation of the new funding arrangements as they develop.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fatchett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister supply the important information that flows from last year's debate and say how many local authorities have made a successful bid for money under that heading?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fallon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot say how many bids will be successful, but we shall hear that before Christmas. I cannot tell the hon. Gentleman how many authorities bid last year, but perhaps I may write to him about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0027">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomly) made a valuable and useful point on which we might all usefully reflect. He said that it is not enough to say that the respect of teachers must be earned; it must be seen to be earned it it is not to be fully appreciated. It is difficult for parents and the public to see the good work that is carried on in the classrooms. But I see it as I visit schools and I sense a real enthusiasm in schools for the new curriculum and the reforms as they begin to develop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend rightly said that the head teacher plays a vital role. It might be appropriate to mention the local management of schools and delegation. Training grants were specifically excluded from delegation to protect them and to ensure that the money was properly allocated around the schools. That does not mean that the individual funds cannot be devolved by an authority to a head teacher, even if they are not formally delegated and handed over as part of a total budget. The LEAs will involve head teachers in their allocation of funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should welcome my hon. Friend at Elizabeth house and no doubt we could arrange for him to be taken through some of the assessments. It was generally concluded after the pilot assessments, certainly for seven-year-olds, that too much was expected of teachers and pupils. those assessments had to be made more manageable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have used the experience of the pilots. I think that my right hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley (Mr. Baker) was as wise to prescribe pilots as my right hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South (Mr. MacGregor) was to learn the lessons from them. We have worked through the assessments and achieved a much simpler more manageable form of assessment for next year for all seven-year-olds. I should be delighted to welcome him to Elizabeth house to take him through that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Blackley said—perhaps using the experience that he gained on the Standing Committee that considered the Education Reform Bill—that the reforms were fundamental and must be manageable. Since that Bill was enacted in 1988, we have begun to make the reforms more manageable. When professionals have pointed out problems and convinced us of them, we have introduced more flexibility in the way and the pace at which the reforms are introduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eastham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find it refreshing that the Minister said that the Government are taking notice of the consultation and advice that they received. However, I am perplexed about why they did not take that advice when they drafted the Bill. Opposition Members were inundated with advice of not a political but professional nature from people working in education who said that it was impossible to manage all the recommendations that were being shovelled into the Education Reform Act. Why has it taken Education Ministers and their Department so long to recognise what they were told quite freely two years ago?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fallon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They were the most fundamental education reforms for 50 years, and they have been on the statute book for only two years. At some point, introducing the reforms were told that almost all of them were unmanageable or unacceptable. It is interesting that teachers are now becoming enthusiastic about the national curriculum, given that some of the advice two years ago was against it. We must therefore listen when we can, learn
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
from the professionals and ensure that all the reforms are implemented in a way that makes sense to those on the ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Blackley cast doubt on the merger between the two schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eastham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Suspicion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fallon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He cast suspicion on it. However, there is a simple advantage in the merger. Although the two schemes are not legally merged, we can consider bids together, weigh them in the round and make our allocations accordingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned the extra responsibilities that will be given to governors, which I had hoped he would have welcomed. I think we had shadow governors before the 1988 Act who did not take real decisions for their schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eastham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's statement is a complete fallacy. Governors operated, often in a semi-independent way, in many schools and colleges. I have some experience of that in Manchester. Governorships in further education colleges were run in a business-like manner, and people from local industry were allocated seats on their governing bodies. The Minister is confusing everyone by saying that the structures did not exist before the Education Reform Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fallon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly had no intention of confusing anyone, and I hope that I have not confused the hon. Member for Blackley, who seems to be in a combative mood this morning. Of course the structures were in place before the Act, but the key point is that governors did not have budgets of their own to manage, and they were unable to take real decisions, based on their own priorities, about how to allocate their moneys.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman suggested that some governors found those responsibilities too much and were resigning or walking away from them. The National Foundation for Educational Research has just reported on the turnover of governors, and I shall ensure that the hon. Gentleman is sent a copy of its report. The wastage figure is remarkably small. Only a few governors have resigned, usually because they left an area. Most resignations are of governors from the old local authorities, who, if they are governors of more than two or three schools, surprisingly find themselves unable to meet some of their commitments. It certainly is not true that business governors are finding the responsibilities too great. They have come forward in great numbers and are playing an important role in assisting schools to manage their budgets and are offering financial and management advice on how the various priorities can be organised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eastham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister, through his civil servants, can furnish me with a list of resignations. However, he may find that the attendance record of those who stay on as governors is deplorable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fallon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If their attendance records are deplorable, they will be thrown off the governing bodies. In my home town of Darlington, local education authoritiy governors have had to resign because they have not been able to attend meetings.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
The hon. Member for Blackley next spoke more generally about teachers' pay. We certainly value teachers. It is important to restate that commitment, as was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot). We both heard my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister restate that commitment yesterday at a meeting that the hon. Member for Blackley was unable to attend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eastham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Show us the money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fallon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says, "Show us the money". I must tell him that teachers' salaries have increased by 30 per cent. in real terms—ahead of inflation—since 1979. In addition to the crude 30 per cent. increase, there are substantial incentive allowances. About 189,000 incentive allowances are now given, which amount to between £4,000 and £5,000. Authorities also have the flexibility to add local payments to ordinary salaries and incentive allowances. The hon. Gentleman should know that in four weeks time, we will be introducing a new system of payments for heads and deputy heads, which I hope will include the hon. Gentleman's daughter. Of course we would like to do more, but if it is as bad as the hon. Gentleman said why is teaching recruitment this autumn the highest since 1977? That is a substantial increase in the number of people wishing to become teachers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fatchett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the picture is as rosy as the Minister suggests, why was the new Prime Minister reported 	<i>in The Independent</i> on 24 November as supporting a review of teachers' pay? I suspect that it was part of his internal election campaign. Does that not suggest that he felt that there were problems with teachers' pay? If it does not, would the Minister support such a pay review?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Fallon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, we are reviewing teachers' pay. We have been reviewing it through the Interim Advisory Committee every year. The hon. Member for Blackley asked us to go through the Lobby and vote for that. We did so last week, when we gave a Second reading to the School Teachers' Pay and Conditions Bill. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will join us in the Standing Committee tomorrow when we begin detailed consideration of that Bill, which restores negotiating rights to teachers and allows local authorities even more flexibility if they wish to develop their own pay arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fatchett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to delay the Committee, but the Minister seems to avoid the point about a formal review of teachers' pay. Is he suggesting that the Prime Minister's commitment was simply to continuing the IAC, which we know from this morning's news has been asked to introduce a pay increase below the rate of inflation for the fourth consecutive year? Or was the Prime Minister's commitment greater to a pay review of teachers' salaries? If it was the latter, which was the clear suggestion of the report, are we right to conclude that the Minister would not support it? Is he saying that all is well now, without a review of teacher's pay?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr: Fallon </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am telling the Committee no only that all is well now, but that all is much better than it was when we came into office in 1979. Average salaries for teachers have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
been substantially increased. They will continue to be reviewed every year. We shall review them again through the new machinery—I hope that the hon. Gentleman will help to establish it—to ensure that teachers' representatives are fully involved and consulted. I hope that we shall see that machinery beginning to work, yielding a further increase next year.

Finally, the hon. Member for Blackley criticised the application of local management in schools. I do not know off hand the figures for his area, but I hope that he will ensure that his own authority if fully delegating as much money as it should to schools and is not at the top of the league of authorities holding back too much from their schools. There are wide variations between authorities, even between authorities of equivalent types. For example, the cities of Leeds and Newcastle are both metropolitan authorities, are both great northern cities and are both run by the Labour party, yet the amount of money held back per average school in Leeds is about £100,000 but in Newcastle is about £199,000. We find such differences unacceptable. We shall propose later this month further measures to ensure that more money is delegated to schools.

The hon. Member for Blackley told us of the difficulty of a head teacher who was trying to decide whether to have the grass cut or to have the windows cleaned. That is precisely the sort of thing that a head teacher should be free to decide, without referring to committees or educational administrators or through the council bureaucracy in the town hall. The head teacher should be free, with the governors, to make decisions about his budget such as whether to spend more on books, more on a computer and less on grass cutting, whether to have the windows cleaned in a particular way and even whether to issue a contract for maintenance and window cleaning rather being locked into ther sevices provided by the direct labour organisation. I must not stray too widely about the local management of schools, much as I am tempted.

I hope that I have responded to the main questions. I believe that the ESG activities proposed by my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State as part of the combined grants programme for 1991–92 will provide valuable assistance to local education authorities. I hope in particular that they will help schools that are already working hard to make a success of the reforms to carry on with their good work. The regulations will allow us to build on previous success and to establish new and better arrangements for a co-ordinated grants programme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
