	<p>(5) Where the Secretary of State makes a direction under subsection (2) above he shall publish notice of the designation in the Edinburgh Gazette and in at least one newspaper circulating in an area which includes the Area.</p>
	<p>(6) Where it appears to SNH, after consulation with such persons as it thinks fit, that it is no longer appropriate that an area which has been designated as a Natural Heritage Area or any part of it should continue to be so designated it may recommend to the Secretary of State that the designation be cancelled or, as the case may be, varied.</p>
	<p>(7) Where the Secretary of State receives a recommendation under subsection (6) above he may, by a direction under this subsection, cancel or, as the case may be, vary the designation of the Natural Heritage Area; and subsections (3) to (5) above shall apply to a direction proposed to be made under this subsection as they apply to a direction proposed to be made under this subsection as they apply to a direction proposed to be made under subsection (2) above, and for the purposes of such application the reference in subsection (3) to the proposed area shall be construed as a reference to the Area.</p>

	<ol>
	<li>the sustainable economic and social development of communities in the park areas;</li>
	<li>the conservation and enhancement of the natural heritage of the park and its cultural, historic and archaeological heritage;</li>
	<li>the quiet enjoyment of the park area by the public; and the furtherance of public understanding of the parks purposes; and to make such recommendations with respect thereto to the Secretary of State and to local authorities or public bodies as may appear to SNH to be necessary or expedient, and</li></ol>

	<p>Government amendment No. 73.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In introducing new clause 15, I should point out that hon. Members will now have had the opportunity to read our consultation paper on natural heritage areas, which was sent to all members of the Committe last week.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0131">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>225</span>
In view of the information now available to the Committee, I do not intend to speak at great length in introducing new clause 15, but I am sure that hon. Members will find it helpful if I mention some of the most relevant points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I want to make it clear that our proposals for natural heritage areas are not a substitute for national parks. As we stated in the consultation paper, they have a different origin, would have a different function and would be applicable throughout Scotland. There have been many representations, including those from the Nature Conservancy Council and the Countryside Commission for Scotland, pointing out that sites of special scientific interest are not necessarily an appropriate mechanism for habitat conservation over large areas of Scotland. However, SSSIs are at present the only statutory means of protecting such habitats. That emerged clearly from the assessment carried out by the NCC of the flow country of Caithness and Sutherland. Although it is generally recognised that there is a large area of national and sometimes international nature conservation interest, it is also recognised that the level of protection afforded by SSSIs is not necessary for the whole area, given the variability of the scientific interest over it. We therefore believe that a less rigid means of protection of habitats would be appropriate, within which areas of higher scientific significance could be afforded the stronger protection under section 28 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By contrast—I am sure that this will be evident from the speech by the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall)—national parks have been devised as a means of encouraging recreational provision and managing recreational access in mountain areas. I appreciate that the CCS wishes to widen the concept of national parks to cover landscape conservation and, potentially, nature conservation. We are aware that the concept of environmentally sensitive areas, which has received widespread support, should be applied in a natural heritage context to appropriate parts of lowland, as well as upland, Scotland. There are, for example, areas of lowland Scotland where damage to the landscape has been considerble, and I am sure that hon. Members will recognise that that statement could apply also to parts of central Scotland. Priority must be given to the rejuvenation of those areas and the designation of a natural heritage area might be an appropriate way forward—for example, to reinforce work being undertaken by Central Scotland Woodlands Ltd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More specifically on new clause 15, hon. Members will see that our proposals are based on a consultative approach among all relevant interests. It is essential that those who use, own and manage land should help to develop the proposals and, after designation by the Secretary of State, put them into practice. We recognise that some will argue that that approach, which is based on the voluntary principle, is inadequate and that more stringent powers are required. We do not agree with that, largely because an integrated approach to the conservation and management of areas of natural heritage significance has not been carried out in the past. That is a reason
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>226</span>
why we propose the merger of the NCCS and the CCS. Furthermore, there will be available to Scottish Natural Heritage a wide range of statutory powers, which we believe will help to bring about a more co-operative approach. Some of these have been underused in the past and others, such as management agreements under section 49A of the Countryside (Scotland) Act 1967, have never been used. We wish to avoid over-elaborate procedures and new bureaucracy. That is why we intend SNH to have a key role in developing proposals and working in partnership with local communities, landowners, occupiers and other relevant interests concerned with conservation and the enjoyment of these areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether this is the right time to ask the Minister, but there seems to be a problem, which was raised by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, about the relationship between the Forestry Commission and the river purification boards. Will the Minister deal with that problem at his convenience?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly SNH will have a positive role in that matter. Millions of pounds have been spent on studies of acidification, which is a problem caused not only by power stations, but by trees. There are strict rules about where trees can be planted near rivers, because they can affect the fish. The hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) referred specifically to birds and I shall make inquiries and pass on the fullest information that I can on that subject, but I can say now that SNH will undoubtedly have a role in that connection under the powers provided by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our proposals will provide the framework within which the management of areas of natural heritage significance can be developed in an integrated way. The development of a management statement, to be approved by the Secretary of State at the time of designation, will provide the basis for implementing agreed aims and objectives for the long-term management of a natural heritage area. The Scottish Office will expect SNH to give priority to these areas in the use of its resources and statutory powers. In addition, we would expect SNH to be consulted on the policies of local authorities, Government Departments and agencies within designated areas, and when appropriate it would represent its views to the Secretary of State on any desirable changes of policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would prefer to wait to hear what Opposition Members say about the next two new clauses before I respond to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sam Galbraith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Strathkelvin and Bearsden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall accept the new clause, but with some reservations. It will provide a useful new designation of large sites, such as the flow country, to which the Minister referred. However, we are worried that it is an attempt to pre-empt national parks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter was referred to in the original document that was circulated for limited consultation. It is mentioned in the current document and I hope that when the Minister replies, he will reaffirm that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0132">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>227</span>
new clause in no way pre-empts national parks and will never be used as a reason for not proceeding with national parks, which is one of our fears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause has undoubtedly been prompted by the Nature Conservation Council. As we know, SNH will be a blend of the NCC and the Countryside Commission. As the NCC is the larger body, it will tend to dominate. There is a growing fear—it was expressed to me at the outset, but I dismissed it at the time—which I am now more willing to accept that SNH is in danger of becoming the NCC with another name, subverting the CCS, rather than merging with it. We are worried about the NCC's dismissive approach to national parks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause seems to deal solely with conservation issues, in that it would limit access. The original document stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Possible methods of achieving this aim will include buffer zones, checks on access for the public".</p></blockquote>
I do not understand why that phrase was ever included in the document. Such a proposal seems a little undiplomatic. I am delighted that it was omitted from the formal consultation document, although that still contains some worrying phrases and some of the original language, such as the need to take
	<br><blockquote><p>"account of the public desire for access and the varying capacity of the land to accommodate any uses. A generalised framework to guide the different intensities of activity and possible changes that might be accommodated should be developed. This would be designed to reflect as far as possible the carrying capacity of the land in relation to present and potential uses."</p></blockquote>
That remains worrying. Although the proposal does not use the original phraseology
	<br><blockquote><p>"checks on access for the public",</p></blockquote>
it still contains the semantics of restrictions on access.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to make it clear that, given the choice between access and nature conservation, I would favour nature conservation. For example, it would be correct and proper to have restrictions on access to Rhum. The restriction on access to natural heritage areas should be based on the preservation of flora and fauna. I hope that the Minister will give us an undertaking on that. The arguments about restricting access have been put aside; they will no longer be a major issue in natural heritage areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not pre-empting the debate on national parks, but it is clear from the document that the Minister is proposing to set up a land management forum for those areas. Apart from possibly designating four areas as parks, that is what the Countryside Commission proposed for the majority of upland areas. That is a large undertaking, and page 7 of the document states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The administration of NHAs would be based on existing structures and no new bureaucracy is envisaged."</p></blockquote>
It will not be possible to run large areas, such as the Cairngorms, without increasing the bureaucracy. How large will those natural heritage areas be? I accept that the working party will decide that, but we want to know whether those areas will cover the proposed national parks. Will they stretch from Braemar to Aviemore, down to Oban or even to Blair Atholl? Will they cover the plateaux—the Pools of Dee down to the Linn of Dee into Rothiemurchus and Glen Feshie? How can such areas be administered without there being extra bureaucracy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>228</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian Wilson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cunninghame, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend ask that in song?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can do that, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister say whether additional funds will be available for the natural heritage areas? Last week he gave us a firm undertaking about the funds that will be available to SNH in respect of its regional structure. It is not true that natural heritage areas can be administered on the cheap. Furthermore, land management agreements will cost money. The Committee will remember that £400,000 was paid to Viscount Thurso not to plant trees, when he was not about to plant them anyway. We must consider what that will mean to people such as Lord Dulverton, although he no longer owns Glen Feshie. It will require land management agreements and money to make the natural heritage areas work. Therefore, will additional resources be made available?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the time scale? The original document said that it would take a long time to set up natural heritage areas. I hope that the Minister will deal with our worries about the new clause. We accept the new clause, on the strict proviso that it will not pre-empt or act as a substitute for national parks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I simply want a rough estimate of the additional resources available as that would provide a basis for our discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumfries)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a difficult debate. Important new clauses have been tabled on national parks, and my hon. Friend the Minister has tabled this important new clause, which will set up natural heritage areas. If it is any encouragement to my hon. Friend, I should tell him that I left my vital file at home. As I shall have to make my speech off the cuff, it will be about half the length it might otherwise have been.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Minister knows, I have never been a great enthusiast for national parks, because of the additional bureaucracy that they impose on a country with well administered planning. During my years as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department of the Environment, I dealt with rural affairs and was responsible for national parks in England. It was a great pleasure to visit them all and see the plus and minus aspects of their administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Saturday 9 March, 	<i>The Daily Telegraph</i> reported on the considerable dissatisfaction with the Brecon Beacons park, which I visited last year. No fewer than 10,000 people—one third of the population of the Brecon Beacons—have signed a petition expressing no confidence in the parks planning department of the management of the national park in that beautiful part of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not expect universal praise for the national parks system. As my hon. Friend the Minister knows, administration is carried out by a national parks committee, consisting of a significant number of local authority representatives and Government appointees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0133">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>229</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro) may recollect the Brecon and Radnor by-election. Anyone who visited that area in a political capacity during the by-election knew what dissatisfaction there was with the national parks. We should discriminate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) for that first-hand information. He is well versed in the issues that we are discussing today. When I attended a Nature Conservancy Council meeting in that national park last year, I got the impression that all was not as well as I would have liked it to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like my hon. Friend the Minister to provide more detail about how the Scottish natural heritage areas will function in practice. That is the key issue. The planning authority has specific duties with regard to sites of special scientific interest under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. I apologise for leaving my hon. Friend's letter at home. It contained many details about the establishment of committees, advisers and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps my hon. Friend could take us through a case involving Mr. X, who wants to build a cottage in a natural heritage area. Will he explain the relationship between the procedures under the new clause and the planning authority? My principal objection to national parks as proposed by hon. Gentlemen is that they would require the establishment of another planning authority on top of the structure that exists. We need to weigh that in the balance in what is probably one of the most crucial debates on the Bill to discover how that proposal would work in practice. I hope that the Minister can rehearse a hypothetical case of a cottage being constructed of the right materials and design in a heritage area and explain the relationship between a heritage area and a planning authority. I do not want further complications to be added to a system that is already fraught with problems. Those who examine the planning system in Scotland view it with alarm. There are delays. The whole system is ripe for reappraisal and new planning legislation, and we must take that into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will my hon. Friend the Minister explain the exact position on access? I have read the document produced by the Countryside Commission entitled, "Access to the Scottish Countryside: Rights and Responsibilities" and a similar document entitled, "Access: A review by the Scottish Landowners Federation" which set out the complicated legal position in Scotland. I do not ask my hon. Friend to go into tremendous detail, but I should like him to confirm that nothing in the new clause would affect the current position of access in Scotland. If the new clause would make access easier we must debate that and if it would make it more difficult, we must examine that matter in detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people hold strong views about access in Scotland and if ever there was a time when we should proceed in harmony, this is it. We must take governing bodies and all those who are interested in the environment along with us and safeguard the perfectly fair right of the landowner to look after his
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>230</span>
property as he thinks best. We must bear in mind that the right to roam, which many people want, can have seriously detrimental consequences on farming, country sports and the enjoyment of others. It is awfully important to ensure that we do not make a mistake and give people the impression that they have a new right of access when, as far as I can see, there will be no change as a result of the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to hear the views of the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) on national parks and how they would fit into the scheme. I have a major reservation about the additional bureaucratic administration that would be imposed in parallel with or on top of the current planning arrangements, and I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will clarify that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also fear that the attraction of the name of "national park" will encourage additional visitors, which will have an even greater detrimental impact on such important areas as Loch Lomond, Ben Lomond and the Cairngorms. People are encouraged to visit the top of Cairngorm by chairlift and anyone who does so knows what a depressing sight it is because of overuse by the general public. The vegetation has almost disappeared, which is worrying. Stac Pollaidh may seem like a small hillock to the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith), but it is a small mountain to me. I climbed it a year or two ago and was concerned at the wear and tear caused by people climbing that most attractive hill. To encourage more and more people to go to such beautiful areas may eventually reduce the reason for going there. Damage is already being done to the honeypot areas by an ever-increasing flow of visitors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is how to get the balance right. That is why we need to debate the virtues of national parks, natural heritage areas or even the status quo. I am one of those on the Nature Conservancy Council who is worried at the size of many of the sites of special scientific interest designated in recent years, a prime one being the flow country. Many other large areas in the Pennines and in Scotland have been designated. We must bear in mind those large SSSIs when thinking of natural heritage areas. That is particularly so of the far north-west, which is especially beautiful and is a substantial SSSI in itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I asked earlier, I should like the Minister to go through a hypothetical case, telling us how the procedures set out in his document will work in practice and describing the role of the local planning authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to speak to my new clauses 8, 9 and 10. Nothing that the Minister said this morning has convinced me that I was not correct to table those new clauses on national parks. Last week, I wrote a letter to the national newspapers in Scotland, which one subeditor had a bob at with,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Ministers seem ready to sabotage the proposals for National Parks."</p></blockquote>
What the Minister said this morning lends credence to that heading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate should be about the document entitled "The Mountain Areas of Scotland", which was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0134">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>231</span>
commissioned by the Minister from the Countryside Commission for Scotland. The remit given by the Minister was
	<br><blockquote><p>"to study management arrangements for popular mountain areas such as the Cairngorms, taking into consideration arrangements along National Park lines in Scotland".</p></blockquote>
Where is that commitment? The consultative document seeks comments by 30 June 1991, notwithstanding the fact that the Countryside Commission for Scotland has already been asked to report on that and has issued a document for consultation. That is a ploy to undermine the case for national parks in Scotland. The Minister said that the case for national parks in Scotland has not been rebutted as a result of that document, so why is the Minister not addressing that issue, which has been a cause of anxiety in Scotland for 50 or 60 years?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister knows that in my area, national park status was recommended by the Ramsay committee in 1945. He also knows that national park status was argued for in 1965 by a sub-committee headed by Professor Robert Grieve. In his report, Professor Grieve said that Scotland should have national parks. History is being set aside today, and the Minister is ignoring the informed comments of various Scottish groups. I am especially concerned about my own area of Loch Lomond, but I take the general point made by the Countryside Commission for Scotland on national parks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister knows, Loch Lomond was designated as a regional park in 1988. The Loch Lomond park authority and the four constituent local authoriies—Strathclyde and Central regional councils and Dumbarton and Stirling district councils—have welcomed the principle of national park designation at present proposed by the CCS. There are reservations on specific points that I shall mention later, but there is no argument over the need for the designation of Loch Lomond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Loch Lomond suffers from the honeypot effect each and every summer simply because it is beside the major Scottish conurbations and attracts many visitors. Each and every summer cars are queued up one behind the other around Loch Lomond. The Government are not interested in the local community's views and comments or those of local authorities, all of which tell the Minister that national park status is necessary. There have been several public meetings in the area—all in favour of such status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no clear guidance from central Government on the development of planning and management policies. Local authorities have sought to redress that through the Loch Lomond local subject plan. The Minister knows that the Loch Lomond arrangements lack a firm legislative basis that is capable of coping with the inevitable tensions that arise when dealing with legitimate, but conflicting demands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regional park has been set up under a memorandum of agreement between the local authorities, under which they have an option of withdrawal at any time if pressed by their budgets.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>232</span>
Just a few weeks ago there was a possible financial problem that could have caused a major impediment. That was overcome, but the management arrangement is so ad hoc that it will not do for a place of such natural beauty as Loch Lomond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people are annoyed at the concept of national parks, but 120 countries have adopted it. In Scotland the concept seems to raise fears which should be addressed sympathetically. It is scandalous that we shall not have the opportunity this morning to test the Government's reaction by their tabling an amendment on national parks and accepting the CCS's report on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why Loch Lomond? On Second Reading I mentioned development pressures. The local authorities estimate that more than £120 million of development is at present proposed around Loch Lomond. There is no adequate mechanism to deal with that. There are also great visitor pressures, which will increase as personal mobility increases. If personal mobility were reduced—perhaps, by a rise in oil prices—the number of recreational trips to the more remote parts of Scotland would be reduced, but that would not effect Loch Lomond as it is on the edge of major conurbations. Reduced mobility might therefore increase the pressure on places near to hand, such as Loch Lomond. Whether affluence increases or decreases Loch Lomond will still suffer from problems created by visitors. We do not have adequate facilities in our area to cope with the number of visitors to the loch, 65 per cent of whom in 1989 were from Scotland, with a mere 9 per cent from abroad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not have the facilities to cope with such numbers of tourists and, when we consider budget limitations, we do not have the facilities for proper land management. We know, however, that local authorities entered into the agreement voluntarily. Despite the maximum assistance of 50 per cent that the right hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger), when he was Secretary of State for Scotland, provided under legislation, the detailed grant rules reduced that support to less than 30 per cent. That compares very unfavourably with national parks in England and Wales, which receive 75 per cent of costs, with fewer restrictions on how the moneys can be used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The CCS was established to examine the matter. It was clear and firm in its report "The Mountain Areas of Scotland" about what was required for Loch Lomond and other areas. It suggested indicative strategies for key land uses, the establishment of land management forums, the integration of grants for conservation and agriculture, protection for wilderness land, better management of access to open country and improved deer management. Those recommendations are being ignored in the Government's ploy for natural heritage areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Roger Carr, the chairman of the CCS, while welcoming the Government's consultative document on natural heritage areas, said that those were not a substitute for national parks. He is worried about the implications that an area of international importance, such as the Cairngorms, could be managed on an informal basis—on the voluntary principle. The suggestion that the Loch Lomond area could continue
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0135">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>233</span>
just as a regional park is also worrying and will dismay the local authorities that have been campaigning for national park status for the area for years. It dismays me, as well as the local community in Dumbarton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about the principles underlining the Government's policy of natural heritage areas? Voluntary action has not always proved successful in the past and the new proposals offer too little change from the weakness of the present system. The Minister should know from the representations made by the CCS and other interested parties, that the voluntary principle has been tried and has not been successful, even for Loch Lomond—it has a mechanism of its own—because all the objectives have not been met. Whichever way we look at natural heritage areas, they are nothing but a top down mechanism. They are not the same as national parks, which have democratically elected representatives. National parks, with designated funds, provide a focus on the natural environment and involve the people's enterprise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my new clauses I could have referred to the numbers of democratically elected representatives, given the Government's trend towards centralisation when we consider the river purification boards and other bodies. I did not include that in my new clauses, however, to allow the Government the opportunity to give their views on the membership. Alas, even that point has been ignored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not having a theoretical debate. National parks are about areas under pressure. The Government are giving me nothing for my constituents. I cannot tell them that Loch Lomond's problems are being recognised and that something will be done about them. The voluntary principle will do nothing for those of us who live in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The four local authorities involved are worried about the planning rights. I did not refer to that in my new clauses because the Government can consider those matters in their own time. Dumbarton and Stirling district councils are worried about the matter, but, in a spirit of conciliation, said that they would go along with it if the Government examined planning powers as they relate to national parks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a fund of good will from people in the area, but the Minister is ignoring Scottish and international opinion by ignoring the demand for national parks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the hon.

views. The Minister, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) laughs, but I hope that he will give us his comments on the matter. His constituents are involved in the issue of national parks, too, so it will not do for him to smirk in a corner and ignore the issue of planning powers.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the international bodies that are considering the matter, the Minister has resolutely ignored the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources and its advisers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a letter that the United Kingdom committee of the IUCN sent to the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Prime Minister. It is dismayed at the Government's rejection of the national and international pressure for national parks. Dr. O'Connor, its chairman, said that he hoped the Bill would provide
	<br><blockquote><p>"a valuable opportunity to resolve these anomalies and…demonstrate a firm commitment for effective management structures and adequate resources for particularly valuable areas."</p></blockquote>
He continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government has given a commitment to maintaining common standards for environmental protection throughout the UK and it is a matter of great concern to us that these common standards should clearly be put in place."</p></blockquote>
The common standards exist for England and Wales. The Minister knows that national parks have been a part of English and Welsh society for 40 years and have been a success. A letter from the director general of the Countryside Commission to the Countryside Commission for Scotland states that England and Wales have undertaken a review of their national parks and that there has been overwhelming support from the public in their affection for national parks and the value they place upon them. The Government's White Paper referred to national parks as being the jewel in the Countryside Commission's crown. The director general states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is also strong support for the further strengthening of national park purposes and a recognition of the need for additional resources; among the many hundreds of submissions considered, I do not think any seriously questioned the wisdom of having national parks. In short, once established, national parks in England and Wales have come to be accepted as a positive feature by all—whatever the arguments about the precise powers or functions."</p></blockquote>

The Under-Secretary the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), may laugh at that, but we do not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Our contacts with international organisations confirm a widely-held view that it is anomalous that there should be national parks in England and Wales but not in Scotland, even though that country has superior scenic and wildlife resources to that south of the border. I understand similar points have also been made by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources and the European Federation of Nature and National Parks (the Countryside Commission is a member of both bodies)."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The letter goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The type of national parks proposed by the CCS bear a close similarity to many European models especially with the emphasis on zoning and a close involvement of the local community in decision-making. This approach might therefore help secure funding and political support in the wider European context in future."</p></blockquote>
It is in our interest to go ahead with that because the finance needed to consolidate the status of the parks could come from Europe—that need has been ignored. The Government are sending a signal from the Committee to show that they are interested in tinkering with one or two aspects of the environment, but they are ignoring the major aspects on which the green vote is concentrated. They are not interested in Scottish opinion, the CCS or the view of its international partners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the Minister's attention to a letter from the Scottish Countryside Activities Council that was sent to him on 28 February 1991. It stated that at its annual meeting on 23 February it passed a motion expressing serious dismay at the Government's proposal to introduce a completely new designation of a natural heritage area without even the slightest amount of public consultation. The letter referred to
	<br><blockquote><p>"conditions of secrecy more appropriate to matters of national defence than to issues related to conservation and public enjoyment of the countryside."</p></blockquote>
It went on to express dismay at the Minister's stance and said that the council was
	<br><blockquote><p>"a body of moderate views trying to make a constructive contribution to planning and management in the Scottish countryside."</p></blockquote>
That council has co-operated with the Minister in the past but it cannot understand why the Minister has acted in secrecy and has not consulted local bodies. I echo its call to
	<br><blockquote><p>"discard this hasty and evidently clumsy attempt to incorporate a completely new designation into the Natural Heritage Bill…issue a new consultation document that gives us and a wider public an opportunity to consider the NHA proposal, looking to later implementation either by statute or by statutory order."</p></blockquote>
I return to the letter that I quoted at the beginning of my speech. I advise the Minister that I cannot be convinced that the new clause is other than a "sabotage" proposal to introduce natural heritage
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>236</span>
areas and to ignore the fine work that went on in the past in the Cairngorms and Loch Lomond. For the sake of appeasing powerful vested interests, the Minister is not giving true recognition to the Scottish countryside. I reiterate that voluntary designation will not do and what you are proposing this morning is completely inadequate—it has not worked in the past. Loch Lomond is under pressure; what are you going to do about it? That is the question that I ask you.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member must be careful with his use of the word "you".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I emphasise the point about the voluntary nature of the proposal? Councillor Duncan Mills, writing on behalf of the Loch Lomond park authority, stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"From what little is understood of the proposal, the concept would seem to be complementary to National Park proposals but, if based simply on a voluntary coming together of interested parties (or 'Forum') it would not be an adequate substitute. The reasons for this conclusion are alluded to in the following papers and examined more fully in the Commission's 'Consultation' report."</p></blockquote>
That is the view of the people in the loch Lomond authority who have studied the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I apologise to you, Mr. Martin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I advise my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) that I have had discussions on that issue with those people for a number of years. Councillor Mills does not express a partisan point of view but one held by a wide range of politicians and people in the community. The voluntary principle will not work and the Government are not providing sufficient money to allow anything to be done, about the problem. That is the message that I am sending the Minister. I should like him to deal with those points seriously and pertinently if I am not to report back to my constituents that the Government's new clause is nothing but a sabotage exercise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) spoke forcefully when making a strong case for national parks. However, I doubt whether the solution proposed for Loch Lomond could apply equally well everywhere else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is urgent need to find a mechanism which, on the one hand, would control effectively the pressure of visitors on sensitive areas and, on the other, provide for proper enjoyment of the countryside and the improvement of the social and economic conditions of those who live in or near such areas. The new clauses define new land designation areas. There is a danger that a lack of overall planning for land use will lead to natural heritage areas for national parks being treated in isolation from the rest of the country. It would be wrong to treat those areas in that way rather than as part of the overall scheme of national land use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also a danger of time freezing certain areas rather than developing them in line with community needs and national land use strategies. I fear that we shall fail to treat land and those communities who
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0137">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>237</span>
use it as one living, interacting entity. Any land use policy must actively include the democratic participation of local communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A blanket solution may be appropriate in some areas but completely inappropriate in others. The new clauses would add even more designations of landscape areas to a confusing plethora of such definitions, which include SSSIs, national nature reserves, national science areas, environmentally sensitive areas, regional parks and local nature reserves. Another tier in the designation of landscape areas for its own sake would merely add to the confusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether existing mechanisms of control are being properly used to overcome existing problems. Safeguards to protect the landscape or areas of scientific interest are already provided by existing planning legislation. New developments, with the exception of agricultural, fish-farming and forestry operations, are controlled to safeguard scenic areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note the hon. and learned Gentleman's hang-ups, but I want to get on with the subject of the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem of access, which was dealt with earlier, could arguably be met by the existing powers of local authorities, the Countryside Commission for Scotland, area tourist boards and private tourism and recreational companies, with help from the Scottish Development Agency, the Scottish tourist board, and the Highlands and Islands development board. All those organisations can facilitate access to specific areas. They can already provide visitor and interpretation centres, nature trails, footpaths and recreational activities. From that plethora of organisations and powers, what is needed is an agreed strategy for land use and economic development for the areas concerned, and sufficient private and public sector funds. The new clauses do not deal with those problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
National parks in England and Wales place too much emphasis on the protection of scenery and not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>238</span>
enough on maintaining the land. Any new designation must have a wide agenda which views land as an economically vibrant and sustainable resource, on which local communities depend for their livelihood. There are areas of the highlands and islands that are pressured—sensitive and fragile ecosystems, which must be looked after. The emphasis of national parks, however, is too narrowly defined and focused on conservation. The debate should go beyond preserving the scenic beauty of areas as if they were nothing more than scenic picture postcards. In addition to conservation and scenery, a wide agenda must include the culture, language and way of life of the people, economic development, tourism and patterns of such development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The need for initiatives could be met by land use management strategies and natural heritage areas. The wider land use agenda could be implemented more effectively through land use management strategies for specific areas co-ordinated by local planning authorities or through natural heritage areas, depending how they are defined and resourced. I await the Minister's announcement of the resources that will be allocated to natural heritage areas, and I look forward to hearing him define the relationship between existing planning organisations—the regions with strategic planning and the districts with detailed planning—and the new natural heritage agency. He has a duty to the Committee to define those relationships clearly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making an important point. I interrupt his speech to insert a question on that matter. A letter of 14 January to my noble Friend Lady David set out some of the resources available. Can the Minister give us an update on the letter to Lady David of 14 January? What differences are there in resourcing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has put his point well. I hope that the Minister has noted it and that he will enlighten us when he replies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way to achieve nature conservation and other equally important objectives is to encourage management working groups through land use management strategies for specific areas, co-ordinated with local planning authorities. Those authorities would introduce an element of democratic accountability and would be responsive to the needs of the local communities that they were elected to represent. They, rather than an additional tier of bureaucracy, should have the leading role. The concept of national parks looks like an attempt to impose a solution on local communities from above, rather than a response to grassroots needs from below.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that national parks were a mechanism for imposing obligations on local bodies. In my area there has been wide agreement among all political parties, including two members of his party who are on the board of Loch Lomond regional park, and local communities. In my area the plea for national parks has not been imposed from above. It comes from below, therefore is democractic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I should be happier with such a plan if it came from below.

The hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) mentioned the problems associated with natural heritage areas. There is a lack of definition and of obvious resourcing, and there are problems about the relationships with existing local planning organisations. Definition, direction and resourcing are the problems. I hope that the Minister will clearly define each of those areas, and reply to the issues that have been raised.

We have received confusing messages about the honeypot effect. We have been told that national parks attract an enormous number of people. The number of visitors to the Lake district national park has not been controlled. There has been an enormous increase in the numbers of cars on the road, hotels and extensions to existing hotels. I understand that the number of vessels on Lake Windermere is out of control to the tune of 6,000. Tracks on Lake district hills have been damaged by thousands of tramping feet. Others believe that easy access, not designation as a national park, attracts visitors. I have been told that the M6 is responsible for the large number of people visiting the area.

Scotland is not prepared for the ever-growing volume of tourists. That fact was brought out by an article in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> several days ago, which stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Scotland is not prepared for the pressures of tourism and recreation it will have to face in the next five years".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Earlier, I told the Minister that we in the Loch Lomond area are not prepared for them. I told him that regional park status is insufficient and that the voluntary principle has not worked.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point. I hope to deal later with Loch Lomond.

John Toothill, who is a national parks officer in the Lake district, forecast that Scotland would have to cope with three potentially disastrous threats: the decline of agriculture, the decline of local communities and increased visitor demands. We are not clear about what attracts visitors. I believe that what attracts both tourists and residents is the untamed state of Scotland's mountain areas and the spectacular vision that they provide. Surely, that special attraction can stand alone without additions being made simply for the comfort of man.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People who want to visit those areas are challenged to use their ingenuity and skill to overcome whatever difficulties they meet. No one has yet suggested that we should put a chairlift to the top of the Cullins or Mount Everest simply because someone somewhere says that everyone has the right to see the view from those vantage points. Those who want to get to the top will have to climb. I am sure that the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) will agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been suggested that a chairlift should be installed up Tower ridge on Ben Nevis. That sort of suggestion would certainly be stopped in a national park.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One would certainly expect a national park to stop that, not to put one there.

Those who want to cross a mountain burn in full flood will jump over it or walk around it, no matter how long it takes. Bridges are not built everywhere, although I know that the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden was pleased to find a bridge to help him on his way back from climbing a mountain. I hate the thought of seeing bridges everywhere and signposts, improved paths, visitor centres, car parks and shelters, food stalls and interpretation centres, especially as the interpretation should be done by those who live in the area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I accept that Loch Lomond is a special case. I am not convinced that designating the area a national park would do what is required. The area certainly suffers enormous visitor pressure. The west Highland way is now a shambles and a quagmire, and some may say that that would not have happened if the area had been a national park. I understand that the regional park status has brought little financial support, which is one reason why the area cannot cope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir Nicholas Fairbairn), talking about the east side of Loch Lomond, said that land that was privately owned was managed better than land owned by an institution. Much of the land that I know on the east side of Scotland is tenanted farming land. It, too, is coming under enormous pressure. Will the national park put car parks on that lovely east side of Loch Lomond? Will it provide all those other facilities? Will not the area then lose its natural beauty, because buildings and so on will be erected everywhere? I was told last night of someone who looked at a map and said, "We shall put a car park there", pointing to the east side of Loch Lomond, but it turned out to be a field full of sheep. I am trying to get the Committee to understand that we are not clear about what we want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I help the hon. Lady? She says that she is not clear about the way forward, but she must recognise the present problem. She talks about car parks. If, like me last year, she went up the east side of Loch Lomond in heavy traffic, with traffic jams and chaos, she would ask for more order. I have proposed a motion for more conservation and more order for Loch Lomond. Will the hon. Lady vote for new clauses, so sending a message to the Government that they have ignored the massive local support for orderly change? The Government are falling down on their environmental commitment. A vote for my new clauses would remind them of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes the point well. If he will bear with me for a moment, I shall tell him what my solution might be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole of the highlands is by its nature a natural heritage area, and we must find ways of caring for the whole area, not just bits of it. That includes visitor access without causing damage. It also should include the quality of life of those living and working
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>242</span>
there. There have already been long years of exploitation. The most important point, as I said before, is the cultural heritage, which is tied so closely to the natural heritage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities should be allowed to manage those areas, but they must be suitably financed and resourced. All our talk is so much hot air if we do not make adequate resources available. The most important part of our discussion today was the question asked of the Minister, which I ask again now: why do we need extra bureaucracy? Why will the Government not give the resources to the elected representatives, local people, under whatever guidelines are chosen to decide how a place should be managed? That is the way forward. That is of crucial importance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the debate goes on I cannot help feeling as I did when we last discussed these matters a couple of weeks ago, that there is an air of unreality about much of what is said. There is an extraordinary division between the most beautiful parts of Scotland as people imagine them and the reality of what evolves year by year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea of local democracy as a perfect art form, with decisions being made by the people rather than imposed by remote bureaucrats, and with the bens, glens and the whole of the highlands and islands being a natural heritage area, is one of an ideal sort of society. Those who travel regularly on the main tourist arteries through the most beautiful parts of Scotland find that difficult to recognise, and the problem gets worse as the years go by. Although the pressures on those areas are increasing, the ability of local planning authorities does not increase accordingly. Local planners are swamped with planning controls. The problem is compounded by the occasional conflict between local development motivations and areas that are regarded as important nationally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are trying to solve a problem that is increasing in scale, and will pose a serious threat if a decent management system that will operate in a non-doctrinaire way is not set up. If it is not, the protection and enhancement of areas to which we pay lip service will be subject to increasing pressures, and the aspects which draw so many people to such areas in Scotland will be undermined.

I do not wish to speak at length, not least because I am anxious to hear the answer to the question of the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro). I can hardly wait for the Minister to explain how the proposal will work and to hear him take us through a hypothetical case study. I take exception to the suggestion that those of us who support the new clause tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) are in favour of blanket solutions. That is rubbish. I do not know of anyone who has advocated blanket solutions. Anyone who refers to blanket solutions is introducing a concept just to knock it down: no one is talking about them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman cannot simply walk into the Room and try to intervene. Well, he can, but—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can think of some marvellous blanket solutions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Give the hon. and learned Gentleman a red nose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only blanket solution being imposed on us is that being imposed by the Minister. He is saying that there will be no national parks in Scotland. He argues that even Loch Lomond cannot be made into a national park because the appropriate legislative framework will not exist. Everyone, with the exception of the Minister of State, supports such a designation. We do not advocate blanket solutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A couple of weeks ago, my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) went out of his way to say that we must avoid blanket solutions. He rubbished the idea that Wester Ross could be a national park, and said that management regimes peculiar and distinctive to each area must be established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A possible solution to the problem would be to designate an area a national park, with the resources that go hand in hand with a national park. No member of the Committee should take exception to new clause 8. It would not establish national parks. It would allow SNH to decide whether an area was appropriate for designation as a national park. The approval of the Secretary of State would be needed before a national park could be designated. Nothing in the new clause would force national parks down anyone's throat. It recognises that, among the plethora of solutions, national parks might be a remedy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the possible solutions—the initials, the formulae and the acronyms—why does the Minister resist national parks? The answer to that is given in paragraph 4 on page 6 of the document entitled "Natural Heritage Areas", under the heading "Resources". We recognise that some Government resources are required for national parks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second reading, when my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) argued the case for Loch Lomond to be designated a national park, he recognised that the local authorities unanimously did much of the lobbying. He also recognised that part of the attraction of national park designation is the greater availability of resources. There is no secret or guilt about it such that we dare not speak its name. Local authorities and others involved want national park status for Loch Lomondside because they see it as a means of obtaining additional resources to cope with the increasing problems and difficulties that they face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
English national parks receive a couple of million pounds a year from Government towards their management—a considerable sum that enables the job to be done better. By contrast, in paragraph 4 of the document on natural heritage areas, which deals with resources, the Government state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the first instance, resources will be devoted to the development of proposals for designation and the preparation of a Management Statement".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>244</span>
That will not cost much.
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is therefore too early to determine the level of resources required to run an unknown number of NHAs that might ultimately be designated by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
I congratulate whoever wrote that on his sheer vacuousness. It means nothing and says nothing, and it does not amount to a penny towards the management of such areas. The attraction for the Government in creating natural heritage agencies as a form of halfway house is that that absolves them from the need to make any financial commitment in the near future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall not oppose natural heritage areas, as we have nothing against them. There probably are parts of Scotland where they are the appropriate formula, which can be used on a voluntary basis. We are reasonable and flexible on that, but the Minister is not, as he says that under no circumstances will there be national parks in Scotland under the Bill. If he were to say that national parks could be created alongside natural areas, new clause 8 should be accepted, as it would not establish national parks, but allow them to exist alongside natural heritage areas. It says not that national parks will be created, but that they can be created if SNH wants them, if the Secretary of State approves, and if there is local support. It is a modest form of enabling proposals which the Minister should accept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Undoubtedly, this is the most significant debate that we shall have. I shall deal with the queries about natural heritage areas, but I should like to say that the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) was unfair to the Minister of State who was merely going out of the Room to receive his box, which was filled with urgent messages. Furthermore, the Minister of State has seen me on many occasions to press the national heritage interests of his constituents. We shall set up a working group for the Loch Lomond area; it will pay special attention to the subjects raised in the debate. I shall say more on that in a few moments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Opposition's acceptance of new clause 15, which does not pre-empt national parks. Indeed, a recent press release from the Countryside Commission for Scotland said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The NHA proposals seem to be a realisation of the concept of land management forums we preposed in our report 'Scotland's Mountain Areas: Conservation and Management', and we welcome this."</p></blockquote>
I assure the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) that the timescale for the creation of natural heritage areas will be a priority of SNH. The exact timescale will depend on the degree of interest and the extent of disagreement about management aims and objectives. I cannot prejudge the time scale, as it is the solution, not the speed, which is critical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) asked about bureaucracy. That is to ignore the fact that SNH staff will advise and guide on such matters. They, and the relevant regional board members, will be in the best position to oversee and co-ordinate the work. I cannot accept the hon. Gentleman's argument that the proposal for natural heritage areas is an NCC amendment. I stress that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0141">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>245</span>
the Countryside Commission for Scotland accepts that natural scenic areas have not proved effective, as it accepts the need to improve the position. That matter is not taken up significantly in its report on mountain areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, sites of specific scientific interest have not proved effective for large areas. Therefore, it is not true that natural heritage areas are concerned only with conservation. That is a vital component, but so is encouraging access. The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden did not mention that the chairman of the Countryside Commission for Scotland welcomed natural heritage areas. It cannot be argued that the commission's role will be overwhelmed by that of the Nature Conservancy Council. I repeat that the merger will be one of equal partners, and will be treated as such.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) referred to resources. It is premature to decide on resource requirements for proposals that are still under consideration. We made it clear that, before natural heritage areas are designated, SNH would be expected to devote staff resources to developing individual proposals. After designation, it would be expected to give priority to natural heritage areas in the disposition of its resources and in the use of its statutory powers. Identification of resource requirements for natural heritage areas will be an essential part of the preparation of development proposals put to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will be aware of the considerable resources that have been already devoted to the four special areas indentified by the Countryside Commission for Scotland. We expect that level of funding to continue. It is important that resources are targeted effectively and that there is no duplication or counter bidding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the Minister cannot give too firm a commitment, but will he say whether there exists a Treasury agreement in principal for significant resources to be allocated to the project?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is generally a matter for the Secretary of State for Scotland to decide priorities within the framework of the available Scottish block grant. We made it clear that the bids made by SNH will be considered sympathetically. My conviction is that it will be given the necessary resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before designation, Scottish Natural Heritage will be expected to devote staff resources to developing individual proposals. After designation, it will be expected to give priority in the use of its resources and statutory powers. It will intitially devote staff resources to developing selection criteria and to preparing proposals for the early designation of priority areas. Identification of resource requirements will be an essential part of the preparatory stages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs Michie) and my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro) referred to those national parks that have controversial powers. My hon. Friend asked
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>246</span>
specifically how planning applications in sensitive areas would be handled. Planning authorities will retain their powers. Section 262(c) of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1972, which the new clause would amend, places a statutory duty in planning authorities to take account of the desirability of preserving and enhancing such areas' character and appearance when performing their planning functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend asked how the process will work in individual cases. A management statement prepared for a natural heritage area will include policies for dealing with development, and will provide the framework for SNH to make representations to relevant authorities. In the hypothetical case of the housing application that the hon. Gentleman mentioned, it would be for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to direct local planning authorities to a town and country planning notification of applications direction, to consult SNH on any application presented in the direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such developments are likely to be of a scale and type that would undermine the management aims and objectives of the area. If SNH objected, the application would be referred to the Secretary of State, to take a view on whether he should rule on the application. Those procedures are well tried and tested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a very bureaucratic explanation, and anyone who understood it must be a brighter planning enthusiast than I am. We are not dealing with a political issue—we are trying to get it right for Scotland. For many years, the Scottish Office has issued planning guidelines, with which local authorities agree or throw in the waste paper basket. Sadly, reporters frequently seem to do the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every planning application for a sensitive area should be judged on its merits, not as part of a great scheme, or under guidelines laid down by a planning authority or SNH. Unless individual views are sought on each application, no progress will be made. The additional planning constraints to which my hon. Friend the Minister referred will add a great deal of time to the decision-making process and make it extremely bureaucratic. If we go down the road of appealing through an inquiry to a reporter, will the reporter make the decision, as at present—which I think is wrong—or will it be made by the Secretary of State?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, the Secretary of State could take the decision, if he believed that there were grounds for doing so, when the papers were submitted to the Department. Environmental interests will be taken into account. We recently published a glossy magazine describing good environmental practices for countryside housing applications. One of the offending practices that it highlights is the use of ribbon development—which would be entirely unsuitable, as I am sure my hon. Friend understands. We believe that we achieved the right balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dumbarton said that we had proceeded in secret. That is not so. The Secretary of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0142">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>247</span>
State presented the Government's proposal for a new multiple-purpose designation more than a year ago. It was discussed in the consultation paper, "Scotland's Natural Heritage: The Way Ahead", and elicited a positive response from all who commented on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree strongly with the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) that existing mechanisms are not used adequately. I cannot accept the arguments for new mechanisms, when management agreements under section 49A of the Countryside (Scotland) Act 1967, and access agreements under section 13 of that Act, have not been used. There exist powerful tools that are central to the voluntary approach, but they have not been used. It is essential that those mechanisms should be thoroughly tested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek clarification. Will the board be separate, or will local authorities and other organisations make it a selected board, having other purposes? Will the Scottish Council for National Parks, which is a voluntary body, be represented by people such as Frank Howie, John Foster, or Brian Parnell? Would they automatically be included on such a board?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is referring to the working groups that would be set up in the context of natural heritage areas, we hope to make a statement about the Cairngorms shortly. I shall refer to loch Lomond in a moment. It goes without saying that such groups must be representative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The setting up of a management committee is discretionary—it "might" be set up and it "might" include various people. What will be the relationship between planning authorities and SNH on natural heritage areas? Local authorities have a statutory duty to consult SNH and take into accounts its views. However, they have no statutory right to be represented on SNH. Members of SNH will not be elected—they will be appointed—but local authorities are democratic. They have been given statutory duties regarding SNH but no statutory rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's point is probably more relevant to the concept of national parks. Clearly, there is a dispute about the administration of designated areas and whether that should fall within the remit of a new park authority or within that of a joint committee set up with local authorities. If the national park option was pursued, that dilemma would have to be resolved. The working group for the Cairngorms will, however, be established soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Natural heritage areas must be sensitive to local needs and to the role of local owners and occupiers. They will be based on the voluntary principle. The designation of a natural heritage area will provide opportunities to manage recreational and other pressures more effectively. When SNH draws up designation proposals, we expect it to establish a working party comprising all relevant interests, including local communities, local authorities, owners and occupiers of land and conservation and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>248</span>
recreational interests. The Secretary of State will advertise the proposals in relevant local newspapers and anyone interested will have six weeks in which to make representations. In the light of the proposals made by SNH and the representations received, it will then be for the Secretary of State to decide on the matter. I have mentioned already the areas that could be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Planning authorities would have a statutory duty to take account of an area's status when exercising their functions under planning legislation. We expect modifications to plans to conform to the aims and objectives of the management of an area, approved by the Secretary of State. However, before that stage, local communities would have the opportunity to make representations and I have no doubt that they will do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries asked about access. As he suggested, we are fully committed to respecting the traditional freedom to roam in Scotland. The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden also referred to access. We look forward to the recommendations that will be contained in the important review of access that the CCS is expected to publish in 1992. SNH will have the power to negotiate access agreements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden asked whether our position on natural heritage areas pre-empts the discussion on national parks—it does not. Natural heritage areas have a different starting point and a different purpose. We have not ruled out national parks in Scotland as a future model, but such a major proposal cannot be rushed into legislation when the responses to the CCS consultation exercise have only just become available, and when there is no clear consensus in favour of national parks designation. We agree with the CSS, however, that national parks are a means of overcoming some of the problems of designating extensive areas of land as SSSIs. That is the value of natural heritage areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely what the Minister has said suggests that the timing and synchronisation of the Bill is absurd. We are discussing a Bill that will introduce a new Scottish environmental agency. The main question is how areas of great scenic importance will be managed, but the Minister responds by saying that he cannot answer that question now because the CCS report has not be available long enough. Why are we dealing with the Bill now, when the Minister tells us that he cannot give us considered and comprehensive proposals on the fundamental issue embodied in it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clinching argument is that all the protective mechanisms have not been used effectively in the past.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way in a moment. Members of the Committee will recall from our first debate on national parks that the Government welcomed the CCS's report, "The Mountain Areas of Scotland". We agreed that there was a need for more integrated management of the mountain areas of Scotland with the aim of enhancing and conserving the quality of the environment, while ensuring that everyone, especially the local communities, would benefit from the sustainable use of the natural resources of those areas. In the limited time available since that report was published, we have had time to examine the responses only briefly. However, it is clear from the tabulation of those responses that opinion is split about the need for action in special areas and the designation of national parks—60 per cent of the respondents favoured special arrangements and 40 per cent saw no need for them. Similarly, the responses to the CCS proposals for national parks in four areas are not clear cut. We noted that those from Wester Ross showed great interest in the conservation and management of their national heritage, but were unanimous that national parks do not represent the most appropriate basis for progress. We believe that the interest shown in Wester Ross provides an excellent basis for the further planning of the area and shall invite the staff of the CCs and the NCCS to work jointly with local interests to identify how conservation and the use and management of the area can be achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We note, too, that there was little interest in the commission's proposals for a national park in the Glencoe, Ben Nevis and Black Mount area, although we recognise the pressures arising from visitor use in that area. We are looking to the CCS and the NCCS—SNH—to find ways in which to overcome the specific sites related problems of visitor pressure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In the Cairngorms, there was a considerable body of opinion which agreed on the need for special action, but not necessarily in the form proposed by the CCS. In view of the general consensus that action in that area was a priority and in accordance with the CCS's recommendation that action be undertaken in the Cairngorms as a matter of urgency, we have been organising the establishment of a working party to report on the management issues and we hope to announce the membership of that group shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the hon. Member for Dumbarton is worried about Loch Lomond. Representations in favour of a national park in that area have been made, but I understand that local residents have expressed anxiety about the effect that such designation would have on the number of visitors. Views are by no means unanimous, which supporters of national park proposals sometimes claim. We appreciate that there are pressures arising from the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>250</span>
attractiveness of the area and its proximity to major population centres, but I stress that existing mechanisms are available to deal with such pressures. The planning system to approve structure and local plans, for example, can deal with the development proposals around the loch shores.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local authority byelaws could be used to regulate conflicting uses on the loch itself. Working within the overall framework set out in the Loch Lomond special plan, I believe that the Loch Lomond park authority could develop, with SNH, the use of existing mechanisms, such as management and access agreements. However, I understand and appreciate the strength of the calls for special action in the Loch Lomond area and appreciate the arguments for considering a wider zone. I agree that there is a need for action, but while it is premature to fix firm boundaries, we are convinced that the Trossachs as far east as the line between Callender and Killin would be an appropriate areas for considering an integrated management approach. We believe that the best way forward is to set up a working group, with appropriate representation from local communities and other local interests, as well as the NCCS and the Loch Lomond park authority. I have had several meetings with my hon. Friend the Minister, the Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) on that subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We intend the working group to consider urgently means of improving the conservation of the natural heritage and the management of visitors and to determine how that might be achieved within the existing statutory and administrative framework. We shall ask the group to report back this year, in recognition of the need for urgent action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for recognising that Loch Lomond is a special case, but I am mystified that local residents have expressed concern about its becoming a national park. I should like to know their names and addresses. I have had only support for that proposal, which crosses a wide spectrum of political views, so I am perplexed by the Minister's remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister talked about planning being better used. I cannot stress enough that that response has come from local authorities. I referred to the difficulties that local district councils have with planning. In a letter to me of 13 February 1991, the director of planning of Dumbarton district council states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In a spirit of constructive compromise they have suggested that these same Development Control powers be delegated to the New Park Board with the Council retaining a call-in power to decide the occasional large or contentious application."</p></blockquote>
It is because of the frustrations that we are experiencing now that those conciliatory remarks have been made. Everyone is working together. The Minister referred to a working group, but we have had enough working groups in the past. The Minister is telling us that we do not have a case for national parks, notwithstanding the fact that the matter has been current for two years and comments have been invited from hon. Members. The case for natural heritage areas has been made by the Government

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>251</span>
just now. That proposal has been bulldozed through Committee and responses are being asked for by 30 June. How does the Minister's logic stand up?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a somewhat lengthy question, but I shall endeavour to answer it. Representations on the matter have been made and my hon. Friend the Minister, the Member for Stirling made them clear in the meetings that we have had.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Can you give us guidance on the relaying of information? Would it be outwith the rules of order for the hon. Member for Stirling to speak to the Committee, thereby communicating the information at first hand, rather than third hand?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order. It is entirely a matter for members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Stirling district council wishes to retain its planning powers. Depending on the type of national park proposed, that might not happen. I hope that the Committee will appreciate that while the four local authorities said that they were in favour of a national park in the Loch Lomond area, that was only on the proviso that additional resources would be provided by central Government and that there would be no loss of strategic planning or of the development control function to a park authority. Given those caveats, it is hardly surprising that the authorities said that they were in favour of a park designation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The community councils are equally divided about the proposals. Helensburgh and Callender community councils are in favour, but Buchanan and Kilmarnock are against. Farmers and landowners are worried about the impact of increased recreational use on farm and estate management. They have all expressed concern about the lack of consultation when the report was drawn up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While we recognise the recreational pressures in the area, there is strong pressure from residents and those who manage land that national park designation would exacerbate rather than resolve the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask about the letter of 5 March from Mr. Frank Bracewell of the planning department of Central regional council? The second paragraph says that it is important for this Committee
	<br><blockquote><p>"to appreciate that the Commission's proposals for the integrated management of areas of exceptional landscape quality have met with an almost unanimous degree of support in principal from the major voluntary organisations concerned with countryside conservation."</p></blockquote>
From what the Government have said, I gather that that is being challenged. That was my first question. I understand why the Minister did not want to give way earlier, however, while I am on my feet, I shall ask about Glencoe and Torridon in the north-west. What consultation has taken place with the National Trust as major landowners in the area?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asked about the letter from Mr. Frank
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>252</span>
Bracewell, who works for Central regional council. My point was that the district council and the authorities concerned do not wish to give up their planning powers. The proposal for national parks could involve substantial powers, and that could lead to a dilemma that might not be resolved. As the proposal would be favourable to Central regional council, I understand why it advanced the argument set out in the letter. With regard to representations, I can only repeat what I said earlier. We are aware of representations from farmers and landowners about the impact on farm and estate management of increased recreational usage. The hon. Member for Dumbarton raised the question of the IUCN.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked about consultation with the National Trust about Glencoe and Torridon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the hon. Gentleman ask about natural heritage areas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, he asked about consultation with the National Trust about Glencoe and Torridon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give the hon. Gentleman a specific answer later as I know that he likes extremely specific and exact answers to his questions. Indeed, all hon. Members are entitled to such answers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that the United Kingdom committee of the IUCN has written to the Secretary of State about the protection of the Cairngorms. We are grateful for the committee's views, which will be fed to the Cairngorms working party, and will help to inform its deliberations. I assure hon. Members that the working party will examine a range of options for the management of the area, which is in accord with the terms of reference that we published last November.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that there are arguments for reviewing the management of a much wider area, but I hope that there can be general agreement that consideration should, in the first instance, be focused on the mountain core and surrounding straths and glens. I have already made clear our views about the possible purchase of Mar Lodge estate. It is not yet on the market, however, and action would therefore be premature. As I said earlier, we are prepared to consider any proposal, including one from a consortium of voluntary conservation bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dumbarton did not deal fully with the issue of access. Under his new clause, would the proposed Loch Lomond national park authority control access, and, if so, how would that be achieved? It is no use criticising the Government for mentioning access, when it is not clear how the hon. Gentleman would deal with access pressures on, say, the eastern shores of Loch Lomond. The issue is one of numbers, not resources. It would be helpful to know the hon. Gentleman's intentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries asked about access. Access agreements under section 13 of the Countryside (Scotland) Act 1967 deal with access to a natural heritage area. However, I assure him that there is nothing in the concept of natural heritage
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0145">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>253</span>
areas that directly affects the general law on access in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is apparent from the responses to the CCS report that there is no clear consensus in favour of national parks in the different areas proposed by the CCS, or, more generally, for national park-type provisions for special areas. We do not believe that it would be appropriate to go ahead with the CCS proposals so soon after the consultation exercise and before all parties have had an opportunity to study and comment on the CCS report on consultation. It would be premature to approve a provision now for the establishment of national parks. However, I stress that we are not ruling out that organisational mechanism in the long-term. We shall be prepared to consider any recommendations made by SNH once it is established.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William McKelvey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kilmarnock and Loudoun)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the debate and to the Minister. Is not there a case for making Loch Lomond a national park on an experimental basis so that a study of what happens could be judged by everyone?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that there is such a case. All the powers to influence use and the management of land have not been employed to date, including management and access agreements, and all of them could be used by SNH. Moreover, no key role has been given to SNH. Our conclusion is that the national parks issue should not be proceeded with now, but it could be re-examined by SNH to see how the present designations are working and to consider the greater use of existing powers. It would then be able to reach an informed view as to any necessary future steps.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
National heritage areas are not a substitute for national parks. We have had a wide-ranging debate on the subject, but we must put the special areas in the wider context of the general mountain areas. The CCS has undertaken important work and I hope that the discussion on the conservation and management of the mountain areas will continue. We shall carefully study the CCS recommendations for mountain areas. We are aware of the wide consensus of opinion in support of some of its recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While the CCS and others will, no doubt, be disappointed that we are not prepared, at this stage, to agree to the recommendation to establish national parks, I hope that they will appreciate that such an important matter cannot be decided upon just two weeks after the CCS submitted its report on consultation. The issues require more time for consideration, but we are not neglecting the needs of those special areas. We propose that early action be taken in the four areas identified by the CCS. In addition, our proposal for natural heritage areas will provide the basis for a new and more targeted approach as we are convinced that they will be more appropriate to wide areas than SSSIs and better understood than scenic areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have convinced the Committee that the Government are committed to the management
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>254</span>
of special parts of our mountain areas and that the hon. Member for Dumbarton will not press his new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister, although I am somewhat disappointed by his reply. This is the second occasion on which the Committee has debated national parks, so I shall not delay it for long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The time has come to pull a few strands of the debate together. First, the Minister might say that the new clause does no pre-empt national parks but what he said certainly pre-empts them for the moment and for a considerable time, to come. Although the Minister did not say that he was not against national parks, he made a case against them. He reiterated that the Government were not satisfied that current mechanisms have been used fully. If that is not an argument against national parks, I do not know what is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro) said, this is not a political issue. We are trying to find the best means for running the uplands of Scotland. In that respect, there is a consensus that we must do something for them and for certain areas in particular—the so-called national parks. There is disagreement on the exact nature of the mechanisms for their management and the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) went on at length about not wanting blanket solutions. He said that continuously because he was not present at a previous debate when I said that there must be no such blanket solutions. He did not specify that national parks represented a blanket solution but said that we should use current mechanisms plus local authorities or, perhaps, SNH, as an overall mechanism of management. I do not agree with him, but that was the arrangement that he proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are getting mixed up over nomenclature and mechanisms, but I do not believe that there is disagreement about the need to do something for the uplands. Four areas require something special, but we are not clear about the exact arrangements. There should be no blanket solution—Loch Lomond is different from Wester Ross—but there is consensus that on the fact that it is disgraceful that we are discussing a Bill that offers no solution to the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The CCS report has been available for two years and there has been consultation on it. As my hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) said, if it is inappropriate to include an enabling clause to deal with the CCS recommendations, why is it appropriate to include one to deal with natural heritage areas—an issue which has not been the subject of consultation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister criticised my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) and said that his new clauses were not complete, but it could hardly be said that the Minister's new clause is complete. It is vague, non-specific and a purely enabling clause, so if we are to have such a clause for natural heritage areas, we should also have one for national parks.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0146">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>255</span>
The new clause tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton does not say that we are to have national parks but it would retain the mechanism for them, so the CSS report recommendations could be taken a stage further. SNH will play the lead role and, if necessary, it would propose national parks or management arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are keen to drop the words "national parks" but they form a good shorthand phrase for all to use. Let us study the matter and leave SNH to propose the mechanism for those parks. There is no difference between the new clauses tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton and that tabled by the Minister—they are enabling clauses. There is consensus about the fact that something needs to be done. Therefore both clauses should be put on the statute book so that the necessary plans can be introduced in the near future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Minister for the trouble he has taken to reply to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I dislike uncertainties and we seem to have left the decision about whether to choose national parks or some other designation at a future date open-ended. If we had made a decision, I would feel that we had rather over-egged it by having heritage areas and national parks on top of other designations. I am not sure whether we could administratively stand both.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will my hon. Friend the Minister confirm that if there was a national parks system, or whatever its designation, it would require primary legislation and hon. Members would have another chance to discuss it before its introduction in Scotland? I shall not go over the arguments about national parks because we want to make progress, but if he can give me an assurance that any form of national parks would require additional primary legislation I shall leave the matter at that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to my hon. Friend is yes. At present, we are unable to discover the answer for the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell). If he will elaborate on the particular point he raised I shall ensure that the information is supplied to him as quickly as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his offer. I wish to be constructive, so I shall explain the exact nature of the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make no complaint about what the Minister said because he did not speak in a sarcastic manner and was perfectly friendly when he stated that I liked specific answers to questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not just a matter of a member of the Committee wanting specific answers as there is a general feeling in the community that we need to know a great deal more about the matter. For example, Dr. Ratcliffe states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I personally believe in National Parks—not only because the concept has World-wide acceptance, but also because I have come to feel that anything so vehemently opposed by the Scottish feudal establishment must be good for conservation. The term is just a label, of course, and everything depends on the small print spelling out the detailed prescriptions: that is what needs to be addressed. The same goes for natural heritage areas."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>256</span>
That is the View of the former chief scientist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Simon Pepper of the World Wide Fund for Nature in his brief on natural heritage areas states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The term 'national park' conveys a high level status which may attract strong protective measures and international recognition, but may, at the same time, attract adverse effects."</p></blockquote>
That is the considered view of the World Wide Fund for Nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Brian Parnell, the acting secretary of the Scottish Council for National Parks, writes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We should be grateful for some information about the proposed new designation of Natural Heritage Area so we can properly appraise it. In the meantime we are hoping that the proposed addendum to the Bill that will enable Scottish Natural Heritage to designate Natural Heritage Areas can be extended to include National Parks."</p></blockquote>
Even Mr. Melrose, the legal adviser to the National Farmers' Union of Scotland, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Union shares the Government's concern for appropriate measures to be introduced to care for Scotland's natural heritage, and it is hoped that…comments will be of assistance in the development of policy in this respect. However, the Union feels that much detailed consideration has to be given to various aspects of the role and administration of the new agency."</p></blockquote>
Finally, Robert Smith of the association for the Protection of Rural Scotland, in a letter of 19 Feburary, expressed his organisation's concerns about the matter. That is the background against which I and other members of the Committee are asking for specific answers. There is real concern and we want to know a good deal more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his kind and courteous responses to us. Sadly, however, his argument is naked. His Back Benchers will probably urge him on to vote down my new clauses. It is important that we have put a pointer on the issue of national parks. I have tried to be conciliatory—the new clauses leave it open to SNH to examine the matter. Nevertheless, the Minister said nothing to give comfort. He set aside the comments of my community, the local authorities and others, and the voluntary bodies in Scotland. More worryingly, in the national context he disregarded the experience of national parks in England and Wales, and in the European context he disregarded the views of the IUCN which wants us to join the family of national parks. I conclude that the Government are not interested in the green vote in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The illogicality of the Government's case was ably demonstrated by my hon. Friends the Members for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) and for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith). The CCS has consulted for two years and has received favourable responses. There has been no consultation whatever on natural heritage areas. Even Conservative Back Benchers do not know what natural heritage areas will be when they are finally formulated. That designation will be highly inappropriate for the Loch Lomond area. Under the voluntary system, it has been discredited. Furthermore, it would not respect the objective of establishing a local, democratically accountable arrangement, such as the Loch Lomond park authority provides at present. It would not offer opportunities to combine the planning and land
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0147">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>257</span>
management functions, as a special planning board would. If it were established along the lines of an environmentally sensitive area, the confidentiality required of management plans, grant aid and management agreements would be unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, as many Opposition Members have pointed out, no mention is made of special funding arrangements required to reflect the national significance of areas such as Loch Lomond. As all those conditions are inapplicable and as the Government's logic is twisted and unacceptable, I cannot find a crumb of comfort in the Minister's statement. The concept of national parks has been valid for 60 years and remains valid after this morning's debate. We shall continue to press for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have consulted. Page 14 of "Scotland's Natural Heritage: The Way Ahead", which deals with environmentally sensitive areas, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government consider an extension of this concept based on the same principles of encouraging environmentally sensitive land use and management practices is worthy of consideration."</p></blockquote>
It might not have been spelt out in great detail, but it was in that document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My letter on natural heritage areas spelt out much of the information that the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) wanted. As I mentioned, management agreements would be drawn up carefully and would be subject to the Secretary of State's approval. There would be advertisements before that happens and local interests would be encouraged to make representations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be difficult, but the question of resources is evaded and paragraph 34 of "Scotland's Natural Heritage: The Way Ahead" is vague. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Under the Bill SNH will also have powers to provide grants and loans to projects and to establish development projects or schemes of an experimental and demonstration nature. We expect these mechanisms to be used."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already answered. Working groups will make an area's needs clear and SNH will make the necessary bids clear to the Scottish Office in order to maintain proper conservation policies in an area. As I have said, the Secretary of State has considerable discretion within the Scottish Office budget and the necessary resources will be given to safeguard Scotland's natural heritage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely, the Minister should reconsider the matter. His new clause will give SNH the power to recommend natural heritage areas, but the Labour new clause would lay down a positive duty on SNH to promote national parks. The problem of knowing the potential number of heritage areas arises because the Minister's new clause simply allows SNH to make recommendations, rather than provides a positive duty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: SNH will make recommendations and the work that will be carried out by the Countryside Commmission for Scotland

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tabled new clause 3 to bring to the Minister's attention a real and increasing problem that has not been resolved despite the several schemes that have been tried. On the island of Islay in my constituency there are about 32,000 geese; of those, 6,500 are white-fronted geese, the rest being barnacle geese. My new clause is not about the pink-footed or greylag goose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That number of geese is unacceptable on an island whose economy is based on crofting and farming. During the winter of 1987, the Nature Conservancy Council employed someone to do goose-dropping counts in an effort to ascertain precise numbers. That took some time to evaluate because not enough computer space was available, but it gave us an idea of the increase in the number of geese.

Next, a goose scaring scheme, funded by the Manpower Services Commission, was tried for one winter, but was not repeated. Another scaring scheme was devised by the NCC, and the Islay farmers were prepared to give the scheme a fair wind, despite their general reservations about scaring itself, but serious crop damage has continued.

Hon. Members may not know that geese graze at five per acre of grassland, while sheep graze at one and a half per acre. I recall that one farmer built a shed for his ewes to use in winter to allow better, more plentiful grazing for the ewes and lambs at turnout in March and April, but the thousands of geese wintering in that area stripped his fields bare. After landing on the grass, the geese ate it and pulled it out by the roots. When that happens, the farmer cannot make silage until the end of July—two months late. It is then of poor quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Islay branch of the National Farmers Union and the Scottish Crofters Union on Islay have repeatedly requested that those geese should be dealt with by amending the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. They are primarily winter grass eaters, competing with domestic grazing animals such as sheep and cattle. I discussed the matter on many occasions with Lord Sanderson, the then Minister of State, Scottish Office, who advised me at the time that that would not be possible and suggested that I wait until Scottish Natural Heritage was established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Well, here we are, and the number of geese continues to grow. In 1966, about 12,000 geese were counted on the island. By November 1988, their number had risen to 25,000, and now there are about 32,000. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds bought Gruinard dairy farm to be used as a sanctuary. That, of course, meant the end of the dairy farm, but that and other designated areas can cope with only 10,000 geese, so 22,000 geese must graze outside those areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Farmers outside SSSIs are permitted, and are paid man-hour costs, to scare those geese, but with little success. To be effective, that would be a full-time occupation. Geese are not stupid; they are even known to graze overnight when concentrated scaring takes place during daylight hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Islay's importance as a haven for wintering geese is due to the high standard of efficiency that is achieved by its farmers, with their good land management and quality grass. All that fanners are seeking is an equitable balance between their industry and conservation. It is unacceptable that one farmer should receive compensation while his neighbour does not, and such a problem should be remedied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Farming on Islay will decline to the point at which it will hardly be worth continuing in its present form. However, designating more SSSIs is not the solution. People want to farm in the way that they have always farmed. Continually paying compensation could, as one fanner said, turn the whole island into a goose farm. It is unreasonable to expect local farmers to be reconciled to unlimited encroachment by geese by unlimited possibilities of compensation.

Since 4 March this year, the RSPB has been conducting a letter campaign among its members
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>260</span>
in my constituency about my efforts, through the amendment, to find a solution to the goose problem. It is extraordinary that what I once believed was a responsible organisation should behave in that way. It uses emotive languages and refers to culling. However, nowhere in my amendment does the word "cull" appear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a life member of the RSPB, I assure the hon. Lady that I am appalled by its approach. It is most improper and I have written to the society to tell it so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman. I have received letters from many of the society's members objecting to what the RSPB is doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ample evidence shows that protected species can and sometimes do proliferate rampantly, and that control by culling is a necessary action to take in principle and in general. Let us consider other species, such as the increasing number of red deer. Furthermore, I believe that it was at the behest of the RSPB that the wild mountain goats on Ben Lomond were culled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a worry on Islay that other forms of birdlife are being affected. A lady informed me that there are now fewer swans than there were in her childhood. A crofter told me that geese endangered the resident bird population, for example, the lapwing or the peewit, that nests in depressions in the turf or fallow land. They nested on his land each year for 40 years, but there is now no sign of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The lapwing is a protected species and the geese destroy its eggs. It is extraordinary that the RSPB is on the side of an unprotected bird that is destroying a protected bird.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman for making that perspicacious point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have received about eight letters from people on the mainland about the proposal, two of whom support the new clause. I have received no letters from people in Islay, except from those who welcome what I am trying to do. The Islay folk know full well what the position is, and they know also that I represent their interests and those of the geese. I want to strike the right balance between wildlife conservation and the interests of local people who must try to earn a living on the island.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What evidence does the hon. Lady have that geese which, I understand, have different habitats from swans, are responsible for the decline in the number of swans? Surely it is more likely that land predators are the cause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I merely referred, for the interests of the Committee, to a letter that I had received from a constituent. Last night, a person on Islay told me that thousands and thousands of geese were on the shore at present. I cannot give the hon. Gentleman chapter and verse whether they are specifically responsible for the decline in the number of swans.

Some people would like Islay turned into a wildlife reserve with no people. However, I and the people of Islay are determined to resist that. Will the Minister face the facts? We have raised the matter with the Government time and time again. Will the Minister find a solution to the problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will take much longer than one o'clock to deal with the issue and we shall have to return to it on Thursday.

I am glad that the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs Michie) initiated the debate because the matter has worried me for many years, not only because of the geese on Islay that come from Greenland, but because of the barnacle geese on the Solway that come from Spitsbergen. If anything, the hon. Lady underestimated the number of geese. This week, I checked the figure with the Nature Conservancy Council and its latest evidence shows that there are 30,200 barnacle geese and 8,600 white-fronted geese. That incredible increase in the numbers is welcome because we want barnacle and white-fronted geese established safely in the United Kingdom, but, given the impact of geese on Islay, the problem is serious. As the hon. Lady rightly said, we are discussing barnacle and white-fronted geese, not the greys and the pinks that are so prevalent in other parts of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were flexible with the quarry lists under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, the problem could be resolved, at least to a certain extent. Back in the 1960s when Sir Arthur Duncan was chairman of the NCC, brent geese were having a difficult time and their numbers were reduced on the east and south coast of England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The brent geese were removed from the quarry list with the assurance that if their number increased dramatically, as it has now, they would be returned to it. However, that has not happened. There are always people who object strongly to changes and, by and large, they have received sufficient support
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>262</span>
to prevent the brent goose from being put on the quarry list. That has had an impact on the farmland in Suffolk, Essex and Kent and Sussex, where the farmers experience much the same problems as the farmers in Islay to whom the hon. Lady referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Such difficulties are experienced in Fife. As the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) is not a member of the Committee, I must mention, that such birds cause major agricultural problems in the Black Isle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I well remember the 1981 Act. Is it the former Minister's understanding—if I may call him that—that the new clause would be a contravention of the European Community directive on birds? We have international responsibilities, do we not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I was coming to that. One difficulty in adjusting the quarry list for the barnacle goose is that birds directive. However, surely the problem is not insuperable. I am sure that we could have taken up the matter with the European Community and perhaps receive a derogation because of the position in Islay where, over the past few years, the number of geese has increased dramatically. Not so long ago, the number of white-fronted geese had reduced to about 2,000 and great anxiety about that number was highlighted by objections to digging up the peat for use by the whisky industry. However, now the number has increased to 8,600—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
