	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mrs. Gillian Shephard)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Value Added Tax (Construction of Dwellings and Land) Order 1990.</p></blockquote>
The Order will restore the taxation of the long-term leasing and sales of new holiday accommodation. In principle, the provision of holiday accommodation has always been taxable. However, long leases and sales of new holiday dwellings by builders or developers were zero-rated until 1 April 1989, which left mainly short-term holiday accommodation taxable at the standard rate. In the Finance Act 1989, the Government abolished the zero-rating, following the findings of the European Court in 1988, which stated that zero-rating for housing was appropriate when in pursuance of a clearly defined social policy. I stress those latter words, as it can hardly be the case that VAT relief for the long-leasing or sale of holiday chalets and the like, which cannot be used as permanent housing throughout the year, formed, or forms part of a social policy. It was the Government's intention to tax all forms of holiday accommodation, including sales and long leases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government believed that the existing law, which referred broadly to the provision of holiday accommodation and defined it as accommodation advertised or held out as such, was sufficient for that purpose. A recent test case before a VAT tribunal, brought by Haven Leisure Ltd., has shown that that was not so and that the taxing provision should be interpreted more narrowly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Representations have been made to hon. Members by the British Holiday and Home Parks Association and some of its members. I was pleased to meet and to discuss thoroughly the issues with a deputation from the association last week. Subsequently, the association's solicitor met Customs officials. The representations made much of the fact that the order was totally unexpected and that there was no prior consultation. It should not have been totally unexpected, because Customs officials' correspondence had made it clear all along to the association that taxation was intended. I can give the Committee details of that correspondence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After the Haven Leisure decision Customs wrote to the association advising it that an appeal to the High Court was being considered and to await further developments. Obviously, it could not say that the law might be amended until the appeal to the High Court had been considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that the policy had been decided, announced and adhered to in 1989, the Government did not believe that further consultation was needed. The pol-
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
icy was decided in 1989. It was the legal means by which the policy had been put into effect that had been found wanting by the Haven Leisure decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the context of a broad-based tax such as VAT, which applies to many necessities of life, there cannot be an objection of principle to taxing those who can affort to purchase holiday accommodation where such accommodation can be clearly defined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have taken the opportunity to tax the provision of plots for the construction of holiday chalets and other holiday accommodation, and to tidy up some of the legal provisions. Amendments to both group 8 of schedule 5 and group 1 of schedule 6 to the Value Added Tax Act 1983 are required to achieve that. However, I should like to emphasise that the long leasing of the sale by developers of homes that can be occupied throughout the year as principal private residences will not be affected by any of those provisions and will continue to be zero-rated. Nor will the short-term provision of accommodation other than holiday accommodation be taxed as a result of the changes. For the convenience of the Committee, I shall now explain the order in more detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 1 merely confirms the title of the order and its effective date of 1 February 1991.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 2 has a revised legal note (7) to group 8 of schedule 5, to the 1983 Act, which extends the existing limitations on the zero-rating of new dwellings in two ways. First, it prevents a developer of holiday homes seeking to avoid the tax charge by leasing or selling, as a separate transaction, the building plot for a holiday home that cannot be occupied throughout the year as a principal private residence. The site for such a home is now excluded from zero-rating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, as well as a dwelling being excluded from zero-rating if residence throughout the year is precluded by the existence of a covenant, statutory planning consent or similar permission, a dwelling is also excluded if a covenant, statutory planning consent or similar permission prevents its use as the owner's principal private residence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. J. Beith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Berwick-upon-Tweed)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little concerned as to what happens if, for instance, such a planning limitation is thrown out on appeal, but the VAT has already been paid. Will the tax be returned in such circumstances? What happens if, shortly after the VAT has been paid, a planning limitation is removed, as can happen relatively easily?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shepard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The criterion is quite clear. The VAT must apply to a holiday dwelling, which cannot be a permanent residence throughout the year. Subject to advice flying to my aid, I should have thought that if such a condition was taken off such a residence, the VAT would have to be refunded. I hope that I am right, because it seems to make sense. However, I may have to come back on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<i>[Interruption.]</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A note will reveal the answer. I may have flown off on that commonsense basis, but I hope that I was correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 3(a) contains a new paragraph (d) for taxing holiday accommodation by excluding it from the general exemption afforded by item 1 of group 1 of schedule 6. It is now made quite clear that it covers not only
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0034">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
the short-term provision of such accommodation but a long-lease or outright sale of such accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 3(b) refers to the new legal note (10), which refers back to the limitations on zero-rating for restricted-occupancy dwellings, and brings such dwellings, and the building plots for such dwellings, within the definition of holiday accommodation. The result is that sales or long leases of new dwellings that cannot be occupied throughout the year or as a person's principal private residence, because of a covenant, statutory planning consent or similar permission, are taxable as holiday accommodation, as are the building plots for such dwellings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In article 3(c), a new legal note (10A) excludes from taxation the freehold sale or any premium paid for a leasehold sale of holiday accommodation that is not new. A building is defined as new in legal note (4) to group 1, as one that was completed less than three years before the date in which the interest in it was granted. The effect is to prevent the repeated taxation of holiday accommodation that comes back into the hands of the developer or holiday park owner for resale by him. However, any annual rental or other payment such as ground rent or payment for the upkeep of the holiday park and the provision of its facilities is taxable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further legal note (10B) defines holiday accommodation as including any accommodation in a building, hut—including a beach hut—caravan, houseboat or tent that is advertised or held out as holiday accommodation or as suitable for holiday or leisure use, but excludes hotel and similar accommodation. The effect of that note is, largely, to repeat the definition of holiday accommodation in the existing law, but it also makes it clear that it includes beach huts, and that it includes other accommodation, which, although it may not necessarily be held out or advertised for holiday use, is nevertheless held out for leisure use. That is necessary to prevent tax avoidance by the elimination of the word "holiday" from advertising brochures and its substitution by the word "leisure" or something similar. Hotel and similar accommodation is already taxed under paragraph (c) of item 1 of group 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In short, the order re-establishes the liability to VAT of freehold and leasehold sales of new accommodation when it is intended for holiday and leisure use only and is not suitable for use as permanent residential accommodation throughout the year because of planning restrictions on such use. I commend the Order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.41 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. John Marek 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wrexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not had the chance to congratulate the Minister on her appointment and I do so now. In the usual way of the House, the next word is "but". I must take her to task over the Order because what she said is liable to different interpretation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady skated quickly over justifying the order on the basis of the sixth VAT directive and I shall return to that matter later. She was unable to provide that justification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An obvious problem arises from the Order. I shall not spend too much time in discussing it because I
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
understand that my hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth (Mr. Buckley), who is busily writing at the moment, wishes to make a few comments on it. The order will create two classes of people. Those who are sufficiently wealthy will be able to buy a house or a cottage on a hillside in Wales or the Pennines but they will pay no value added tax because that house or cottage could be regarded as a principal dwelling. Those who are not so wealthy and cannot buy a second home may want to purchase a chalet or holiday home that can be used perhaps for six months in the year but, because of a covenant or planning restrictions, cannot be used for the whole year. If that is the case, they will have to pay VAT if the Order is passed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is unfair and the Government should not introduce legislation that will drive a wedge between two classes in society—those who are sufficiently wealthy to buy a home where they can live for the whole year and those who are unable to do so. The latter will have to pay VAT on their holiday home.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin M. Brandon-Bravo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: (Nottingham, South) I have some sympathy with the point made by the hon. Gentleman. Only recently have we been given any information on the matter. Does he have figures on the costs incurred by those who buy second homes on which no VAT is levied and on the prices paid by the other class of people to whom he referred, for houses in organised holiday villages, on which VAT would be payable? If there is no difference in capital cost, his argument falls down, but if there is, it stands and I should be sympathetic to his point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As in all such matters, no doubt there will be luxurious developments where the cost would not be very different. I have had a fair amount of correspondence on the subject, some of it anecdotal, but my distinct impression is that many developments offer accommodation that is cheaper than the purchase of a normal property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the hon. Gentleman's statement that he has some sympathy with my argument because, while it raises a political point, it is not necessarily a party political issue. The statutory instrument has been introduced quickly and not enough time has been allowed for its proper consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take issue with the Minister, who said that the intention in the Finance Bill of 1989 was to standard-rate those holiday homes. The intention was to remove them from zero-rating and a VAT tribunal decided that if they were removed, there was a choice to consider them as exempt or to standard-rate them. The Government thought that they should be standard-rated but the VAT tribunal held that they should be exempt. I understand that the Government have not taken that matter to appeal. Instead, they have chosen the not very good option of saying, "We have a majority of 100 in the House, so we shall produce a statutory instrument and will not bother to argue our case because it is not founded on solid ground. A statutory instrument will remedy the position in the way that we want." The Government have had recourse to that method, but I regret it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If VAT is imposed on purpose-built holiday homes, there will be even greater demand for cottages on the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0035">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
hillsides in Wales, the Pennines and Scotland. That point is made by the Wales Tourist Board and I have a copy of a letter sent to the Minister dated 17 January 1991 from its chief executive, Paul Lovelock, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I will not repeat all the arguments against proceeding with the Order which have been put to you save to say that the Wales Tourist Board strongly endorses them. I would, however, like to underline two points. First, is the aspect of competitiveness."</p></blockquote>
That is the matter on which I wish to dwell. If VAT is put on holiday homes, there will be more demand for cottages in Wales and other parts of the country. That creates a problem because a great amount of cheap housing in the Principality is necessary for local needs. There are problems in catering for local needs because of the demand for second homes. That is another argument against proceeding with the Order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have only one and a half hours in which to discuss the order and I could easily speak for a long time on the subject. However, I must try to complete my remarks as quickly as possible because I want to ask the Minister some questions, which I hope she can answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to harmonisation, what is the position in other member states of the European Community? I know that in Portugal and, I believe, in Spain, there is no question of VAT being imposed on holiday homes. If it is imposed, it will be only a very small amount. Can the Minister supply information about Portugal and Spain and, perhaps, other EC member states? Here, VAT is 15 per cent. and in other member states it is zero or very near to it. As usual, we are running down an industry in our country and penalising it unfairly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that to be the case, so the Minister should think more carefully about the order. It is not too late for her to withdraw it and she will find the Opposition accommodating if she decides to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another problem is that the industry is not in good shape at present. The official line of the Government is that any problems in our country are the result of economic success. However, there is another view, which is that our industry is in need of care and attention, especially in regard to the property market and the construction and building industry. Because of the state of the market, that industry is not in a healthy position. The addition of 15 per cent. VAT on that part of industry would cause it to reel over backwards and make it more difficult for it to survive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have received communications from various companies and they all predict doom, gloom and disaster. I do not take at face value everything that everybody says to me and repeat it from the Front Bench, but I have sympathy with the industry. If the order is to be introduced, now is not the time to do so, with the industry in its present state. I am surprised that the Government are pushing through such legislation. I suspect that they can do that because they have a large majority in the House and they do not have to worry about defending or justifying it. The problem exists, however, and this is not an auspicious time for the Order because of the state of the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point relates to a written question that I tabled on 17 January 1991 and that the Minister answered on 21 January. I asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"whether he has any plans to ensur there is no discrimination as far as value-added tax is concerned between those people buying a purpose-built holiday home and those purchasing from current housing stock a dwelling for use as a second home: and if he will make a statement."</p></blockquote>
The Minister replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is, and should be, a distinction drawn for VAT purposes between second homes which are capable of being occupied throughout the year—and which may be treated as principal private residences—and purpose-built holiday homes which the buyers cannot occupy lawfully throughout the year or as their principal private residences. There is no reason why the latter should not be taxed under a broad based consumption tax such as VAT when other forms of holiday accommodation are taxed."</p></blockquote>
It would be churlish of me to say that there is nothing in that argument. Of course, there is something in it, but the question is where the balance lies. I believe that it lies the other way. If holiday accommodation is taxed, there will be a socially divisive wedge between people who can buy a holiday home that can be used as a principal private dwelling and pay no VAT whatever, and those people—generally not so wealthy—who will buy a holiday home and, because of the order, must pay value added tax on it. That is a bigger social division than the one to which the Minister referred. I cannot agree with her that a distinction should be drawn between those two classes of homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's reply continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Failure to do so would conflict with European Community law." [	<i>Official Report,</i> 21 January 1991; Vol. 184, c. 13.]</p></blockquote>
That is where I take issue with the Minister. She mentioned that it was part of the sixth VAT directive, and I wish to dwell on that matter further. It could be said that the European Court of Justice rejected the Government's argument that all new buildings should be zero-rated, and it could be said that the decision required the United Kingdom to tax at the standard rate all new buildings that were not housing. In accordance with article 171 of the Treaty of Rome, it was up to the United Kingdom to implement the court's decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the decision of the European Court of Justice was much narrower. It upheld the European Commission's contention that the UK was in breach of its obligations under the sixth directive and the treaty, in that it applied the zero rate to the construction of industrial and commercial buildings and to community and civil engineering works. We all remember that famous judgment and we spent much time on it in our discussion of the Finance Bill in 1989.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The buildings that the proposed changes tax at the standard rate are clearly dwellings, not industrial or commercial buildings. The changes required by the European Court applied to commercial buildings. These are not commercial buildings—they are dwellings. It is my contention that the changes go beyond the requirements of article 171, in that they go beyond the decision of the court. I have a copy of a written answer on 6 February 1989 from the former Financial Secretary to the Treasury, the right hon. Member for St. Albans (Mr. Lilley). He stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am including several minor changes from the current provisions for construction and property in zero rate group 8 and exempt group 1 which do not flow directly from the European Court judgment. These have been inserted to rectify weaknesses in the law which have become apparent in recent years, often as a result of litigation. These changes are marked with an asterisk in the explanatory notes to the draft clauses."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 6 February 1989; Vol. 146, c.549.]</p></blockquote>

Clearly, there is no justification for this measure on the basis of the European Court judgment. There may be justification if the Government want more money, but that is a different argument. I beg the Minister not to try to justify introducing the Order because it is required by Europe, as that is not true. The Minister could argue that even if the decision in the infraction proceedings did not require the United Kingdom to implement the proposed changes, the European Community law requires the UK to standard-rate new dwellings when they can be used only as second homes. That would be a plausible argument. The Minister could say that it has nothing to do with the infraction proceedings, but they are second homes and should be standard-rated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It could be argued that article 4(3) of the sixth directive imposes compulsory standard rating on all new buildings. That provision overrides the exemption for the supply of buildings in article 13B(g). The only authority for the United Kingdom not fully to implement article 4(3) is contained in article 28(2). To satisfy that condition, an exclusion from standard rating must satisfy the last indent of article 17 of the second directive. That indent allows reduced rates or exemption with refund to be retained if in force on 31 December 1975, if the measure is taken for clearly defined social reasons and for the benefit of the final consumer. It is on that that the Minister will probably hinge her argument because that is the place where social reasons are defined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It could be said that dwellings that could not be occupied for a whole year cannot fulfil a housing need. Let us suppose that someone has two holiday homes. That may be an extreme example, but someone may occupy one holiday home for six months of the year and another for the other six months. He would have to pay VAT on the purchase of those two holiday homes, yet one of them, or perhaps both, should be regarded as a principal private dwelling. Anyone in those circumstances would clearly be disadvantaged. However, I shall not make too much of that as it is a rather extreme example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last indent of article 17 of the second directive provides for a reduced rate of VAT or exemption with refund. The existing exemption for long leases of restricted-occupation dwellings is neither a reduced rate nor an exemption with refund. Therefore, it is irrelevant whether those chalets fulfil a clearly defined social purpose. They do not specifically fall within any of the provisions when it is mandatory under the second and sixth directives to subject them to the standard rate of tax. The Minister's arguments on that matter are slightly wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second-home dwellings constitute housing and as such satisfy the social need test. The Advocate General gave his opinion on the infraction proceedings, which we had to put right in the Finance Act 1989. Paragraph 26 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If it was for the court to consider whether or not the decision to apply a zero-rate in respect of the construction of private housing was well founded, it could undoubtedly hold that measures of such a discriminate nature afflict the very wide view of the social reasons relied on. As I have already said, however, the exercise of such a supervisory role will impinge on the powers of the Member States. In any event, the approach adopted by the United Kingdom, that is to say facilitating home ownership for the whole population, clearly
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
does not go beyond the discretion which it undoubtedly retains in this field."</p></blockquote>
It is my contention that the Government have discretion in the matter and need not put standard rate value added tax on second homes. They should not argue that they must do so because of Community legislation. If they argue that it is for other reasons, such as needing the money, that is a different matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that having listened to what I have said, the Minister is prepared to think again about a problem that is important to the industry involved in supplying second homes and for those who wish to buy them. There may be existing contracts that will suddenly be subject to VAT. That could drastically change firms' and customers' budgeting. I ask the Minister to withdraw the order, consult the industry and return with new proposals later in the Session.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.03 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to hear that the various meetings that the Minister and her officials have had with representatives of the industry have brought so little result. A problem has been created because the Minister offered no modification or time to consider it further. She should be aware of that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not as if the matter is being considered in a logical background. The entire tax system, especially VAT, is hardly wholly logical or free from complications or exemptions. On the contrary, it is riddled with exemptions. If the exemption pattern is changed in a discriminatory way, as in this instance, new problems will be introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although there is an argument for newly constructed second homes to be subject to VAT, newly constructed regular homes being subject to VAT is a much more complicated case to argue. We can distinguish the second-home category and if we try to do so, certain difficult consequences follow. That is the basis of the many representations that have been received by members of the Committee and by some of my hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) has drawn to my attention a problem in his constituency. The Domaine Leisure Group has second homes and holiday homes in Carlyon Bay and Perran View that would be affected by the scheme. They are typical of developments that have been encouraged by the tourist industry in various parts of the country. There is an especially large number of such dwellings in the attractive area of Cornwall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is equally obvious in my constituency, where there are fewer purpose-built holiday homes. Perhaps that is why considerable pressure is placed on people to buy dwellings that are not restricted in their use to second-home purposes. The Minister and I would have a pleasant day if we visited the village of Beadnell, in which the majority of houses are used as second homes. New properties available for use throughout the year are eagerly bought by people from Tyneside for use as second homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Order, people can buy homes in the village of Beadnell—which could be used to house local people—without having to pay VAT on them. However, if they bought a purpose-built second home that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0037">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
was limited in its use, they would be subject to VAT. Therefore, an incentive is offered to people to buy into the local housing stock. By citing the example of what happens in Beadnell, I am comparing like with like as people can buy new or existing properties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally strong pressure is put on the existing housing stock. Far more secondhand houses are available for sale than secondhand purpose-built second homes. More people would, therefore, be able to buy second homes without the immediate impact of VAT although, of course, it would affect the prices of such dwellings in the long term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pressure from people who want second homes to buy into local housing stock is felt keenly by the local authorities. For example, council houses, having been sold initially to tenants, are now being resold, and in some cases bought, for second-home use. My constituency has some delightful ex-council housing. I could take the Minister to villages such as Craster or Rock in which there are ex-council houses with beautiful sea or inland views. They can now be bought for second-home purposes. Those who are looking for second homes are often in a better financial position than local purchasers. Such people will not have to pay VAT if they buy an ex-council house in a coastal village in my constituency, but they will have to pay VAT if they buy a purpose-built holiday home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Order will put those who buy purpose-built homes at a disadvantage. Such dwellings are a beneficial development for the tourist industry as they do not eat into the local housing stock. I, along with many local authorities and tourist organisations, considered that such a development should be encouraged when it did not impinge on the attractiveness of the local environment. Indeed, some pleasant and satisfactory developments of that sort have been built.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the way in which homes can be restricted. The Order will make the planning authority the taxing authority. When a planning authority decides whether to make a specific development one that can be occupied only for a limited number of months, it is, after all, deciding which properties will be subject to VAT. It will become not the agent of HM Customs and Excise but an independent agent that decides which properties will be subject to VAT and which will not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a planning authority makes such a decision, it will not consider the merits or desirability of VAT but whether it is more appropriate for certain land to be use for a specific holiday development. It will also have to decide whether different pressures will be put on local services if a property is occupied all year as opposed to it being occupied purely for holiday purposes. Such a decision is difficult to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee who have such accommodation in their constituencies will know about the problems that arise when people enter second-home accommodation without their having permanent accommodation. Such people could say to the local authority at the end of the permitted season, "What are you going to do? Acording to your planning rules, I have to leave this property now, and I need to be rehoused." That is a difficult problem. There have also been difficulties in relation to the poll tax and the
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
standard community charge. We have had endless agruments about what constitutes a second home for this purpose and whether property restricted in its use should be subject to the same standard charge as one which is not. Customs and Excise has voluntarily entered a minefield through which local authorities are expected to steer the unwitting purchaser of such a property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I posed a question to which I hope that the Minister now has a definitive answer. What will happen if this limited status changes? Planning consent is not the law of the Medes and the Persians; it is not written on tablets of stone. It is not an easy issue on which to rest the taxation system. It can be changed on appeal and by a local authority's subsequent decision. It can also be changed in other circumstances during the course of the enforcement process, for example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A local authority may have made a planning decision some time before to restrict the use of certain properties when someone decides to use the property for different purposes. An example with which I am sure that you are familiar, Mr. Winterton, is the agricultural use condition. In many cases, such a condition is called into question by someone who may be retired from farming or have a vestigial connection with agriculture, and there is enormous difficulty in securing enforcement. That may lead to a successful appeal or the authority reviewing its planning policy for those properties. Such difficulties will also apply to second homes, with the added sting in the tail that a major tax factor is involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister replies, we shall presumably discover whether, if changes are made, the VAT position will change and anyone can reclaim the tax. That might apply particularly in the event of an appeal. Will it apply if the policies change later? Someone who has paid the extra 15 per cent. for his property will feel a great sense of injustice if a year later the local authority says that it made a mistake, by imposing the restriction and that it is changing its policy. If subsequent purchasers pay 15 per cent. less, I imaging that, as Members of Parliament, we will receive letters from many people who will be annoyed at that change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reiterate the request of the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) for some guidance from the Minister about what is happening in other countries. I am particularly interested to know the position in Spain, Portugal, France and Denmark. They all have purpose-built second homes owned by people in this country, and it is reasonable to make comparisons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not a fanatical advocate of VAT harmonisation. Indeed, I believe that the Government have been right to resist general VAT harmonisation, particularly for products purchased in a shop in one country and which at the point of sale will bear the same level of VAT from whichever country they come. However, in international comparisons there is a competition element. If it is significantly cheaper, because of the differential impact of tax, to purchase a seond home in another European country, that will defeat the purposes of free and fair trade in the European Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems clear that the Government are not under an obligation to do what they are doing. I agree with the hon. Member for Wrexham that we have been misled
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0038">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
in more recent statements. Earlier statements made by the then Economic Secretary led me to believe that the Government were acting of their own volition in this matter and were not under any European legal requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have stirred up a hornet's nest of problems. It would have been more sensible to defer the matter for further consideration and I am disappointed that the Minister has suggested that. I should be interested in her comments on some of my points. We may need to return to them before the end of our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.14 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buckley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure you that I shall be very brief, Mr. Winterton, so as to allow the Minister time to answer the very pertinent questions put by my hon. Friends about the proposed change in the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) the proposed change in the legislation dealing with the European Common Market. I believe that it arose out of the case between Her Majesty's Customs and Excise and the Haven Leisure company. Are the Government changing the legislation to give strength to Her Majesty's Customs and Excise in the middle of the VAT tribunal case, which may be appealed against by Customs and Excise itself? If that is the Government's purpose, their action is spurious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Finance Act 1989 specifically did not impose tax on holiday homes that could be lived in for most of the year. That was made clear publicly. I question the Government's intention in bringing forward the amendment to the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government, in their attempted review of the poll tax, laid great stress on giving consideration to tourist areas. They saw the dangers of the poll tax to areas where tourism is a major industry. The hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) spoke about some of the areas that are very dependent on tourism, and have many chalets and temporary holiday homes. I cannot, therefore, understand how the Government can have two different views on tourist areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Buying a property in France is the bargain of the age. Property prices in France—especially in the north—are fairly competitive compared with property prices in this country. There may be a major shift in property buying, with people investing in foreign properties rather than taking on the proposed VAT, which will be imposed on sites which are not licensed for permanent residents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ask the Minister about a problem that requires clarification. Permanent residents are permitted on some sites on the east coast. Most of the people who live there are retired. They own chalets and can
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
afford the leisure time to live in them permanently. On such sites, leisured accommodation must be permitted all year round. But what about people who have jobs and who cannot take advantage of that opportunity? They live there temporarily, for holiday periods, as work permits. Will they be exempt, as permanent residents are, or will they have to pay VAT?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I point to a further complication. On some sites, local authority planning consent permits a certain number of homes to be used for permanent occupation, but does not specify which.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buckley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Such complications seem to be inherent in the proposal. The hon. Gentleman spoke about planning permission and planning applications. What if the licensee suddenly decides to avoid paying VAT by saying, "Last year the property was for temporary purposes. Now it is permanent." The resident could have the licence changed to make the residence permanent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many complications. My hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham pointed out that it is a deliberate whack at the less wealthy members of the community. He outlined the differential between a permanent property and a chalet or beach hut. It is obvious that the less wealthy person will own the temporary accommmodation which will now be subject to VAT and the very wealthy person will have a permanent second home and avoid paying VAT. That will obviously distinguish between the poor and the rich.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have been pressing for the past three or four years to reduce direct taxation—income tax—saying that tax levels must come down. Yet the Government again intend to increase the revenue from indirect taxation; that has been the permanent policy of the Government since the election. Indirect taxation is being increased and income tax is being reduced; again, the less well off will suffer the consequences of that general policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is well known that the equalisation of VAT in Europe is coming. Even though the previous Prime Minister said that she would not allow the eradication of zero-rating for certain commodities, it is obvious that VAT will be equalised shortly. That is a strong indication that our VAT rate will increase by 2 per cent. or 3 per cent. The Minister should think again, and I hope that she will seriously consider the consequences spoken of by the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are heading into a minefield of complications on who does and who does not pay VAT. I hope that the Minister will review her thoughts on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.21 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillian Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Several interesting and some complex points have been made by the hon. Members for Wrexham (Dr. Marek), for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) and for Hemsworth (Mr. Buckley). First, I shall expand a little on the background to the order. Much has been made by those hon. Gentlemen of the lack of consultation and so on. I said in my introductory remarks that I would come back to those points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0039">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
I shall quote some correspondence and some extracts from Butterworth and from Tolley's books on VAT law. I said that the intention was made clear in the 1989 Budget. As hon. Members know, the order came into effect on 1 April 1989. On 13 April 1989, Customs and Excise wrote to the director general of British Holiday and Home Parks Association to say that, if a holiday chalet could not be occupied throughout the year, the grant of freehold or a long lease could not be zero-rated. The letter made that absolutely clear. Obviously, members of the Committee are free to see that correspondence. On 3 May, the association had a meeting with the Economic Secretary to the Treasury to define and discuss the implications of the legislation. Subsequently, on 11 May, the director general wrote back to Customs asking for further clarification. He said that he understood that
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the chalet is sold by the person constructing the chalet … as holiday accommodation on a restricted season/occupancy, then the sale or long lease would be subject to standard rate VAT. This standard rate would apply equally to the sale of new chalets, second hand chalets and refurbished chalets."</p></blockquote>
It seems to me that the position was quite clear in the mind of the British Holiday and Home Parks Association on 11 May. On 25 May, Customs wrote to the director general of the association confirming that point and saying that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where the chalet is sold or let as holiday accommodation its sale or letting is standard-rated … The above applies to both the lump sum payment for a freehold interest and to the premium payment for a leasehold interest."</p></blockquote>
On 5 June, the director general of the association replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have taken steps to advise our members of the position as verified by you."</p></blockquote>
The association was in no doubt about the effect of the provisions as stated on 1 April 1989. I take exception to the imputation that the measure is being rushed through. Matters were clearly understood in June 1989. To underline that, Tolley's "VAT on Construction, Land and Property" in August 1989 describes changes affecting holiday accommodation. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Note 4(a) prevents the zero-rating of (and thus standard rates) the grant of a major interest which is in effect 'time share'. Note 7(b) prevents the zero-rating of a major interest in accommodation which cannot lawfully be occupied as a permanent residence."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the movement of zero-rating, but it does not therefore follow, "And thus, standard rating." The tribunal said that exemption would apply in such cases once zero-rating was removed. There may have been correspondence between the industry and the Minister, but there seems to be undue haste. The Government could have taken the matter to appeal but chose not to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must refute that. I served as a member of the Committee that considered the Finance bill, as it then was, as did the hon. Gentleman. The intention is clear. Much of our discussion then centred on caravans. Butterworth's "VAT and Propery" of September 1989 makes it clear that
	<br><blockquote><p>"sales, lettings, etc of time-share, holiday or other accommodation which cannot lawfully be occupied throughout the whole of the year by the person to whom the dwelling is sold or let."</p></blockquote>
would be affected by mandatory standard-rate supplies. I hope that that reassures the Committee that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
Government want to restore the position that they believed had been established by the 1989 Budget and the Finance Act 1989.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Members for Wrexham, for Hemsworth and for Berwick-upon-Tweed made several points about whether charging VAT on purpose-built second homes with restricted occupancy would make their purchase in such villages as they described easier. I thank the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed for his invitation—he has a lovely constituency. My Norfolk constituency has some villages with second homes. There may be some overlap in prices between restricted-use holiday and leisure park accommodation and the local market for ordinary housing. It would be ludicrous to pretend otherwise. They are becoming separate markets. Several hon. Members will have received brochures from the association describing the accommodation on offer. Much of the accommodation is marketed in terms of the in-house facilities offered on the development, such as the golf course, the marina or fishing facilities. The local market consists of old and new housing with a wider range of types and prices suitable for different tastes and pockets. Many of us will have examples of such developments in our constituencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I see the force of the argument—and were I an Opposition member I might advance the same argument—it is an oversimplification to suggest that potential buyers of holiday homes look across the entire range of possibilities in an area. A young family or retired couple would be likely to focus on one sector according to their needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Housing problems in rural and other areas result from complex factors. Value added tax on such holiday and leisure park dwellings does not have a significant impact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Wrexham, for Berwick-upon-Tweed and for Hemsworth all mentioned the European Community and harmonisation. As the hon. Member for Hemsworth said, harmonisation of VAT rates is becoming the issue of the age. He will not get much comfort from what I say about the position in other members states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman wishes to see a network of extraordinary complexity and difference, he should study a table which I am happy to make available to him. In relation to house purchases, there is a range of different rates on new buildings in the other member states. In Luxembourg, all buildings are exempt. Second-hand buildings are exempt except in Italy, where people might have to pay 4 per cent. or 19 per cent. as they would pay on a new building. We do not think that there is a difference for holiday homes or second homes, but there may be other forms of taxation. Generally speaking, in other EC member states—unlike here—construction services are liable to VAT.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand why the question was put. It is right to look elsewhere, but when we look across the Channel we see a—I was going to say "mess"—great variety of different rates applied on housing in different member states. There is no reason why it should not be a "mess" as the states are applying their own rates, so it would be wrong to use that derogatory term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wrexham spoke strongly about the rural economy. We are all anxious about the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0040">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
economy; he expresses a generally held view. I hope that I have reassured him that the industry has known since 1989 that VAT was to be charged. I assume that it was being paid on dwellings constructed between that date and the date of the tribunal. It would have been charged, and one hopes that it follows that it was also being paid. I hope that the correspondence illustrates that the industry was aware of the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed spoke of a lack of logic. But there is a lack of logic in the present position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The homes are intended for holiday or leisure purposes. Those that will be affected by the order cannot be used for anything else, either through convenant or a planning permission condition. So, by definition, they are to be used for holiday or leisure purposes, yet they were not liable for VAT until 1 April 1989. So it would be logical to charge VAT on all holiday provision—it is already charged on hotels, restaurants and so on. That was part of the reason for the change made on 1 April 1989.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wrexham spoke about his parliamentary question and the answer that he received. I agree that the passage in the reply about European Community law as an oversimplification, although it was certainly rather long for a parliamentary answer. Having given up the zero-rating in 1989, partly on the merits of the case and partly because zero-rating was probably unlawful—the United Kingdom did not advance the argument that it was its social policy that people should have holiday homes—taxation of new freehold holiday homes was mandatory under articles 13B(b) and 4.3(a) of the sixth VAT directive. On leaseholds, article 13B(b) requires the taxation of accommodation
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the hotel sector or in sectors with similar function, including the provision of accommodation in holiday camps."</p></blockquote>
To the extent that long leases of holiday homes were not thought to fall within that formulation—I suppose that that could be described as a very upmarket holiday camp—member states are free to add their own bit of tax leasehold transactions under the tailpiece to article 13B(b), which says that member states may apply further exclusions to the scope of the exemption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Member states must apply any exemptions in a way that prevents any possible evasion, avoidance or abuse. It would be difficult to justify the exemptions for long leases of holiday homes when sales of such new homes have to be taxed, as do short lettings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have followed the Minister's remarks carefully. I refer the Minister to the opinion of the Advocate General of the European Court from which I quoted an extract on holiday homes. The European court later confirmed that because of the ambit of our housing policy it was permissible to have second homes. If that is not so, why have we not been taken to the European court again?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned leases under article 13B(b) of the sixth VAT directive. That states that exemptions can be allowed for hotels, holiday camps and camping sites. So it used to be perfectly reasonable to say that holiday homes that are not part of hotels or camp sites should be allowed and exemption under that article.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the logical reason to exempt such homes? I cannot believe that the hon. Gentleman would want to make such an exception for second holiday homes, but I am not trying to make a cheap political point. As it is mandatory to tax sales of such houses, the Government's position is to tax long leases on holiday homes. That is logical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we are now getting somewhere. The Government are not arguing that because of the sixth VAT directive leases should be taxed. That is progress. If it is mandatory to tax sales, I understand the logic of the argument and would agree with the Minister. However, I do not think that it is mandatory to tax the sales of houses because of the provisions of the sixth VAT directive and because of the opinion of the Advocate General and of the European Court's subsequent judgment on Britain's housing policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the Governments's view that taxation of new freehold holiday homes is mandatory under articles 13B(b) and 4.3A of the sixth VAT directive. I am pleased the the hon. Gentleman can appreciate the logic of extending that to leasholds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hemsworth asked about a property being restricted by covenant or planning permission and so being subject to VAT under the order and wondered whether VAT would be charged, regardless of the use made the person living in the property. I assumed that the hon. Gentleman meant the owner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buckley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are chalets on sites on the east coast whose occupants are permanent residents becasue they are retired. However, other occupants are only temporary residents. What is the position regarding the non-permanent residents?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had answered that already. If a property is restricted by covenant or planing permission and the owner who had bought it is therefore taxed, it is up the the owner what use he makes of it. The hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed referred to the complications facing local authorities, which would have to consider the VAT implications when granting planning permision and so on. I believe that local authorities have in mind other considerations when granting restricted planning permissions for holiday homes. Such considerations could be the familiar ones of protest from local people, overloading in a particluar community, or relieving the pressure on those buying up properties in the way described by the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that VAT considerations would weigh heavily on local authorities. However, the hon. Gentlemen wondered about estates in which some properties were subject to permanent occupation and others to planning permission restriction and suggested that people would not know which properties would be so restricted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My response is that, if a developer is given permission to develop, say, 100 houses in a holiday park of which one quarter must be set aside for non-permanent residence, it will be his responsibility to find out and to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0041">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
organise his lettings and sales in the appropriate manner. In any event, all such matters may be negotiated with the local authority, which will often be in favour of such developments and may be prepared to be flexible. I understand the point made by the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed, but it is a matter that can be resolved by negotiation between the developer and the local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That seems to be the nub of this morning's discussion. If a local authority is in favour of a development and does not want to discourage it by imposing that restriction, it could grant planning consent and retain, through its enormous input into the design, its ability to ensure that the end product would still be holiday homes. Does my hon. Friend mean that VAT will not be levied when a covenant or restriction is not imposed? If the Order is passed, will it mean that, while it must consider the VAT implications, it will be for the local authority alone to decide whether it wants the development?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the property is holiday accommodation that has restricted occupancy either because of a covenant or because of a planning permission condition, it will be subject to VAT.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there is none?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is another matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should answer the question posed by the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed. It just shows, Mr. Winterton, that one should never rashly suggest that an answer might be common sense, because the reply that I must give the hon. Gentleman is that VAT is chargeable at the time of the supply if there exists a planning constraint at that time. That is fair enough. Subsequent revocation of the planning constraint will affect only future supplies. However, the hon. Gentleman should also remember that the tax is not chargeable on resales of properties that are more than three years old. I hope that that satisfies the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Anthony Durant 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Reading, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister mentioned the three-year limit. Does that mean that a new applicant who after three years buys a holiday residence on which VAT has already been paid by the vendor will also have to pay VAT?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall reply to my hon. Friend in a moment when I have completed my replies to other hon. Members.

I wish to reassure Opposition Members that the Government are not trying to rush the Order through or to push the industry around because they have had second thoughts after the tribunal revealed that the legal way of executing the Government's intention was defective. The Order is intended to remedy that. The Government would refute the claim that the industry was unaware of the change. That is not the case, as I have illustrated by means of the correspondence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are not behaving in a draconian way. We are simply trying to introduce logic to the sphere of holiday accommodation. As the hon. Mem-
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
ber for Wrexham made clear, it is not a party political matter. In the Government's view, it is a question of finding a legal way of exercising the intentions that they expressed on 1 April 1989.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell my hon. Friend for Reading, West (Sir A. Durant), who was recently honoured, that a sale would be exempt after three years, but under three years it would depend on whether it was conducted in the course of business, in which case it would be taxable at 15 per cent., or whether it was a private sale, in which case it would be outside the scope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, during my discussions with representatives of the association, my attention was drawn to the plight of people who might have entered into a legally binding contract in the window between the announcement of the tribunal's decision and 1 February. They should not have done so, because the developers should have made them aware of the position. Those people could be in real trouble, and I take the point made by the hon. Member for Hemsworth that they might have limited means. Anyone would sympathise with people in that position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the circumstances, we want to prevent possible hardship for individuals who might have committed themselves to buying the freehold or long lease of one of the holiday dwellings during the period from the announcement of the Haven Leisure decision until the Government's decision to amend the law was made known in the Customs news release, but who cannot complete the transaction until on or after 1 February 1991. Bearing in mind the sizeable amounts of tax involved and the fact that, for various reasons, the Customs announcement was delayed, I am authorising Customs to implement an extra-statutory class concession that will give relief to private purchasers of those homes who entered a legally binding obligation to purchase or lease between 15 September 1990 and 31 December 1991, if the contract made no mention of VAT. The concession will apply only to the balance of the freehold price, or the premium price for the leasehold, paid on or after 1 February. Customs would expect to verify the entitlement by seeing the contractual document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I read that out in a rather stodgy way, but it is important to get the exact conditions correct and recorded in the 	<i>Official Report.</i> I hope that, in accepting the Order, the Committee will also feel that that concession goes some way towards recognising the difficulties of people who, through no fault of their own, might have financial problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for her reply. We have had a good debate and explored the subject, but there is still a difference of view between us. The Opposition believe that the balance is that the order should not go through, and no doubt the Minister and Conservative Members think that it should. That will be tested shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to a table. Could we all have it, please? It would be valuable to know what the position is in other member states of the European Community. The Minister said that a solution might be that VAT on second homes should be charged across the board. I have some sympathy with that. The problem is that that cannot be done realistically and, therefore, it should not be done at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0042">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
The Minister relied on that fact that it was mandatory to put VAT on the sale of homes. I take issue with her on that. The Minister referred to the sixth VAT directive, article 13B(b), and article 4.3(a), but those must be tempered by the second VAT directive, article 17. If the Minister carefully considers all that in context, together with the Advocate General's opinion and the view expressed by the European Court, she could sustain the argument that it was not necessary to put VAT on either long leases or the sale of houses. Obviously, if the tax applies to one it should to the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the arguments about the social split and divisions that the order will create between those who are wealth enough to buy an ordinary dwelling and those who have to buy a purpose built holiday home must prevail. For that reason, I ask my hon. Friends to vote against the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
