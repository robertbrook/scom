	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Community charge Benefits (General) Amendment (No. 3) Regulations 1990.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the leave of the Committee, we shall also consider the following: The Income Support (General) Amendment No. 3 Regulations 1990, the Housing Benefit (General) Amendment (No. 2) Regulations 1990 and the Family Credit (General) Amendment No. 2 Regulations 1990.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some important points are raised by the statutory instruments. The problem of pensioners and other people with savings who are living on benefits has come up time and again. Because they have savings, many are not entitled to benefits. On several ocassions the Government had to change their policy because of its cruelty. The problem also faces people who get compensation. In my area a number of women who have got compensation for rape from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board have had their benefits stopped because of the level of compensation. I know of two recent cases of people who got compensation from the Ministry of Defence for injuries or illnesses which arose from serving in the forces but which were recognised only later. The compensation put right an old wrong, but the consequence was that their benefit entitlement was reduced. This is a serious and sensitive issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The four statutory instruments deal with among other things, the treatment of notional capital in assessing entitlement to means-tested benefits. They cover income support, family credit, housing benefit and poll tax benefit. Under the old supplementary benefit regulations a person who had deprived himself or herself of capital by spending it would be treated as still possessing it, but there was room for discretion, which was used to reduce the notional capital over time. I am sure that Conservative Ministers have had the same sort of cases as I have. Was buying a carpet legitimate expenditure, or was someone deliberately reducing his or her capital to change his or her benefit entitlements? The notional capital was reduced over time so that the money would eventually be treated as having been spent on normal living expenses and the person would be entitled to benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the Government's horrendous social security reforms in 1988, that discretion no longer exists and there is doubt as to the legality of treating notional capital as diminishing. In a recent case, the tribunal of commissioners
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
took the view that the diminishing capital rule still applied, and pointed out that if a claimant had actual capital, he or she could reduce it by
	<br><blockquote><p>"reasonable expenditure on living and other sensible expenses (which we do not consider need be limited to the relevant amount of income support…)".</p></blockquote>
That is an important question for the Government. Must people with large lumps of capital spend at the level of benefits, or is it reasonable for them to spend a bit more because, as we all know, living on benefits is very difficult? The commissioners suggest that it would be reasonable for people to spend more than the minimal level that benefits allow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department of Social Security solicitor conceded the point. The commissioners said that the same should apply to notional capital and that the claimant should be entitled
	<br><blockquote><p>"to be deemed to diminish that capital by reasonable expenditure related to his own particular financial and other circumstances".</p></blockquote>
That it is not necessarily the same as the amount of income support that he receives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statutory instruments remove any doubt as to whether the diminishing capital rule still applies. We welcome that. The rule is written into the regulations for the four benefits. But they limit the rate of diminution to the amount of benefit forgone. If Conservative Members vote for them today, the regulations will assume that if the claimant still possesses capital, she or he would spend at the same rate as if they had no capital. That is what adjudication officers are instructed to assume at present. Plainly, that is unrealistic and raises an important question. Consider the case of an elderly person, living on income support, who had been raped and received compensation from the Criminal Injuries Compansation Board. If she spends a penny above what would have been her income support level, she is assumed to have spent that capital. Such people are not allowed to treat themselves in any way without forgoing future entitlement to benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal is mean, insensitive and unfair. I understand the need for the regulations because we must have the discretion to deal with notional capital, but why be so mean? Could not we be a little more generous and allow people, within reason, to spend amounts of their capital on normal, reasonable expenditure? People who have saved that capital or who may have received a lump sum because of hardship in their lives should be allowed to spend a little more than income support levels without being penalised as the Government suggests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another anomaly in present practice, which the statutory instruments would write into the regulations. For the purposes of housing and poll tax benefit, the capital is assunmed to diminish only by the amount of the benefits forgone, ignoring any income support or family credit forgone. That is convenient, because discovering how much income support or family credit claimants may have been entitled to if they had not had their capital would be a nightmare, but it is also unfair. The obvious solution is to allow a more generous rate of diminishing. That would allow for the possible loss of other benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is my main point but I also want to ask the Minister about more detailed matters. Some of them have been brought to our attention by the Child Poverty Action Group. With regard to regulation 51A, that body is worried about the provision in paragraph 5, which appears to require intervals of at least 26 weeks between
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0544">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
redeterminations of the amount of the reduction of the notional capital. I have great sympathy with the point made by the Child Poverty Group that there should be no limit on when such recalculations can be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, what will happen if there is a relevant change of circumstances two weeks into the 26-week period, such as the birth of a child, a child moving into a different age band, an uprating and so on? Furthermore, if there are to be any restrictions on when a redetermination can take place, claimants could need advice about the timing of further claims so that they do not make them just before an uprating or when a relevant change in circumstances is likely to occur. The effect of that restriction on recalculation of the reduction of the notional capital could be that a claimant would have to use up her or his notional capital at a rate below the amount of the person's income support entitlement for up to 25 weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister can reassure me on that point. If someone makes a claim, is refused and has a change of circumstances one week later, he or she will be penalised for six months because of the rigidity of the regulations. That seems deeply unfair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the diminishing notional capital rule, the Child Poverty Action Group felt that reduction by the rate of income support entitlement alone was not sufficient. A figure should be built in to recognise that those claimants will have no access to free school meals and other passported benefits such as free dental treatment, prescriptions and so on. Furthermore, they will have, no access to community care grants and budgeting loans while they are not getting income support. In addition, and most importantly, an element of discretion should be introduced to allow reduction of notional capital at a reasonable rate above income support level in appropriate circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is my general point, but a specific matter is most important. While such people are expected to live on their capital, and so cannot claim income support, they will not get the passported benefits. Therefore, they will be even worse off than they would have been had they been on income support at that time. That is gravely unjust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If people can lose a severe disability premium as a result of the changes to regulation 3(2)(d), will the Government arrange for a concessionary payment, re-awarding the amount of transitional protection lost that was first awarded under that regulation? That payment could be along the lines of the special concession made when people lost their severe disability premium following the October 1989 change to regulation 3(2)(c). That sounds technical, but it is most important to those with severe disabilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it right that under regulation 57(l)(b), payment of maintenance in respect of a child should be attributed to the needs of anyone other than that child? The effect of that rule could be to take a woman and her children off income support for a time, which could lead to the loss of passported benefit. It could also discourage fathers from making such payments. Whatever arguments we may have about the Government's proposals, we all agree that absent parents—usually fathers—should maintain their children. That is yet another discouragement and a potential injustice. It is wrong that income from maintenance can be attributed to someone other than the child for whom it is paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why does the carers premium in new paragraph 14ZA of Schedule 2 have to be restricted to people in receipt of invalid care allowance? Why will not the fact of caring itself
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
suffice? Pensioners still will not have their caring role recognised if they are too old to apply for invalid care allowance. People live for so long now that it frequently happens that those caring for frail elderly people are often pensioners also. That happened when my mother cared for her mother and it is quite common nowadays. That group of people is not entitled to invalid care allowance. The carers permium will not be applicable while the people being cared for are serving the qualifying period for attendance allowance or have to resatisfy the residence test if they have been abroad for more than six months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will reconsider the meanness of the level of diminution of notional capital. That will lead to many appallingly cruel cases, which will embarrass the Government and, more important, will hurt people. I hope that the Minister can give a considered response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.42 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I generally support what has been said and I congratulate the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms. Short) and the official Opposition on seeking the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations are not complicated, but they dramatically affect a great many people. Although the regulations are already in force, it is important that we scrutinise positively and constructively some of the detailed technicalities. We all know of occasions when the House, as a legislative institution, has produced legislation that is difficult to interpret and that causes public confusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister say how much money and how many claimants are covered under the heads of the regulations that are being changed? We should know whether we are talking about thousands, millions or even tens of millions of pounds. For example, what is at stake under the changes to the diminishing notional capital rule? Has the Department made any estimate of what levels of benefit are being increased, decreased or denied to people by changes in the regulations? May we have an estimate of how many claimants will be affected by the changes?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not repeat the arguments made by the hon. Member for Ladywood. She argued succinctly the case made by advice bureaux, Child Poverty Action Group advisers and law centres to look at the justification for the change. I am sceptical about the regulations. I know that the matter was discussed in Standing Committee on the Social Security Bill but neither the Minister nor myself was involved in those discussions. We are therefore at a slight disadvantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that in the House of Lords, Lord Carter argued that the proposed diminishing notional capital rule should be included in legislation, hence the regulations. To that extent, the regulations are a sensible and welcome move. They will help to erase the confusion in the way in which the rule is being implemented. That is understandable, except that they completely miss the point. In 1989 the commissioners' decision, CIS 334/89, made it clear that the confusion had been resolved by taking forward the notional capital rule potentially more positively for claimants and beneficiaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government were aware of the commissioners' decision and that an avenue was open to place claimants covered by the rule in a much better position. Why did not the Government opt for that route rather than Lord Carter's suggestion, positive though it was at the time, to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0545">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
remove the discretion in the system that caused the problem and to make the notional capital rules mandatory through the regulations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subject to what the Minister tells me about the money involved—that is a sensible and responsible consideration in any public expenditure—the Committee must be told why the Government decided to go down the avenue offered to them by Lord Carter as opposed to the commissioners' decision, which would have made the rules more generous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members will say that, all other things being equal, our experience is that the rules are not generous, although they may be necessary. I cannot say to the Committee that we must not have a capital rule because the gratuitous alienation of funds has to be taken into account by any Government. The notional capital rules are stringent, but that is an argument for another time and another place. However, it is safe to say that the regulations, which concern the diminishing notional capital rule, eniiti? us to an explanation of why the Government deciioi to deal with the matter in this way and not accept the con nrrissioners' decision and make the rules more generous. The Government could have homologated, accepted and implemented that decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Something the hon. Gentleman said made me wonder whether he realises that the regulations will make matters worse. For example, when people are made redundant—unfortunately we are going into a period of redundancies—they fix up their houses, buy carpet and so on until their money has gone. When they then apply for benefit, they will be crawled over. If they spend their money at a faster rate than income support, which will be meaner than in the past, they will be refused all benefit. They will have no income although they have not spent their money in any way that would have been considered unreasonable in the past. The test will be that people can spend their money only at income support level and nothing higher.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am confused by that question, although I think that it was sympathetic to my argument. I am not saying that the position should be made more stringent. I understand that, as a result of the commissioners' decision, adjudication officers were given far more discretion in extending the amount to which capital could have been diminished, without benefit being penalised. I am sorry if I gave the hon. Lady an impression that was contrary to that view; that was not my intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want as much benefit as possible to be made available to bona fide claimants who have genuinely disposed of capital in a way that does not deny them benefit in future. I agree with the hon. Lady's argument and I support entirely the view advanced by the CPAG advisers. The Government have a case to answer in that direction, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The changes in disregarded income are not controversial. I think that everyone welcomes the extensions, to both disregarded income and disregarded capital. However, why stop there? When the Government formulated those regulations, did they consider the possibility of extending disregarded income and disregarded capital to other regulations? There is a strong case for extending disregarded income and disregarded capital to other categories that fall within the social security system. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
Government have the power under the regulations to do so. If the Government did not consider doing that, will the Minister explain why?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer now to the carer's premium under the income support, housing benefit and community charge regulations. I stand to be corrected, but I understand that the new premium for carers that was announced by the Secretary of State for Social Security in his uprating statement in 1989 is to be paid to people who receive invalid care allowance for caring for a relative. That also covers those who would otherwise have been in receipt of invalid care allowance, but who do not qualify for it because they receive a benefit that overlaps with ICA, such as widows' pensions. There is a potential problem in that provision to which I should like the Minister's response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some claimants are put in a difficult position as a result of the new premium. I understand from having read a research note from the Library that the entitlement to a carer's premium may have a knock-on effect on the person being cared for. some carers on income support do not claim invalid care allowance as it would not make them any better off. Furthermore, the person being cared for may qualify for severe disability premium under the calculations for income support. Under paragraph 13 of schedule 2 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987, one of the conditions for that premium is that no other person is in receipt of invalid care allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a carer claims invalid care allowance to qualify for the carer's premium from October, the person who is being cared for may lose his entitlement to severe disability premium. A disabled person may still qualify for a disability premium, but that is £12.80 per week less than the severe disability premium. I accept that such jargon is difficult to digest, but a potential anomaly is enshrined in the regulations in respect of people who are caring for disabled people. I hope that I have made my point in a way that is comprehended, and I should be obliged if the Minister would respond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The changes affecting non-dependants under the income support and housing benefit regulations clarify the position in a sensible way. the changes in the housing benefit and community charge benefit regulations dealing with the amount of income to be disregarded from a lone parent's earnings are sensible, too, and they will help. For the life of me, I cannot understand why the Government are not more generous in the charitable and voluntary payments provisions of the regulations. The Minister may say that big sums are involved, which could cause me to change my view. Will the Minister tell us why the disregards are being introduced and why third-party payments could not have been more generous? That could be done at little cost and enhance the role of voluntary bodies and charities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not necessarily in favour of an enhanced role for charities, as state benefits should enable people to have an independent existence without resort to charity. There is scope, in limited circumstances, for increased payments. Charities and voluntary organisations are willing to assist, although their funds are strained. A more radical approach to the work of such charities should be used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are changes in community charge benefit regulations for new partners I hope that the Minister has consulted local authority organisations about such changes. I understand that guidance manuals for authorities include information on that. Leaving aside arguments about the poll tax, I am worried about the

smothering effect of the bureaucracy. Even in rural local authorities, such as the one in my constituency in southeast Scotland, which is efficient and where most people reluctantly pay the community charge, community charge officers find it almost impossible to cope with the layers of administrative work. Other members of the Committee will know more about such problems, as they represent urban constituencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The changes that the Government are making are not objectionable. They are perfectly sensible, but I wonder whether the Government have properly consulted local authorities to ensure that these changes will not significantly increase their work. I suspect that, that will not happen, but I should like to be assured that such changes are made only after thorough consultations with local authorities to ensure that they do not add to the administrative misery and chaos that is already extant due to the poll tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My tone may seem carping, but we are entitled to ask the Government about detailed issues to ensure that possible hiccups are ironed out of the legislation. It is barmy that the regulations can only be discussed after their implementation. I hope that my questions about costs are answered sensibly. Obviously, some of those matters are technical and, if the answers are available but the Minister does not have them to hand, I hope that she will be kind enough to write to me with the details.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Miss Ann Widdecombe)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the Opposition on the detailed way in which they have examined the amendments and on their interesting arguments this morning. I am especially grateful to the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) for his kind offer to accept responses in writing, but I can respond now to most of the points that were raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was somewhat surprised that Opposition Members saw fit to challenge four sets of regulations that are overwhelmingly beneficial to claimants. Even where the Government were challenged on the detail of the proposals, I was pleased at the general welcome to the change of rules on notional capital and other matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall answer the specific questions posed shortly, but shall start by outlining some of the most important changes that have been introduced to income-related benefit schemes by the regulations before us and explaining their effects on individual claimants. It has been rightly said that many of the regulations are already in force. Under the two main changes that were introduced last October, as many as 30,000 carers and 65,000 lone parents stand to gain up to £10 a week at a total cost of more than £25 million a year. I draw that figure to the attention of the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will recall that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security announced his proposals for the carer premium back in October 1989 as part of a 20-point plan to improve the position of long-term sick and disabled people. At the same time, he made clear his intentions to provide extra help for working lone parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those two groups have been particularly considered by the regulations, which have given effect to those commitments by introducing the new carer premiums of £10 a week into income support, housing benefit and
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
community charge benefit and by increasing the earnings disregard in housing and community charge benefits for lone parents. The carer premium provides an improvement in the position of about 30,000 of our poorest carers. Many had no premium at all before October and the regulations recognise the wholly legitimate worries that were expressed about that extremely deserving group of claimants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Carers qualify for the premium in income support, housing benefit or community charge benefits if they receive an invalid care allowance. They also qualify if they have claimed invalid care allowance since the premium was introduced, but cannot receive it because they claim another benefit. That ensures that no one will be disadvantaged because of the overlapping benefit rules. For example, widows who are carers will have access to the premium.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it hard to believe that the Opposition would wish to remove those improvements from the statute book. Although I accept that they are challenging some of the detail, it is crucial to stress that the regulations are wholly beneficial and I hope that they will be welcomed by the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind hon. Members that we shall extend the scope of the premium from October this year and that the premium will continue for up to eight weeks after the caring role stops. I should add that during this time, former carers can receive income support, including the premium, without the need to make themselves available for work, which will give them time to adjust to their new circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The particular needs of another group of claimants was also very much in our minds when we decided to increase the lone parent earnings disregard in both housing and community charge benefits. In so doing, we have recognised that many lone parents who want to work can face extra problems because of the need to combine the roles of both child-career and breadwinner. Lone parents on housing and community charge benefits already receive additional help—an enhanced lone parent premium. Prior to the implementation of the regulations, the first £15 of their earnings was ignored. That amount was higher than for many single people and couples. However, under the regulations before us today, we have increased that amount by over 60 per cent., to £25. We have targeted that improvement on lone parents in full time work or not otherwise on income support. We estimate that about 65,000 working lone parents will benefit from this measure, which will provide a real incentive to those who wish to return to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much has been made this morning of capital. Before dealing with the details about that, we should consider the improvements that have been made overall. The hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms. Short) mentioned the problem of those who receive payment in consequence of personal injury. We have ensured that where the payment is used to set up a trust fund, the value of the fund and of the right to receive payment in accordance with the trust will be disregarded for an indefinite period, when previously, the value was only disregarded for two years. We have tried to help in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change also recognises that an injured person may have or may develop long-term needs, and provides greater flexibility for these to be met. Existing rules already allow for certain payments to be made from trust funds for various purposes. We have also taken steps to ensure that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0547">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
self-employed people who are temporarily unable to work because of sickness or disability do not have the value of their business assets taken into account for income-related benefit purposes. That means that those assets will not exclude them from benefit eligibility, nor reduce the amount of benefit to which they are entitled. I am sure that the Committee will welcome this change, which will remove some of the anxiety felt by the self-employed who may need to claim for a few weeks because of ill health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also clarified the position with regard to payments made in respect of prescriptions and other NHS charges, payments for travelling expenses to attend hospital or visit prison, and cash payments in lieu of milk tokens. Hitherto, there was some confusion about the way in which regular payments relating to these expenses should be treated in the income-related benefit. The regulations put it beyond all doubt that all these payments should be fully disregarded—a very beneficial measure indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In disregarding arrears of special payments to pre-1973 war widows, we have fulfilled the Government's pledge that these would not affect entitlement to income-related benefit. Regular £40 a week special payments are already fully disregarded, along with up to £10 per week of war widows or war disablement pension. We wanted to clarify in law that arrears of these payments made in lump sums should not affect benefit entitlement either. The regulations make specific provision for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now deal with an issue that has been widely debated this morning—the diminution of notional capital. Hon. Members will be aware that we are dealing with deprivation of capital—the crucial issue—for the purpose of securing entitlement to benefit. That seems to have been overlooked in some of the arguments that have been made earlier. We have decided that the crucial fact to be established is not that a person has deprived himself of capital but that he has deprived himself of his capital for the specific purpose of enhancing his right to benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know of these cases from advice bureaux in my constituency. We faced horrendous levels of redundancy in the early 1980s—especially in the west midlands. Many men in their 50s were made redundant and received large amounts of money—about £10,000 or £12,000. Of course they did not claim benefit then. They might often treat a grandchild or do up the house with their money and subsequently arrive to claim benefit. In those circumstances, how they disposed of their capital was examined. The authorities wanted to know about everything they had spent, and receipts had to be produced. These people were not making any calculations about acquiring the right to benefit. The hon. Lady is trying to reassure us in a rather misleading way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Widdecombe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not trying to mislead the Committee. I am trying to reassure the hon. Lady about the starting point, which is defined not in terms of a person who had deprived himself of capital, but of one who has deliberately and wilfully deprived himself of it in order to gain a better position for benefit. If the officer is not satisfied that that is the case, then these rules will not apply. If a redundant person has spent money for reasonable purposes—keeping up rents, repaying mortgages and the like—the mere fact that some of his capital has been disposed of will not count against him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
However, the question posed by the hon. Lady about what would happen to people who had spent their capital buying carpets and doing up their houses is important. A difficult judgment has to be made. Our intention is to safeguard taxpayers' money and to ensure that it is used properly to help those in genuine need. Without a specific reason for such expenditure, it is difficult to justify paying out benefits, which are collected from the taxes of both low and high earners, to people who have deliberately used money to enhance substantially the quality of their lives. However, the crucial starting point is that such people must be judged to have done so with the deliberate intention of depriving themselves of capital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Member for Ladywood is reassured by that. I suspect that her real complaint is not with the law's intent, but with its implementation, and that she has found one or two cases in which people have honestly believed that they were entitled to act as they did before becoming eligible for benefit. That is a different matter, but the law is clear: the motivation behind the deprivation of capital must be to secure additional benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is fine as far as it goes, but the hon. Member for Ladywood was right to say that in practice the rule is extremely onerous in individual cases and that when it goes wrong, it is 100 per cent, wrong. The matter is impossible to test, and I shall give the Minister a rather ludicrous example. Let us suppose that a person, in good faith, takes a world cruise, unaware that that gratuitous alienation would deprive him or her of future benefit. According to the Minister's explanation of the system this morning, that person would be entitled to full benefit. He or she would not be liable to be penalised because, having acted in good faith, there would have been no intention of getting round the benefit rules. However, in such circumstances, I do not believe that the adjudication system would allow that person to claim benefit, even though the letter of the law had been observed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Widdecombe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member makes a clear case for the necessity of rules about deprivation of capital. It is dubious practice for a person to take a world cruise when he is made redundant and has no expectations of future employment and then, on returning, to ask the taxpayers— many of whom may never have taken a trip to Brighton, let alone a world cruise—to pay for him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need the notion of capital rules. The changes that the Government have introduced have tried to cater for people such as the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire described by making it clear that any attempt on their part to deprive themselves of capital should not be held against them in perpetuity. The expenditure rate is restricted to the rate of income support because that is how such people would be supported and it represents the degree to which they would benefit from their actions. If we are to clarify the rules and ensure that people are not discriminated against in perpetuity, we need clear guidelines for calculation procedures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is trying to reassure her hon. Friends and, without being deliberately misleading, is making the picture overly rosy. Before 1988, the commissioners had discretion to examine how people had spent their money. Professional people who were always able to find employment easily, such as the many skilled men in the west midlands in the early 1980s, might very well
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0548">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
have decided, on acquiring a suitable sum of money, to go on a world cruise, secure in the knowledge that they would find employment on their return. They would have acted completely honestly, only to find that the labour market had changed in their absence and that they could not get a job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past, there was discretion to examine each individual case and to make a fair judgment in all the circumstances. That is all being changed. There will be no discretion and no rule other than expenditure at income support level. Many good people who spent money in good faith will be affected. People in the community that I represent often treat their children and grandchildren out of their redundancy money. They will end up with no income to live on. The Government are getting rid of the reasonable system we used to have and are imposing a rigid, mean-minded system that will penalise many decent people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Widdecombe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The crucial point for the hon. Lady to understand is that these decisions are taken with proper consideration of all the facts. She now suggests that discretion is removed to such an extent that the question of good faith will never enter into it. That is not true, reasonable and sensible expenditure on, for example, household furniture or a holiday will be accepted unless there is overwhelming evidence that the expenditure was made with a view to deliberately worsening the person's position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we get bogged down any further, Opposition Members must agree that it is entirely reasonable to expect that people with capital resources should use them to maintain themselves. These rules are trying first to ensure that those who have not done so will not have that held against them for ever. Secondly, they aim to give firm guidance on how to calculate exactly what it is reasonable to expect such people to have spent. It is overwhelmingly beneficial, the discretion is not being removed in so far as the officer must satisfy himself that it was not done deliberately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minsiter give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Widdecombe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall take one, and only one, more intervention on this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with the Minister and I shall try to be brief. She is saying two different things. No Opposition Member actively seeks to use taxpayer's money to support people who have gone out of their way to get round the system by spending money with the intention of circumventing the benefit rules. The test that the Minister has set out is not whether the expenditure is reasonable, but whether it was done in good faith.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even in a court of law with all the rules of evidence available to judges, it is impossible to test the intention in the mind of the person unless one has the omniscience of the Archangel Gabriel. It is not a question of reasonableness in terms of the expenditure but a question of what was in the claimant's mind when he spent the money that puts him into the realms of the benefit rules. The Minister does not understand that. She does not understand the difficulties that adjudication officers face day in and day out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Widdecombe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do understand that difficulty, but the only option other than allowing that a person may not have deliberately deprived himself of capital is to assume that he did. We are trying to introduce a measure that is overwhelmingly beneficial. We heard much about how the previous case law allowed endless discretion. Apparently, that is not the case. The case law that we have built is exactly the same as that which existed under supplementary benefit before these regulations. The element of discretion is the same. What is now beneficial is the help offered to those people who would not previously have qualified and who could have ended up never qualifying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further beneficial change that these regulations introduce relates to the treatment of charitable and voluntary payments. The Committee will be aware that the first £10 of any regular payment of a charitable or voluntary nature may be ignored when calculating entitlement to housing benefit or community charge benefit. People are free to spend the payments in any way they wish, including those day-to-day living expenses such as clothing and fuel. These regulations go considerably further and provide that charitable and voluntary payments that are intended and used for items other than food, clothing, footwear or fuel, all those housing costs and charges already catered for in benefit, will also be fully disregarded in the calculation of housing benefit and community charge benefit. That change brings these two benefits into line with income support and family credit and has been widely welcomed by charities and claimants alike.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee might appreciate an example of how the change can help. An elderly claimant whose family helps with telephone bills and television rental will gain from the change. Previously, only £10 of the weekly value of that help would have been disregarded; now, the full amount will be disregarded. Again, that is a beneficial change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another such change involves the non-dependant deductions in housing benefit and income support. Usually, deductions are made from benefits when the claimant has a non-dependant, such as a grown-up son or daughter, living in the household. That is because it is reasonable to assume that the non-dependant is contributing to the claimant's housing costs. The regulations take into account the position of parents of students who return to the family home during the long summer vacation, but who are unable to find work or who choose not to work. Deductions will no longer be made regarding students during the summer vacation unless the student is in remunerative work. That is a positive step that will help low income families with a student member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have deliberately confined my remarks to the main changes in the regulations, which introduce many important improvements for claimants. I shall not bother the Committee with the other technical changes—the Opposition have not raised them either—that are needed to clarify the existing policy intention. Suffice it to say that the changes are necessary to assist the assessing authorities in calculating benefit entitlement and they are not detrimental to claimants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to some of the specific points raised this morning, as we have more or less fully covered disregard of expenditure of notional capital. We are required in law to consult local authority associations about proposed changes to housing benefit and community charge benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0549">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
We have done so in respect of these regulations. There was concern about whether we had taken full regard of the effect on local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the very beneficial changes for charitable claimants, we have been asked why we have not been even more generous. As usual, the cry is, "You have done something wonderful, but you haven't gone far enough. That has dominated the Opposition's arguments this morning. The changes were made following lengthy consultation with many charities, and they have been widely welcomed. They provide ample scope for helping claimants in many ways—for example, as I have already mentioned, where they receive help from their families. Interestingly, a charity said that its funds were not limitless, as has been suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about the carer who qualifies for invalid care allowance for the first time, its relation with the carer premium and the effect on the disabled persons benefit. I am glad that this crucial point was raised. It is intended that the severe disability premium enables people to buy in care. It does not go to disabled people with a carer who receives invalid care allowance in respect of that care, as that would be a double provision from public funds. The receipt by the carer of invalid care allowance, disqualifies the disabled person from entitlement to the severe disability premium. That has been the case since April 1988 and there are no plans to change it at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That probably covers most of the points raised. The new regulations are overwhelmingly beneficial. I am sorry that the Opposition sought to out-lament Jeremiah this morning in their castigation on points of detail. The changes have been introduced to benefit those who were caught by the rules before and will help them in a generous and sensible way. The regulations are humane, and I commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.24 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Audrey Wise 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Preston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for being a few minutes late this morning. However, my apology is slightly muted by the fact that this Committee is at least four months late, as the regulations came into operation on 1st October. I add my complaint to those made about the ridiculousness of this procedure. Even if what is currently unthinkable happened, and we convinced Conservative Members—something that is not impossible because of the balance in the House, although in a tight House, changes to legislation can be made—there would be chaos. It is a gross misuse of parliamentary time to have this debate four months late.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall start where the Minister finished, on the carers' premium. The hon. Lady missed the point made by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) that in the past, not all carers entitled to invalid care allowance claimed it because it did not benefit them if they were on income support but that now they had an incentive for claiming it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has acknowledged that when carers claim invalid care allowance and receive the premium, the severe disability premium for the person being cared for will be obliterated. The hon. Gentleman's point was that in the past, carers had not claimed invalid care allowance because it did not benefit them. Now that they have an incentive, presumably more people will claim the allowance. Unless the Minister can answer the point made by the hon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, it stands. Giving the carer's premium to some carers will involve taking away the severe disability premium from some of those who are being cared for. The Minister did not grapple with that point, so I reiterate the question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the regulations were almost wholly beneficial. She did not tell us which parts, in the Government's estimation, are not. It would be interesting to have the Government's views on the circumstances in which they are taking back with one hand some of the benefits that they are giving with the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister castigated the Opposition for their intense application to detail. However, my understanding is that statutory instruments are all about detail. My experience as a constituency Member of Parliament is that the detail that Governments get wrong can leave people very poor. As my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms. Short) said, while that may be only a detail to the Committee, for the people affected by the regulations, it is a question of whether they have an income at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not taken sufficient account of the fact that statutory instruments are about detail. It is bad enough, that the Government pass primary legislation knowing that it is an empty shell, but it takes the cake when we are castigated for dealing with detail when considering regulations that are about just that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the details are extremely worrying. The Minister may think that we have finished with the issue of capital diminution, but that is because she has come to the end of her arguments. She has not answered the case put by my hon. Friend the Member for Ladywood and by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that everything hinges on the purpose for which the money has been spent—whether that was to secure entitlement—explodes the charade. It is impossible to judge whether the purpose was to secure entitlement or simply to make reasonable use of a sum of money, as people would feel that they were entitled to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that it would be difficult to make a case for allowing someone to improve his quality of life at the expense of other taxpayers, many of whom are poor. That depends on one's point of view. In my opinion, it is reasonable for someone to use his money to improve or repair his house, to acquire items that he knows will wear out and not be replaceable through income support. The more people know about the Government's regulations, the more worried they will be about their ability to buy new sheets, carpets and other items for their homes because they know that under the regulations the money made available simply does not allow for the replacement of such consumer durables. If they try to bring their homes up to standard, who is to say mat they do so to secure entitlement?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In effect, we are asking for the judgment of Solomon, and that simply will not work. The Minister said that there was no alternative, but there is, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ladywood said. The diminution rules could be more generous. The Government have no hesitation in deeming people to receive income from capital that they do not receive. Why should they be so cavalier in the opposite direction? Why should they assume that people can only spend at income support level when they are happy to assume in other circumstances that people receive income from capital that they do not receive? There is no
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0550">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
consistency in the Government's approach except on one aspect: in each case it is worse for the claimant. But that will not convince the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of my constituents who was in poor health had a capital sum obtained from the sale of a house. She spent money on living for a while in a better climate. She probably lengthened her life and, of course, made herself more of a charge on the taxpayer by so doing. But who is to say that it was unreasonable for her to do that? My constituent's doctor told her that a change of climate would be better for her health. Indeed, there is quite a lot of medical evidence to show that people who go to warmer climates can benefit. My constituent was treated as having robbed herself of her capital to obtain benefit. She had done no such thing. After some time, but sooner than would be allowed under this regulation, I managed to persuade the relevant authorities to re-examine her case. But that could not be done under this stringent detail. That is wholly unreasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that someone goes to Canada for the first time to visit his or her grandchildren. Will that be regarded as being done for the purpose of receiving benefit or simply because that person wants to see his or her grandchildren?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cultural differences will emerge in how people consider it reasonable to spend their money. My hon. Friend the Member for Ladywood spoke about how people behave in her community. However, no discretion will be permitted. There will simply be an unreasonable judgment of Solomon about the purpose for which money has been spent. That is totally unsatisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister gave the game away when she spoke about someone going away with no expectation of a job. No doubt it is assumed that those who are redundant have every expectation of a job. Back in 1986, they might have thought that there would be a change of Government and that they would get jobs. They may be unaccustomed to being redundant, they may have skills which were saleable in their area but are not longer so. But apparently none of those factors will be taken into account because it will be impossible for such people to show that they did not have in mind the securing of entitlement. It would be impossible to prove that. The Government are asking people to look inside other people's heads, and that is impossible. The Minister has not answered those points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are entitled to say that the Government should have considered, and should continue to consider, making the diminution rules more generous and that they should leave more discretion to local people. We are also entitled to answers to the questions that the Government have not answered, such as that on the severe disability premium asked by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, which, clearly, the Minister did not understand. We also need information on some points that have not been made, such as the stringent time limits on accepting loans and the limits that apply to the self-employed who want to claim a refund of national insurance premiums paid in error because their income was below the threshold. The Minister said nothing about that. Furthermore, which parts of the regulations does the Minister agree will not benefit claimants?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.36 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Widdecombe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not castigate the Opposition for looking at detail. Indeed, had the hon. Member for Preston (Mrs Wise) heard the beginning of my answer to the debate
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
she would know that I congratulated the Opposition on their attention to detail, as the hon. Lady will see if she reads 	<i>Hansard.</i> When I said that the new regulations were overwhelmingly beneficial, I meant that they were not merely technical or consequential but that most involved specific improvements for people who need benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady is wrong to say that under the new system, if her constituent were refused benefit because she had gone to a warmer climate, she would have no redress, because there is a right of appeal. I do not want the Committee to go away with the impression that the new regulations impose a once-and-for-all decision and that it cannot be rescinded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise to the hon. Member for Ladywood, who asked me a specific question about calculating maintenance that I did not answer. The hon. Lady generously has informed me that I s hould write to her, but she may prefer to have the answer now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new regulations ensure that changes to the potential amount of maintenance to be recovered for families with children on income support are reflected when converting lump-sum payments to weekly amounts. The change means that the amount of the caring parent's personal allowance and any carer premium paid because of the child are added to the weekly amount. That shortens the period that the lump-sum payment is expected to cover. As it shortens the term of the payment, further maintenance becomes due sooner. If the hon Lady wishes to pursue any other aspects of that, I shall write to her. I shall also look carefully at the report of this debate and if any points have been raised that I have not covered I shall deal with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not accept the invitation of the hon. Member for Preston to open, yet again, the argument on notional capital. Unless a decision is taken that deprivation of capital was deliberate, there will be no change in the situation as the rules now being applied already existed under supplementary benefit.
