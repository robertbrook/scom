	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed</i> [	<i>28 February</i>]: No. 9, in page 3, line 29, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(11) SNH shall be notified of all forestry planting and shall advise the Secretary of State on such matters.".—[	<i>Mr. Macdonald.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are considering the following: New clause 4—Provision of advice in relation to forestry—
	<br><blockquote><p>" .—(1) SNH shall advise the Forestry Commissioners upon the location and design of forestry and its effects on the natural heritage of Scotland.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(2) Where, following advice from SNH, the Forestry Commissioners intend to approve an application for grant aid for forestry planting which, in the opinion of SNH, will be likely to lead to damage to the natural heritage of Scotland, SNH may request, and the Forestry Commissioners shall comply with such requests, that the application is referred to the Secretary of State for decision, and SNH may make such representations as it considers desirable to the Secretary of State.".</p></blockquote>
New clause 11—Forestry licences—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1) All new forestry planting schemes over a size to be specified by the Secretary of State shall have to be licenced.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(2) SNH shall issue such licences as it shall approve after consultation with the forestry commissioners and relevant local authorities.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Calum Macdonald 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Western Isles)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we adjourned last week, I was expressing my disappointment at the Minister's response. It seems a harmless enough proposal that all forestry planting over a certain size should be authorised with a planting licence. That should not involve too much bureaucracy. Not many planting proposals fall outwith the normal grant scheme, so it should be fairly cheap for Scottish Natural Heritage to administer. On the other hand, if a lot of planting proposals fell inside the grant scheme, there may be a little more bureaucracy, but the case for such a planting licence scheme would be all the stronger. On that basis, I feel that the Committee should divide on the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before I call the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro), I welcome
	<span class='label label-info column'>154</span>
him back to the Committee. I am glad that he has recovered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin. I am deeply sorry to have missed four sittings, but I am intensely interested in the Bill and have read the reports of the Committee's proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this debate on forestry, the Committee has overlooked the importance of the regional advisory committees, which, as everyone knows, adjudicate or give advice on disputes about whether to approve grants. Those important bridging committees should have greater influence in future. The regional advisory committees have been criticised for not having sufficient number of environmentalists as members. They have nine members, predominantly foresters. I hope to introduce a simple one-clause Bill to increase that number to 12, adding three environmentalists who could put forward an alternative view. That will help provide a fairer view on the question whether grants for planting should be awarded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nowadays it is possible, but unlikely, that people would plant without a grant. That is another aspect that should be taken into account, because the regional advisory committees have been an important buffer. If membership can be extened to include people from the environmental world, the regional advisory committees will be a more important asset.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro) is to be welcomed back. I strongly support his point about the regional advisory committees, but I do not believe that they are packed with forestry people. None the less, I accept that a much better balance of interests is needed. I support the increase in membership from nine to 12, with the three extra places going to environmentalists, but that will require primary legislation. I hope that my hon. Friend introduces a private Member's Bill, it will be supported by both sides of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) said that there should be a public register of all planting applications. We shall consider such a proposal, especially if its usefulness and effectiveness can be proved. We shall also consider favourably proposals on local authority involvement in the circulation of such a register.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I associate myself with other hon. Members in welcoming back the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro). I wish that he had been in Committee for earlier debates. I notice that the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir Nicholas Fairbairn) is absent. If that is an exchange deal, I am sure that it is acceptable to all, except in the interests of public entertainment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome what the Minister has said. If a gazette, as I call it, or a register, as the Minister calls it, were widely available, it would be a major advance in democratic involvement as it would effectively allow communities to know about and check on forestry

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 50, in page 3, line 29, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(11) Scottish Natural Heritage shall advise the Secretary of State on shipping activities which they consider to be detrimental, or potentially detrimental, to Scotland's natural heritage and the environment.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment deals with shipping activities around the Scottish coast and their potential effect on environmental interests. In the spirit of the Minister's concession at the end of the previous debate, it is worth saying that the purpose of Committee debates is not only to have amendments accepted—we are realistic about that—but to promote constructive debate and to lay down markers for the issues in which Scottish Natural Heritage should be involved. In our debates on several specific subjects it has been to the new agency's advantage that the Minister, while not accepting our amendments, has clearly said that he would not only accept, but would welcome SNH's involvement in such issues. Shipping activities fall within that scope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is of long-standing concern, especially on the west coast—other hon. Members may have similar tales to tell from other parts of the Scottish coast—that the biggest ecological disaster that could befall our coastline would be an oil spillage as a result of an incident at sea. I shall refer mainly to one geographical area of Scotland and I shall speak briefly, because it is more appropriate for my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) to go into detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, the area of Scotland in which there is the most urgent fear and alarm about the possibility of an incident involving an oil tanker and resulting in a spillage is in the Minches—the relatively narrow strip of water between the north-west Scottish mainland and the outer isles. There are well recorded reasons for that fear. There have been incidents and near misses. Tankers have got lost and narrowly avoided going aground on the small islands off Harris. Those incidents are not hypothetical—they have happened in recent years. The immense increase in the passage of vessels between the Sullom Voe terminal and points south has exacerbated those anxieties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no political dimension to those concerns. They have been expressed by a wide range of people
	<span class='label label-info column'>156</span>
and parties. I pay tribute in particular to the work of Vice Admiral Sir Roderick Macdonald, who in recent years has campaigned constantly on the issue on Skye. My hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles has been extremely active. The Ardnamurchan councillor Michael Foxley has persistently drawn the problem to public attention. Many well-informed people have expressed concern that, unless shipping movements in those waters are regulated to a far greater degree, the chances of a major ecological incident are all too real. I do not underestimate the knowledge of the committee that is looking into the implications of that. Everyone knows that a major oil spillage in those waters would have catastrophic implications for the shoreline and the wildlife of the area. Prevention would avoid the need for cure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the list of those concerned my hon. Friend might include officials of the Department of Transport. I attended the nature conservation presentation on the marine environment that was held in Northumberland street about six months ago. When the topic of the Minches was raised, the Department of Transport officials who were present leapt to their feet and affirmed their concern. A great deal of money is involved. I add that to the important points that my hon. Friend is making.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I readily accept that that concern exists in the Department of Transport, and that strengthens my argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not pretend that it will be easy to solve the problem or that opposition comes from apathy or from one source only. The Department of Transport has issued guidelines and has recommended that loaded tankers should take the long route round the outer isles, but there is controversy over the extent to which that is observed. Clearly, going the long way round has economic implications for the owners of vessels. It would be dishonest of me not to point out also that the National Union of Marine, Aviation and Shipping Transport Officers has expressed considerable reservations about any statutory ban on tankers going through the Minch because weather conditions may make the alternative passage unsuitable. The issue is neither simple nor straightforward, and no one pretends that it is. Against those difficulties, however, must be laid the potential environmental cost if nothing is done, and I bring that to the Committee's attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment would allow SNH to be a player in that drama. It should have the right to make representations. Perhaps it should carry out surveys on the level of risk and the precautionary measures that should be taken. We wish to assert that there is a role for SNH on this issue, as in so many others, which would enhance the status of the agency. The amendment would give it a positive right to become involved, rather than take the Minister's line that there is nothing to prevent it from becoming involved. We should prefer the role to be described a little more forcefully and to say that SNH should be positively involved in such a big environmental issue.

	<span class='label label-info column'>157</span>
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall restrict my remarks and allow my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles to go into more detail. I do not claim that the Minches is the only area of potential conflict. Perhaps the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs Michie) has her own thoughts on this as the coastline of Argyll would be exceptionally vulnerable to a major incident as would the Argyll islands, which present their own navigational hazards. Similarly, in the north, the Pentland firth should be studied for potential hazards. The amendment is not directed exclusively at the Minches, but has a more general application. The Government could accept it in spirit, if not in the letter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our debate will be of value in raising the profile of the issue and in paying tribute to the people who have worked hard on the matter over the years. It should be recognised that it is an environmental matter that should concern the Government and one in which they must have a proactive interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to add to the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson). I, too, hope that SNH will take a positive interest in the matter. The marine environment has been neglected in the past by existing agencies, for whatever reason, and I hope that SNH will take a wide view of its responsibilities for the marine environment. That should include the potential impact of the sort of shipping to which my hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, North referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been in touch with various organisations on this matter because there has been much anxiety about heavily laden tanker traffic in the Minches and the repercussions that a disaster would have on the area. The organisations with which I have had discussions include the Western Isles council and Highland regional council which will shortly hold a seminar because of the seriousness of the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Naturally, the Scottish Salmon Growers Association has also expressed anxiety. That industry could be devastated in the event of an accident. It has taken it amiss that the Department of Transport has suggested in correspondence that it is the association's responsibility to protect itself against the possibility of such an accident. No private firm, and certainly no individual fish-farmer, could seriously be expected to guard against such an accident. Various environmental groups have expressed deep anxiety about the problem. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, Friends of the Earth, the Marine Conservation Society and the Scottish Wildlife Trust are all involved heavily in the shore-line area of the west coast which, as the Minister knows, is environmentally sensitive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notion of an alternative route to the Minches route was first suggested in the mid to late 1980s, when it was perceived that the Minches held potential dangers and a new route west of the Hebrides between the Hebrides and St. Kilda was mapped out. The November 1986 edition of 	<i>Seaways,</i> the journal of the Nautical Institute, stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"although the routes through the Minches … are well marked, the channels are restricted in width and bounded by dangers, and
	<span class='label label-info column'>158</span>
should a casualty occur this could result in a major pollution disaster."</p></blockquote>
The journal pointed out that
	<br><blockquote><p>"on average some three tankers"</p></blockquote>
a day passed through that narrow and perilous gap. In the mid-1980's, a new deep-water route west of the Hebrides between the Hebrides and St. Kilda was charted. That route is 6.5 miles wide and nowhere within it are the depths less than 34 m. It is undoubtedly a much safer route for tanker traffic to use, at least in reasonable and good weather.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw to the Minister's attention the experience of local councils during recent exercises in which they rehearsed their emergency provisions for such accidents. In a report published by the Western Isles council, the director of engineering services said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the event of a major oil pollution incident"—</p></blockquote>
of the sort that we fear in the Minches—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Council is heavily dependent upon equipment held and deployed by Central Government and, given difficulties of distance and access, considerable pollution may have occurred before such resources are fully mobilised. It is also considered that in certain instances the equipment and materials held in Government stockpiles would not be sufficient"—</p></blockquote>
even if they were to become quickly available—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to combat effectively a major spill in the waters around the Western Isles."</p></blockquote>
Similar anxiety has been expressed to me by the equivalent director for Highland regional council as a result of the exercise that it undertook. The council was worried that equipment was not available in sufficient quantities to cope with the sort of accident that could happen in the Minches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have responded in that they have designated the deep-water route as the preferred route for tanker traffic. They studied the extent to which that deep-water route was being utilised. In a reply to my question about oil tankers, the Minister for Shipping said that he did not consider that there was a need for further clarification of the regulations because
	<br><blockquote><p>"tankers appear to use the existing recommended routes."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 26 July 1990, Vol. 177, c.	<i>405.</i>]</p></blockquote>
That is contrary to the evidence produced by the Government's survey, in which they monitored 21 tankers passing through the area off the north-west of Scotland. Of those, only four used the deep-water route, and another four claimed that they were prevented from doing so by bad weather. Only eight tankers, therefore, complied with the Government's recommendations. Thirteen tankers, the majority, continued to use the Minch route in weather conditions in which they could have used the deep-water route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that this is a difficult issue. A simple order to use the deep-water route would not be possible, because of the need to use the Minches when the weather is not suitable for the deep-water route. Nevertheless, there is a continuing problem. It is clear that tankers are ignoring the Department of Transport's recommendations. I hope that, following the evidence of its survey, the Department will look again at the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Friends of the Earth has recommended to the Department of Transport that the Minches should
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0094">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>159</span>
be designated as an area to be avoided. I understand that that is a cogent and legitimate designation within international maritime law and has already been used around the British coastline and elsewhere. There can be a specification why such an area must be avoided. In this case it would be for environmental reasons—to minimise the possibility of a major environmental disaster. A strengthening of the regulations governing the use of the Minches in that way should be examined seriously by the Department of Transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Under-Secretary, who is responsible for environmental matters in Scotland, will take a personal interest in the issue and liaise with his colleagues at the Department of Transport. Given the evidence of the survey, a tougher set of regulations is necessary and long overdue. The proposal of Friends of the Earth that the Minches should be designated an area to be avoided should be taken seriously. That could be backed up, if necessary, by aerial surveillance. The Scottish Office Agriculture and Fisheries Department seems to find no shortage of planes and helicopters to survey the purported activities of poachers around the Scottish coastline. Surely it would be easy for them to organise aerial surveillance of the activities of tanker traffic that contravened the Government's guidelines. I hope that the Minister will give a positive reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Ray Michie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll and Bute)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment. The hon. Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) earlier spelt out the enormous and horrendous problems that would occur in the event of an oil spillage. It would be especially serious in my constituency of Argyll and Bute, which is said to have a coastline as long as that of France. It has about 500 islands, not all of them inhabited, and covers a large area. As suggestions for oil development off the west coast of Scotland have come and gone, so people have raised with me their fears about possible pollution and oil spillage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) said, Highland regional council hopes to hold a seminar. It has already been in contact with me and Argyll district council. I believe that we could have a worthwhile discussion about the problems that would arise if such an event were to occur. We want to prevent it from happening, so I support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting debate. I remember vividly that when the Exxon Valdez disaster occurred in Alaska, there was a private notice question on the Floor of the House a day or so later because of an oil spill from the Cormorant platform in the North sea. What was interesting about the question was which Minister should reply to it because the spill affected the Department of Transport, the Department of Energy and the Scottish Office. I ended up replying to it and, although there was no environmental damage to Scotland, there was a clear determination in the House of Commons that we should concentrate on prevention and do everything possible in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>160</span>
The hon. Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) has done more than lay down a marker and the supporting speech of the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) was well informed on the subject. I am glad to say that it is significant that SNH can advise Ministers on anything affecting natural heritage under clause 2(1)(a) and that that relates not only to the Scottish Office, but to Ministers at the Department of Transport.

The Government are fully aware of the concern expressed over the years and recently by Members of Parliament, local authorities, environmental groups, voluntary organisations and others calling for steps to be taken to reduce or eliminate tanker traffic in the Minch. Certainly, the Scottish Office shares the concern expressed about the sensitivity of the area and the enormous environmental and economic damage that might arise as a result of an accident involving a laden tanker. The hon. Member for Western Isles talked about a narrow, perilous gap and mentioned exercises to rehearse emergency provision to meet the possibility of an event which we all hope will not occur. Obviously, we are very much in the business of prevention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Committee will be aware, routing measures for shipping are the responsibility of my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Transport. The Scottish Office Agriculture and Fisheries Department has impressed on the Department of Transport the seriousness of this issue, the possible threat to the ecosystem of fishing and fish-farming interests and the concerns felt by the councils and Highland regional council. The Department of Transport has concluded that the best course is to continue to urge the use of the deep-water route to the west of the Outer Hebrides in appropriate conditions. That is done internationally through the International Maritime Organisation, at national level by contract with local oil companies, and locally by means of notices to mariners issued at Sullom Voe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will wish to bear it in mind that the Minch is designated an international strait, though it is in territorial waters. As such, it has attached to it rights of innocent passage which means that tankers cannot be banned from using it. The exercise of any mandatory restriction over passage through the Minch could have repercussions for the passage of British shipping through international straits in other parts of the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall draw the debate to the attention of Ministers at the Department of Transport so that they may study carefully what has been said. We shall ensure that the Department understands the worries expressed by the hon. Member for Western Isles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister and I shall not press the amendment because the Committee is not divided on what is desirable. However, I was disturbed by the penultimate passage of the Minister's speech when he took refuge in the legal difficulties of designating the Minch and of preventing tanker movements in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know the history of the matter, but I suspect that that designation was made when
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0095">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>161</span>
circumstances were vastly different in that there was not the heavy volume of tanker traffic described by my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald). If those circumstances have changed, there should be a review of that status, as would be the case anywhere else in the world if there was a relatively sudden increase in the number of tankers using a stretch of water.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for the Minister's comment about consultation with other Ministers. I hope that the seminar being organised by Highland regional council, at which, I presume, the Government will be represented, will become a target timetable for the Government to have something rather more helpful to say on the subject. I assume that they will want to offer slightly more positive proposals than those implied in what the Minister said today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Minister's assertion that it is well within the functions of SNH to provde observations on the matter. I am sure that the account of our proceedings is being carefully read by those who will administer SNH—if they are not doing so, I cannot imagine who else might be reading it. If that is the case, however, it is clear from the Minister's remarks that it would be within the rights of those people to take an interest in the subject. I hope that they do so and thereby contribute to the lobby that has kept the issue in high profile and raised public awareness about the extent of the threat that exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If SNH becomes involved that can only be for the general good of the environment of Scotland and the agency itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 55, in page 3, line 29, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(11) SNH shall prepare statements of policy for all national nature reserves and shall consult interested parties on their content and implementation.".</p></blockquote>
I hope that the amendment will receive a positive response from the Minister because it is reasonable and sensible. With hindsight, however, I would have made one change to the wording. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"SNH shall prepare statements of policy for all national nature reserves and shall consult interested parties on their content and implementation."</p></blockquote>
When I prepared the amendment, I was thinking of "statements of policy" that applied to each specific nature reserve and not of a general statement of policy covering all nature reserves. In that context, SNH should prepare an individual statement of management policy for each nature reserve and, in the process of doing so, it should consult widely to ensure the greatest possible input. When consultation is completed and SNH has drawn its conclusions, that statement should be made public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may seem extraordinary that our nature reserves lack such public statements of policy but that is the case under the Nature Conservancy Council's current management of many of them. I should have thought that if such statements were available for each nature reserve, they would provide a rational, predictable framework within which SNH could operate. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>162</span>
future decisions of all the other interests that have a locus in each nature reserve, such as landowners, could be guided by those public statements. They would also allow interested authorities and outside environmental bodies a framework within which to respond to proposals or actions that affect nature reserves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A public statement of policy would also aid public accountability of SNH in its management of those nature reserves. We could see whether SNH was pursuing a wide mandate, which we hope will follow from the legislation, or whether it restricted itself to the pure biological, scientific focus of the old NCC. If there was a publicly stated policy for the nature reserves, we could see which of those two courses was being pursued by SNH. That would also aid public accountability of expenditure undertaken by SNH in its management of nature reserves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall illustrate the need for such a public statement of policy for each nature reserve by examining in detail the history of the Cairngorm estates, which has been under NCC management for many years and which forms Britain's foremost nature reserve. Indeed, the Government propose that it should be a world heritage site. That nature reserve was established in 1954 and then covered about 34,000 acres. The NCC set up the Cairngorm consultative panel that was presided over by Professor Matthews of Aberdeen university. It included representatives from local authorities, mountaineering and other outdoor interests who expressed an interest in the management of the reserve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The panel was intended to meet regularly to provide an input for all the varied interests and to provide a public framework to discuss the management policy for the new nature reserve. However, the panel met only once on 28 June 1954—a mere 10 days before the formal declaration of the reserve. It never met again and no explanation was given. Nevertheless, without the help of the panel, a management plan was eventually produced by the NCC in 1958. It provided a framework within which nature reserve agreements were negotiated with individual owners of the three main estates that were the heart of the nature reserve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That plan was updated in the 1960s, by which time the nature reserve covered about 70,000 acres and that was the last publicly available document about the management of that nature reserve. The document gave a comprehensive account of the reasons for the reserve establishment, the research work that was being undertaken, the management objectives in its oversight of the reserve and the policies being pursued to achieve those objectives. An annex to the 1960s plan contained details of the individual management agreements that were drawn up with each estate, but that annex was kept confidential. Nevertheless, the framework plan was publicly available and it guided outside bodies and local authorities on the public debates that took place on the future management of the reserve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By the 1970s, the 1960s plan was outdated, just as the 1958 plan became out of date, so new policies for the reserve were introduced. Those were needed to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0096">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>163</span>
reflect the growing public interest in the reserve, partly because of the skiing developments of Aviemore and the Cairngorms in the 1960s, and because of the general increase in leisure and outdoor activities in that period. Equally important was the growing realisation that new approaches were being made in the management of reserve habitats. For example, overgrazing by red deer was widely perceived as preventing the regeneration of the native woodland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1974, 1975 and 1976, the NCC convened three special meetings, each of which was attended by local community interests, user groups and landowning interests to discuss the problems facing the reserve and to exchange views on potential solutions and the future management of the reserve. Following those meetings, the NCC drafted proposed policies to cover the period 1976–1980. The draft policy statement, entitled "Document for consultation in advance of planning" was sent to a wide range of interest groups in 1976. Amazingly, two days after the distribution of that draft policy statement, the NCC's regional officer wrote to all the recipients asking for the document to be immediately returned to the NCC. The suspicion at the time was that landowning interests in the reserve had objected to the distribution of the draft policy statement. That document has never reappeared and neither has any other policy statement about what the NCC believes should be happening in what is supposed to be Britain's most important nature conservation area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the failure of that round of consultation and the lapse of the last publicly available management plan, most of the nature reserve agreements conducted with individual landowners have come up for renewal. With the passage of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, opportunities have arisen for landowners to gain financial compensation for managing their land in ways that benefit nature conservation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NCC has been obliged to carry out negotiations and to realise individual agreements without help from policy guidelines governing the management of the reserve and without public input into that process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From 1976 onwards, the NCC, in response to inquiries from voluntary conservation organisations, has regularly confirmed that it is working on the production of a statement of policies for public consultation. Even as recently as September last year, the NCC suggested that such a statement was expected to be publicly available by the end of 1990, but, predictably, no such statement has appeared. During that 15-year period from 1976 to date, the NCC, when asked to explain why a statement of policy is not circulated, has almost always answered that further discussions are needed with landowners who own the estates within the nature reserve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the most detailed examination of the Cairngorms by a Committee of this House took place in 1984, when the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs undertook an investigation into the workings of the Highlands and Islands Development Board.
	<span class='label label-info column'>164</span>
During that investigation, the Committee visited the northern slopes of the Cairngorms, taking evidence from a wide range of interests. Inevitably, the management of the Cairngorms as a whole came under scrutiny. In its report, published in 1985, the Select Committee considered the question of management planning for reserves, such as the Cairngorm nature reserve. Paragraph 102 of the report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The third proposal from the North East Mountain Trust, that there should be a management plan for the whole of the Cairngorm Estate and those areas which abut it (the National Nature Reserve and the Glenmore Forest Park) is one that deserves sympathetic hearing."</p></blockquote>
The case then for a management plan for the Cairngorm area was strong. It is interesting to note that one member of that Select Committee, who agreed with its unanimous recommendations, was the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), now Minister of State. Yet, we are still waiting for that management plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of the Cairngorms nature reserve is in private ownership. If the past 20 years is anything to go by, there is little prospect of the NCC initiating a public discussion of its management policies. Meanwhile, the quality of the reserve—the centrepiece of a proposed world heritage site, which the Government endorse—continues to degenerate. A key requirement in arresting that process is the production of public statements on management policy. The same should apply to all nature reserves in Scotland. Such statements should be based on the widest possible consultation with environmental interests, landowners and local authorities, and should be made publicly available. A requirement that the new agency should formulate such management policies and make those policies publicly available is surely reasonable and sensible. It can only enhance the public accountability of the management of Scotland's natural heritage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make a few remarks. I realise that the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) tabled the amendment so that the Committee could have a short debate on points of interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been a nature conservancy councillor since 1982—I do not know what the NCC was doing in the 1970s—and I cannot think of SNH without realising that the management of the national nature reserves will be one of its prime tasks. I am sure that the Minister will say that it is unnecessary to highlight that in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has never been a meeting of the Nature Conservancy Council when national nature reserves have not been discussed. If the hon. Gentleman reads the last report of the NCC dealing with nature reserves, he will realise that there has been a running review of them. A major policy document has now been published, but with so many NCC documents, I could not carry them all upstairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are 68 national reserves in Scotland, under different forms of ownership and management and they are an important part of our heritage. The NCC has put an enormous amount of work into preparing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0097">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>165</span>
management plans for the national nature reserves. Its latest document sets it all out in detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a useful debate and I enjoyed the contributions of the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) and of my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising the subject of the development and implementation of policy for national nature reserves. They are truly the jewels in the nature conservation crown and represent sites of at least national and sometimes international significance for the protection of habitats and the conservation of earth-science features. It is the NCC's policy to prepare management plans for national nature reserves and I expect Scottish Natural Heritage to carry that on. It is a substantial task as there are 68 reserves in Scotland, covering 112,000 hectares. The NCC, I believe correctly, has concentrated in the first instance on developing management plans for the 15 sites that they own, which cover about 30 per cent of the total national nature reserve area in Scotland. A statutory duty, as suggested by the hon. Gentleman, would neither hasten the management planning process nor make it more effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the hon. Member for Western Isles understands the nature reserve agreement mechanism under which the NCC and the owners and occupiers can come to an agreed understanding of the future management of national nature reserves. Such an arrangement is now in operation for 27 reserves as well as for a further 19 reserves that have a mixture of ownership, leasing and agreement arrangements. Clearly, the NCC could not have reached such agreements without full consultation with interested parties both on the policy and management within the area and the way that they should be brought into practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, the amendment is not necessary. It would not improve the effectiveness or efficiency of the SNH management of both owned and non-owned national nature reserves. In the light of those points I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press the amendment. The preparation of policy statements is a sizeable task. On non-owned or leased sites, it will be necessary for the NCC—as it will be for SNH—to come to an agreement with the landowner on reserve management policy and how it should be implemented. My hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries is right to point out the information that has been made public in that connection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reassure the hon. Member for Western Isles that many reserves have such statements, but see no need for a statutory duty. Brochures exist for most reserves and are available to the public from visitor centres in or near national nature reserves. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the management agreements can be obtained from the Register of Sasines, which is a public register. The hon. Gentleman particularly asked about the Cairngorms. A working party will cover the matters that the hon. Gentleman raised. It will develop aims and objectives and identify how
	<span class='label label-info column'>166</span>
they can be implemented. The working party will have wide representation and we hope to announce the membership before long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although a statutory amendment of that nature is premature, we are willing to consider further changes in national nature reserves following the present NCC review. I emphasise that we expect the Nature Conservancy Council for Scotland and SNH to carry that review forward. That will provide the framework sought by the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I would expect the NCCS and Scottish Natural Heritage to consult on the future management of national nature reserves. In key areas, such as the Cairngorms, we have proposed a wide consultative process through Magnus Magnusson's working party, which we believe will be highly successful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To some extent, the amendment is intended to flag up an issue, which I hope that those entrusted with looking after the nature reserves will be able to carry forward when they take up their duties and responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not press the amendment to a Division now if the Minister can assure me that a policy document for each nature reserve will be made publicly available, so that members of the public can easily obtain copies of it from SNH's various regional offices. I am not talking about statements that cover the conduct of all nature reserves in general. I want the documents to be detailed and to relate to each nature reserve individually. That will provide a proper guide for those interested in the conservation of a specific nature reserve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a document would provide the opportunity for public consultation on the formulation of policies for individual nature reserves and, thus, provide a rational basis on which SNH can determine matters. I am not negating or neglecting the interests of landowners. It would be useful, too, for them to have access to a policy statement, so that they could organise the planning of their estates in the years to come. Such a document would also enable prospective purchasers of estates to know in advance their future management obligations. Landowners and prospective land purchasers would appreciate that information. The amendment would not denigrate the interests of landowners. Surely they would welcome the security and perspective that would be afforded to them by such a proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister can assure me that policy statements will be made publicly available for each nature reserve, I shall happily withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To make information publicly available will certainly be recommended practice. However, before going further, we wish to await the outcome of the NCC review.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) will appreciate that we have already examined the issue in the consultation paper, "Scotland's Natural Heritage: The Way Ahead", at page 20, paragraph 13. In the light of responses to the consultation paper, we decided that, on balance, it would be best not to amend the present arrangements. SNH will not be best equipped to reach a view on the extent of damage to agriculture or fisheries interests, and to transfer responsibility without amending the criterion on which licences are issued, would place it in an individous position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can assure the Committee that the Scottish Office Agriculture and Fisheries Department presently liaises closely with the NCC, and in future will liaise with SNH where licences to shoot protected species are sought. I am aware that the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs Mitchie) has tabled a new clause on the subject, which we shall discuss later. Joint inspections are carried out by officials of the Scottish Office Agriculture and Fisheries Department and the NCC to assess the extent of damage and the success of scaring methods which have been tried.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department has experienced and expert agricultural staff, well versed in assessing damage and the viability of scaring methods. Similarly, SNH will inherit experienced and expert staff in assessing population levels and the dynamics of endangered species. As noted in the consultation paper, the Scottish Office believes that the critical issue is to establish viable population levels of protected species, particularly in areas where conflict between agriculture and protection occurs. That may involve the preparation of management plans in future and we look forward to obtaining views and advice from the NCC on the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tabled the amendment in the hope of receiving an explanation from the Minister of what is meant by "development project or scheme" in clause 5(1), and to provide an opportunity to examine a particular project or scheme. I agree that the conservation of our marine environment is extremely important. I hope to show why I need reassurance that a project or scheme will be thoroughly thought out, with local consultation at all stages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that no one is trying to remove clause 3(d) from the Bill, as it is important. It states that SNH must take into consideration the interests of local communities. Loch Sween is a sheltered sea loch lying 30 miles south of Oban in mid-Argyll. It has a rich abundance of marine inhabitants and the NCC wants it to be designated a marine nature reserve. It would be the first in Scotland and only the third in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NCC discussion document runs to many pages and covers management proposals and mariculture. However, there is little mention of the population of 300-plus living in Tayvallich, Achnamara and round the shores. The NCC wants restrictions on static gear fishing and no renewal of salmon fishing activities. It is interesting that the cover of the document omits the centres of population that I mentioned, including the Castle Sween caravan park. I wonder whether that is to encourage people not familiar with the area to believe that it is a natural wilderness where hardly anyone would be affected if a marine nature reserve was created. I do not know how many members of the Committee have seen the document, but it gives no sign of a population round the loch side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local community resents the byelaws included in the consultation document. The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I thought that byelaws were made by the Secretary of State, not by a body such as the NCC. They may have been included in the document to give an idea of what the Secretary of State may do and I draw two of them to the attention of the Committee. One says that no object must be disturbed, damaged or destroyed. I was asked by a teacher at a local school if that meant that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0099">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>169</span>
children going along the shore could not overturn a rock or a stone to see little creepy-crawly things underneath, which we probably all did as youngsters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another byelaw would not permit to be brought into the reserve any living creature or bird, or the egg of any creature or bird, or any plant or seed, in such circumstances that such a creature or bird may reproduce, such a plant may propagate, such an egg may hatch or such a seed may germinate. That is a sweeping byelaw, which would bring nature to a halt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A balance must be achieved between the legitimate needs and interests of nature and conservationists, and those of local people and visitors to loch Sween. From the evidence available and the views of the local community, there seem to be few arguments in favour of establishing another layer of bureaucracy in the form of a marine nature reserve. We must question the arguments for doing that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NCC's discussion document is full of warnings of potential damage to the loch, but there is little mention of actual damage that would have to be rectified. The only actual damage mentioned is from mobile fishing gear. The document states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The majority of habitats and communities within the Loch have retained a high degree of naturalness",</p></blockquote>
and that the attributes of the loch do not make extra protection necessary because
	<br><blockquote><p>"Few rare species have been recorded in Loch Sween".</p></blockquote>
Any damage that has occurred or is likely to occur would be localised and would be better dealt with by means other than an all-encompassing marine nature reserve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Far from being a threat to the local environment, the local residents are extremely aware of the environment and act as its greatest guardians. The local community is heavily dependent on the loch for its livelihood and continued existence through fish-farming, shellfish harvesting, trawling, leisure activities and tourism. The proposed marine nature reserve and its various attached restrictions would undoubtedly limit such activities, hence the number of people who could feasibly continue to live and work in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local community is the greatest source of knowledge on the loch. Any measures that would reduce its number or alienate it from its care for the loch would be a disservice to the legitimate goals of protecting the loch and the surrounding area and, indeed, or promoting enjoyment and understanding of the environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have received many hundreds of letters from local people, visitors and out-and-out conservationists, all of whom object to the proposed marine nature reserve. The Secretary of State has had a similar number of objectors' letters. In one letter to the NCC the writer says of its consultation document:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Your document admits that the loch has 'a high degree of naturalness in habitats and communities; no unique and few rare species; is fragile with a high diversity of habitat types' all of which exist together because of the care of the environment taken by this and previous generations of users acting in a spirit of mutual tolerance and co-operation. The loch is as vulnerable as any other to over fishing and over use but where is your evidence that this
	<span class='label label-info column'>170</span>
is going to happen—and where is the evidence that the creation of an MNR is essential to control it? Is this another Rhum in the making—or nearer home, is it another Taynish?"</p></blockquote>
That is an area taken over by the NCC, which not many people are encouraged to visit. We must recognise that it has taken eight years of time, effort and taxpayers' money to develop the NCC's proposals. Perhaps that time and money could have been saved if at an earlier stage the matter had been referred to the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Norfolk, North-West (Mr. Bellingham) should not conduct a conversation while an hon. Member is addressing the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is not right to dismiss the feelings of the people around loch Sween. I cannot impress too firmly on the Committee and the Secretary of State how opposed they are to the proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of bodies are also against setting up the marine nature reserve, such as the loch Sween joint action committee, the Tayvallich harbour committee, the Tayvallich sailing club, Argyll and Bute district council, the West Highland anchorage and marine association and the caravan owners association. I do not know who is in favour of the reserve apart from the NCC—perhaps the Minister knows.

Magnus Magnusson has spoken to the Minister about the matter and I was grateful for his assurance that, if the NCC or SNH fails to take the local people with them, the plans will be withdrawn. For a man who understands the sensitivities of the area, that would be a wise move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to follow the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs Michie) who referred to a beautiful loch that I know well from sailing on it. When I was the Minister with responsibility for education in Scotland, I recall keeping open the school there when others wanted to shut it.

It is often unwise to introduce legislation hastily, and it is worth putting on record the history of marine nature reserves. In 1980, I was the Minister responsible for taking the Wildlife and Countryside Bill through the House of Commons. When we began considering the Bill, it did not contain a marine nature reserve clause, however, in another place, against all Government advice, a clause that introduced such reserves was inserted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Bill came back to the House for consideration, I removed that clause. I did so under great pressure because of the feelings of Opposition Members. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) is not in Committee at present as he was much involved in those proceedings. With the greatest reluctance, because we were aware of what the outcome would be we inserted into the Bill a provision that introduced marine

	<span class='label label-info column'>171</span>
nature reserves—now clause 36 in the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the enormous amount of work that the NCC undertook, with scarce resources, in an effort to meet the provisions of the 1981 Act, the Isle of Lundy off the English coast and Skomer in Wales are the only existing marine nature reserves. When England and Wales were working on what sites should be designated as such reserves, it was understandable that the Scots considered that they should have them too. That is why, after much thought, it was decided that loch Sween was the premier site in Scotland to be so designated and, in 1986, that procedure began.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad—as is the hon. Lady the Member for Argyll and Bute—that such designation has not been achieved because it is unnecessary and would not enhance what is already a beautiful area. As I said on Second Reading, if there is anything detrimental to loch Sween, it is the caravan site on the shore—otherwise, it is a most lovely place to be, especially on a sunny summer day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulties involved in introducing byelaws that must be instigated by the local authority and confirmed by the Secretary of State have shown that it is almost impossible to reach agreement on them. No one wanted to proceed with a marine nature reserve without agreement. Many different organisations—the hon. Lady referred to some of them—that are interested in sailing, fishing, the scenery and recreational activities have the right to be consulted. Local people who live around the shore of loch Sween also have the right to have their views taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NCC was reluctant—and rightly so—to proceed with the designation of loch Sween as a marine nature reserve unless it could obtain agreement. That has never been achieved, and it is not likely that agreement with organisations in the area will ever be reached. I am glad that the future chairman of SNH, Magnus Magnusson, does not wish to proceed unless he obtains general agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local people have the right to put up a good case against the wishes of the NCC in its attempt to meet the Wildlife and Countryside Act which, as I said earlier, was introduced in a hurry—parts of it especially at the request of Opposition Members. I simply wanted to show that that legislation is so drafted that it is almost impossible to establish a marine nature reserve without agreement. That is why only two have been designated in 10 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs Michie). This is the "loch Sween" amendment, with which I am familiar from the Argyllshire press and the statements and speeches of the hon. Lady. I congratulate her on the tenacity with which she has pursued the matter and represented the interests of her constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final part of the hon. Lady's speech was the most important as she said that there seems to be a new willingness on the part of SNH to re-examine the designation of loch Sween. That suggests a watershed. The correspondence I read in the Argyllshire press
	<span class='label label-info column'>172</span>
developed into a classic slanging match and strong language was used. I have no grounds to suggest that that is the fault of the NCC. The mild way in which the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro) approached the issue suggests that it may well not be the NCC's fault. However, there is no doubt that attitudes have become polarised about loch Sween, and that may have been unnecessary. It may be mixing metaphors to speak about green wellies and tackety boots, but such an approach seems to have been perceived, if not intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party supports marine nature reserves in principle. We should like controls in many marine areas to be tightened. However, the prerequisite for that is an emphasis on consultation and co-operation. A strong body of opinion may oppose proposals for marine nature reserves because they are misunderstood, or because the damaging implications have been exaggerated. People may rightly perceive, however, that their livelihoods will be unreasonably interfered with. That is best dealt with through conciliation and consensus rather than by legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Loch Sween is the main site to be considered as a marine nature reserve, but consideration has also been given to so designating the sound of Raasay. I am not sure how a marine nature reserve can be combined with a torpedo-testing range, but there has been talk of designating the waters round the island of Scalpay—Scalpay, Skye, not Scalpay, Harris—as a marine nature reserve. Alarm bells would ring with local fishermen were that to happen. That decision should not be taken from on high, but made as a result of negotiation, consultation, conciliation and other virtuous practices that we hope will characterise the work of SNH.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was particularly interested to listen to the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro), because he introduced the original Wildlife and Countryside Act 1987. He made it clear that, contrary to his advice, the relevant clause was inserted in another place, and went through with great reluctance on his part. In the intervening years, only two marine nature reserves have come to fruition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the "loch Sween" amendment, as it highlights the position of loch Sween. I agree with the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs Michie), who said that there must be a balance between nature conservation and the interests of local people. I appreciate that the local community relies heavily on the loch for fish-farming, tourism and other pursuits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 37 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 empowers the NCC to make byelaws for the protection of marine nature reserves with the consent of the Secretary of State. However, the byelaws do not take effect until confirmed by the Secretary of State, who can refuse to do so under section 37(1) of the 1981 Act. He can, however, confirm with modifications, if appropriate. The Secretary of State also has power to direct the NCC to revoke or amend byelaws after it has consulted him. I well understand the hon. Lady's desire to discuss the subject, but before dealing with the matter, I should make it clear
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0101">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>173</span>
why we resist the amendment to the powers set out in clause 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause gives SNH the ability to set up and operate development projects or schemes designed to achieve "the conservation or enhancement" of the natural heritage of Scotland, and to foster the understanding and enjoyment of it. Given the wording of subsection (1), it is unnecessary to specify the types of project or scheme that the new power might cover. The schemes must involve new or developed methods, concepts or techniques and must serve to demonstrate the appropriateness of the project or scheme to the area concerned or to other areas with similar problems. The schemes are, therefore, for demonstration and experimental purposes only. Consequently, the provisions of the clause are not apt for nature conservation designations such as those proposed in the amendment, nor does the clause contain powers to enable SNH to put such designations into effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Statutory powers to establish marine nature reserves are set out in sections 36 and 37 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. We therefore see no need for a further statutory designation power for the same purposes, as such duplication would simply cause confusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise that marine nature reserves are difficult to put in place—only two have been established. We are already committed to reviewing marine nature conservation legislation, and it would be inappropriate to make any statutory changes in at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With respect to loch Sween and the proposals for a marine nature reserve, I recognise that there is substantial opposition from the hon. Lady's constituency and from others with an interest in the area. It must be remembered, however, that the NCC has put out its proposals for consultation. Once that process is complete, it will be for the NCC to determine how to take the matter forward. It is not for me to prejudge or determine how the NCC should respond to the consultation process. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will become involved only if the NCC decides to bring forward formal proposals for the designation of a marine nature reserve in loch Sween under the 1981 Act, as it is his responsibility to designate such a reserve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I trust that, in the light of those arguments, the hon. Lady will withdraw her amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Ray Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister, especially for his explanation of byelaws, which will be of considerable interest to my constituents. I welcome the support that we have in Committee for the concept that local consultation is important. With the co-operation of local people, we can help to conserve many interesting areas in Scotland. I hope that the NCC will carefully read the report of the debate. I am sure that it is clear what we all feel about marine nature reserves and, in particular, loch Sween. In view of the Minister's remarks, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>174</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 39, in page 4, leave out lines 1 to 8.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take amendment No. 20, in page 4, line 1, leave out subsections (4) and (5).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As members of the Committee are aware, subsections (4) and (5) were inserted in clause 5 in another place, despite Government assurances that they were unnecessary. It is a replica of the situation that my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries encountered 10 years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The movers of the amendment in another place thought that it was important to provide for a right of appeal against development projects or schemes proposed by SNH, because clause 5 had been interpreted as allowing SNH to impose such schemes or projects on unwilling landowners. I should like to take the opportunity to explain, both to the Committee and to those who were worried about the matter, how clause 5 will operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, clause 5 does not allow SNH to set up and run any kind of project simply because it would be appropriate to its general aims and purposes. The clause is restricted to projects that will demonstrate innovative approaches to natural heritage issues. While clause 5(3) empowers SNH to implement its proposals, this does not mean that it can impose those proposals on unwilling landowners. When SNH does not own the land concerned, it must obtain the landowner's consent. If that is not forthcoming, SNH's only alternative is to acquire the land. That would involve compulsory purchase, which needs the approval of the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given those safeguards of the landowner's position, no right of appeal is needed. SNH has no powers other than those expressly conferred on it by statute. Clause 5 is therefore limited in scope, and cannot be read on its own, as some have argued. There is no argument between us and the Opposition about the subsections being removed and I commend the amendment to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to be the first to congratulate the Minister on his willingness to stand up to the vested interests and powers of the landowners. I hope that he is not drummed out of the Scottish Landowners Federation as a result. We welcome the removal of the Lords amendments.

	<span class='label label-info column'>175</span>
that clause 5(3) does not mean that the proposals will be imposed on unwilling landowners. SNH must obtain the landowner's consent, which is an important principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 30, in page 4, line 11, leave out—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(a) acquire land compulsorily.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 31, in page 4, line 43, leave out subsection (9).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remember in this very Room in 1968 we debated the Highland and Islands Development Bill, which was introduced by the then Labour Government, and whether compulsory purchase should be available. The Government held the majority, as usual in Committees, so they acquired the right to purchase land compulsorily, but it is seldom, if ever, that that power has been used. Governments have often been criticised for not doing so, but it is not a power that has been wielded with any great enthusiasm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was a little surprised that the Bill proposes that SNH should have the power to purchase land compulsorily, and the subsequent amendment follows on from that. I wish to press my hon. Friend the Minister to explain why that provision was included in the Bill. I am a little rusty on the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, but I do not think that the NCC has the right to purchase land compulsorily, nor has the Countryside Commission, so why are those two bodies in a joint position to be given that unique power? The right to purchase land compulsorily is a powerful weapon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have all had moments of anxiety about statutory undertakings' rights to compulsory purchase to run pylons, gas pipelines, or other utility functions often backed up by decisions taken by the district valuer. He is a unique character in Scotland who seems to be answerable to no one. It is difficult to negotiate with a district valuer because he takes the ultimate decision. Many people believe that a compulsory right to purchase, with the valuation being done by the district valuer, should be given to an authority or quango with the greatest care and only after examination of whether such a power is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why does my hon. Friend the Minister believe that that power is essential to SNH, bearing in mind the controversial results of such a power? Whenever possible, we should proceed with harmony and agreement. That is why the NCC has management agreements and purchases land with the greatest reluctance and only if it cannot come to an alternative financial agreement with the landowner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Land is expensive and I do not believe that SNH should try to build up a capital portfolio by compulsory purchase. My hon. Friend will have to give me some good reasons why the provision has been included. I hope that he can give some examples
	<span class='label label-info column'>176</span>
of what he has in mind. Will SNH buy Fordell castle, for example? I am sure that my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir Nicholas Fairbairn) would be interested to know, if he were here. I could give many examples, but I do not wish to delay our proceedings. The power should be given only with the greatest care and I want to know why my hon. Friend the Minister thinks that it is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro) on raising the matter at a timely moment, given that there is now a major controversy over the future of the Mar Lodge estate on Deeside. The estate covers about 77,000 acres a few miles from Balmoral, and is owned by someone called John Kluge, an American billionaire, who is now divorcing his wife. As a consequence of that domestic problem, that enormous estate is expected to come on to the market in the early summer. That is a fine example of why the powers provided by the Bill are required. I understand that approaches have already been made to the Minister and the Scottish Office about the future of the estate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Professor Aubrey Manning, the chairman of the Scottish Wildlife Trust is reported in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> of 23 February as having
	<br><blockquote><p>"called upon the environment minister, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, to buy the estate 'on behalf of the people of Scotland'".</p></blockquote>
The article continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A spokesman for the Scottish Office said: 'We are aware that the estate may be coming up for sale and we are aware of the interest of several conservation groups, but it is too early to make any comment.'"</p></blockquote>
I wonder whether the Minister can now comment because, since then, a number of bodies have expressed anxiety about the future of the estate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dave Morris of the Ramblers Association and Dermat Grigson of Scottish Rural Forum have written to 	<i>The Scotsman</i> about the issue. More important from the Minister's point of view, Sir John Lister-Kaye, the new chairman of the Nature Conservancy Council's north-west regional board, has expressed concern about the future of the estate. An article that appeared on 8 February in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> quotes him as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is probably a consensus among conservationists that Mar Lodge represents in one property the greatest single chance for a co-operative major conservation initiative. The possibility of a sale in the near future demonstrates that in some instances private ownership is a regularly occurring threat to precious habitats of this sort, and recognising the very high capital value of such an estate one of the options which should now be considered very carefully is a co-operative venture between two or three principal nature conservation agencies."</p></blockquote>
Given such a body of opinion in the submissions to the Scottish Office, can the Minister tell us how far his considerations have progressed on the future of that precious estate? I understand that its asking price is £13 million or £14 million, which is less than the cost of a Tornado. When one thinks of what could be secured for future generations if the Government were to seize the opportunity, one realises that they could prove their commitment to Scotland's national heritage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0103">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>177</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro). We expect our hon. Friend the Minister to give us sound, logical reasons why the new body required statutory powers. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries, said, those of us with rural constituencies can think of many cases when such powers given to statutory bodies drew attention to electricity lines, gas pipelines and so on. Such matters affect my constituency as the gas pipelines from the north come through it and it has vast generating capacity which requires a lot of pylons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we give statutory bodies the power to make compulsory purchases it will lead to problems such as have occurred in the past. The argument about Mar Lodge has no real relevance to compulsory purchase in the circumstances that we are discussing. I do not know whether there would be problems if a body set out by Parliament had the necessary funds—I do not know whether it will have them—to acquire estates on that scale. However, the Government already have adequate holdings of land throughout Scotland and I would be most reluctant to have them extended. I believe that there are other ways in which to ensure that Mar Lodge will be run in a manner that satisfies conservationists while providing a living for those who depend on it for their jobs. I hope that the Bill contains such means.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Ray Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro) referred to the Highlands and Islands Development Board and compulsory purchase powers. I recall that it tried to use them but found it impossible to do so. I believe that it was explained at the time that its powers were neither better nor greater than those given to a local authority to purchase land needed to enlarge a road, for example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was a great miss on the part of the HIDB and some hon. Members will recall my repeated efforts last year to try to get compulsory purchase powers for it included in the Enterprise and New Towns (Scotland) Bill. I remember being ridiculed at the time by the present Secretary of State for Scotland for daring to suggest such powers being given in a free-market economy, so I am surprised to see such a proposal included in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If SNH is to have such powers, will the Minister explain what they mean? Will it be able to buy a whole estate? Will it be able to buy a farm and destock it so that shepherds and stockmen depart and the land is used only as a sanctuary for birds or for other purposes? I want to hear the Minister's explanation before I make up my mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I still find it difficult to accept that there is a need to create new bodies and quangos for the conservation of nature when there is no body that can do everything to ensure that people stay in the countryside and are allowed to live and work there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot support the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro), but I do not want to say too much against it as that might provoke a counter reaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>178</span>
The issue of Mar Lodge has been raised. It puts land ownership into focus. Mar Lodge, with its glorious history, was bought by an old man and his good lady, the American porn queen. It seems that it is open to that lady to own tens of thousands of acres of Scotland, but Conservative Members would deny a modest proposal that would allow SNH to act as trustee for, and in the interests of, Scottish people. Does the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) speak for the Scottish people or the American porn queen? I leave that judgment to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, the hon. Member for Dumfries raised a question about Rhum—not rum; the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir Nicholas Fairbairn) is not here. The hon. Member for Dumfries rightly spoke of Rhum being a jewel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously the hon. Gentleman knows more about porn than I do because I did not know of the existence of the lady.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Blairgowrie is a sheltered place, so I accept the hon. Gentleman's assurances. However, I have enlightened him by teaching him about the vicissitudes of market forces that allow great acres of Scotland to fall into the hands of people like that. In the light of that information, I have no doubt that he will reconsider his attitude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had referred to the hon. Member for Dumfries making proper remarks about Rhum being the jewel in the crown of the Nature Conservancy Council for Scotland. Does the hon. Gentleman believe that, under existing market conditions, the NCC, SNH or any other agency could get within a mile of purchasing Rhum or its equivalent? I shall cite the pertinent example of the neighbouring island of Eigg, which came on to the market in the late 1970s or early 1980s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The HIDB tried to buy Eigg for reasons which I believe the hon. Gentleman would approve. It wanted to ensure the regeneration of the island and to promote conservation. One individual, for ideological reasons, set out to stop the HIDB doing that and the subsequent history of Eigg is unhappy compared with that of Rhum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is surprising that the hon. Member for Dumfries would deny to SNH the ability to do what he so admires in respect of Rhum. The hon. Gentleman referred to the HIDB's experience and said that it had never used its compulsory purchase powers. Surely he, rather than me, would take comfort from that. Obviously, I should have liked the HIDB to use its compulsory purchase powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem to which the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs Michie) referred is not the extremity of the powers given to the HIDB, but their narrowness. That did not become evident until the Dr. Green saga on Raasay began. Everyone in their right mind would have believed that the HIBD should have used its compulsory purchase powers to remove the baleful effects of private land ownership, but it could not buy entire estates or areas. Its powers were restricted to buying pocket handkerchiefs of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0104">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>179</span>
land for specific purposes. I am sure that the hon. Member for Dumfries would not want SNH, in pursuance of environmental ends, to be tied down in that way. Given the controls that are exercised by the Secretary of State for Scotland and the limited occasions on which the power is likely to be applied, I hope that the Minister will resist the blandishments of his Back-Bench colleagues. If he does that, he can be assured of the support of Opposition Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know Mar Lodge, but it is too early to decide about its future as the estate is not even on the market. Conservation organisations are considering taking a consortium approach to its purchase. Dave Morris, to whom the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) referred, was at our meeting yesterday. One of his colleagues from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds asked whether we would purchase the estate for some £13 million on the grounds that that was less than the cost of a Tornado. The cost of Tornados comes out of the defence budget, and I fear that £13 million is well beyond the reach of the Scottish Office, certainly at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To respond to my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro), part of the reason why the provision was included in the Bill is that the Countryside Commission has identical powers in section 4(3)(a) of the Countryside Act 1968. Furthermore, the NCC has powers of compulsory purchase for the establishment of nature reserves under section 17 of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. I sincerely believe that, if there had been anything wrong with those powers, my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries would have amemded them when he introduced the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend said that, notwithstanding the fact that the powers exist, they have virtually never been used and that the HIBD is a case in point. If my hon. Friend could draw my attention to an instance when the powers had been abused, there might be a strong argument for removing them now, but I do not believe that there is such an example. The powers are powers of last resort to be used, for example, in emergencies. The safeguard in the Bill is that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will have to give his approval for their use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) referred to electricity and gas pipes. I accept that the powers can be used if there is a possibility of the destruction of historic houses. Another example of when they can be used is in connection with degraded land that has been damaged by mining, and when the owner is unwilling or unreasonably resistant to enter into an agreement to improve the land. Such powers could, however, be used only as a last resort and must be approved by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Countryside (Scotland) Act 1967 has been on the statute book for 23 years, the power of compulsory purchase has not been used. That is a good reason for retaining such a power, as it shows it to be a power of last resort which would never be entered into lightly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>180</span>
The procedures under which a compulsory acquisition would be made are clearly established under subsection (9), which amendment No. 31 seeks to delete, and are set out in the Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) Acts 1947, which provides for a public local inquiry to be held on the issue if necessary. Ultimately, any CPO would be subject to the approval of the Secretary of State. That is an adequate and proper safeguard. It is also a sufficiently detailed and lengthy procedure to ensure that such compulsory acquisition would be sought by SNH only in extreme circumstances. I admit that it is hard to envisage circumstances in which such a power is likely to be required, but that is not a reason to remove it. In addition, my right hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries did not seek to remove such powers when he was piloting his Bill on the Government's behalf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm

I shall continue to stress throughout the passage of the Bill that we intend to establish SNH as a flexible and positive body that can operate under this enabling legislation for many years to come. To that end, we need to allow the legislation to be sufficiently broad to deal with a number of possible unforeseen eventualities. That is why we propose to retain specific CPO powers. That is consistent with other legislation. If there were a general move to remove CPO powers from other legislation because of various complaints, that would be a statable argument, but there is no such move and, therefore, CPO powers are appropriate to the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend and other hon. Members for their comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will recall that both of the Bills that he mentioned were introduced under socialist Governments and that it is unusual for a Conservative Government to introduce compulsory powers. He might also remember that, before the 1979 general election, there was a Bill based on the Porchester committee report, which recommended CPO powers for Exmoor and Dartmoor. We opposed that Bill and it fell at the election. We then introduced the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which operated through voluntary processes, not under CPOs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am against CPOs as a matter of principle, especially when they are not necessary. The Minister has proved that CPOs are not necessary because nobody has ever used them. Perhaps he could tell me whether the CPOs will operate under the district valuer procedure or by free negotiations. It is important to know which procedure will be used.

The hon. Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) mentioned the island of Rhum. We should bear it in mind that it was only through the munificence of the Bullough family that the NCC obtained Rhum. My good constituent Sir Arthur Duncan, who was the chairman of the Nature Conservancy before it became the NCC, knew the Bulloughs well and managed to persuade Lady Bullough to sell Rhum to the NCC for the ludicrous price of £29,000, lock stock and barrel—including
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0105">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>181</span>
the castle and its contents—as long as the island was kept in its original state. I have had to cross swords with the NCC when I have felt that it was going outwith the deed of trust that was implicit in the purchase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Gentleman about the isle of Eigg. We went there one day with a Select Committee and had a very entertaining day with Keith Schellenberg and team.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When there is the possibility of buying an area such as the Mar Lodge estate, the purchase must be considered by the national heritage memorial fund, which is the only donor with funds sufficient to deal with such a purchase. The cost could not come out of the conservation budget of the Scottish Office, which is £19 million a year. We could not give nearly one year's income away to purchase an estate such as Mar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must be borne in mind that the Government have been helpful—for example, in the case of Abernethy. The NCC, with Government approval, gave a substantial capital sum to the RSPB to purchase Abernethy. One wonders, however, whether Abernethy is the better for being run by the RSPB rather than by the previous owner, who was generous with the right of access. I have worrying knowledge of a great deal of vermin that are not being dealt with, as there are no gamekeepers. Careful consideraton must be given to the management of great estates for the benefit of the public and, more important, for the benefit of the wildlife, habitat and scenery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will my hon. Friend the Minister tell us a little about the development board? Does he believe in putting into a Bill legislation that will never be used?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support everything that my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro) said. My hon. Friend the Minister spoke about former coal mines. Perhaps I have a fertile mind, but I had visions of the many ghastly, derelict sites owned by local authorities throughout Scotland. Does my hon. Friend suggest that the compulsory purchase order powers in the Bill would magically restore the natural habitat that existed before the local authorities devastated the sites?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro) raised a fascinating possibility, which I hope that the Minister will explore further in his response. The Minister said that the Scottish Office did not have £13 million at its disposal, but the hon. Member for Dumfries pointed out that partnerships were sometimes possible, as in the case of Abernethy, between a public agency or a quango such as the NCC—or SNH, as it will become. Such partnerships enable public bodies to enter into a corporate venture with voluntary agencies that might be willing to commit resources to the purchase of an estate as valuable as Mar Lodge. Although, according to the Minister, the Scottish Office does not have the resources to buy estates outright, it could play a valuable role in encouraging the NCC or SNH to enter into joint ventures with bodies, such as the RSPB or the Sottish Wildlife Trust, which might be
	<span class='label label-info column'>182</span>
willing to commit private or voluntary resources towards the rescue of that extremely precious estate which lies at the heart of one of our major national nature reserves. Will the Minister comment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry Bellingham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Norfolk, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman's remarks are premature. When that property comes on to the market, some responsible person may want to buy it and run it in a way that would be conducive to the interests of the local community. If the property does not sell and runs the risk of falling into bad repair, other options should be examined, but are we not being premature in our discussion of the fate of Mar Lodge?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman would be right, if a mechanism existed that would allow SNH to sift through the various prospective purchasers of the estate to disqualify on the grounds of public interest those who were clearly unsuitable. I would not oppose a continuing free market in the sale and purchase of estates, so long as the public interest was safeguarded, as it is in the sale and purchase of industrial companies by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which ensures that the sale purchase of industrial companies is in accord with the public interest by maintaining and enhancing competition. A similar rule could be applied to the sale and purchase of estates. Prospective purchasers could be sifted to ensure that the purchaser would safeguard the natural heritage in the public interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellingham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman care to comment on whether the Kluges—who bought Mar Lodge—would have been eliminated as possible owners by such a committee? They spent a huge amount of money on the property. I have not been there, but I have read reports of the vast sums of money that have been spent on the house and outbuildings, of the employment of many extra staff and of many things being done for the benefit of the community. Unfortunately, the marriage of Mr. Kluge to his former porn-queen wife broke down, so the place is now on the market. But would that committee have excluded the Kluges?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reports that I have received about the management of the estate show that vast sums have been spent on the installation of central heating and so on in the residences to be occupied by the Kluges, but little has been done about the environmental quality of the estate. That is a great neglect, as there are some valuable Caledonian pine forests on the estate. The lack of work to regenerate those forests means that one of the few, precious reserves of that sort of woodland is being gradually depleted. The environment of the estate has been neglected, not only by the present owner but also by the previous owner—a Swiss business man.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like a proposal that allowed prospective purchasers to put forward a land management plan for an estate. If the plan could be shown to be consistent with the maintenance of the natural heritage, the sale could go ahead and the price could be established on the open market. There need be no interference with the mechanics of the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0106">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>183</span>
In the absence of such a screening mechanism, however, we have no dependable assurance that a purchaser will look after an estate of such quality as it merits. Does the Minister think that there is a role for the Scottish Office to try to arrange that an estate be purchased by people or bodies who have a commitment to the estate's environmental quality? Or would the Scottish Office, through SNH or the NCC for Scotland be willing, as in the case of Abernethy, to commit funds of its own to make a voluntary purchase?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am prompted to speak again by the intervention of the hon. Member for Norfolk, North-West (Mr. Bellingham) and by some of the things said by the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro). Conservative Members, particularly the hon. Member for Dumfries, have a problem. The hon. Gentleman has a long record of concern for conservation and the environmental interests of the Scottish countryside yet, ideologically, he is prepared to brook no public involvement in the ownership of land or how it is used. That leads him into the paradox of sharing the view of the hon. Member for Norfolk, North-West, who asks, "Why should we worry, because a nice fellow might come along to buy an estate?" Experience shows that it might be a thoroughly bad person who has no interest in the environment or in the well-being of the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always said, and will say again, that the ultimate argument against the private ownership of land is not the bad landowner, but the good landowner. The good landowner creates a regime that protects a community, perhaps giving it an economic subsidy, but, being mortal, he passes on and the whole place is thrown back on to the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spoke earlier of the Island of Gigha, which was owned for many years by the Horlicks hot drinks family. They were model landowners such as I have described, who would have been approved of by the Committee. They sustained the creamery on Gigha, and substantial economic activity which created a thriving community. But that family is now gone. Three times Gigha has been on the market. Each time it was a lottery. No one knew who would take over the islanders' well being and potential as a community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another example is an estate on the island of Mull. I happened to stay with the family who formerly owned that estate, who now live in Appin. They undoubtedly ran the estate along model lines. There was sustained employment and 30 people were working on the estate. The estate was sold to the rock group Genesis, who have hardly ever visited it, who care nothing for it and who were probably advised by an economic advisor that its purchase would be good speculation. The house has fallen into disrepair. Trees have been planted in the wrong places. Stock has been cleared. The place is an utter shambles, and sustains nobody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to start a debate about the ownership of land in Scotland, which we can do in one form or
	<span class='label label-info column'>184</span>
another at any stage, but Conservative Members have to face the contradiction of their position. If they care about the Scottish countryside they must care about who owns and manages it. To be so hostile to the concept of the public interest as to seek to prevent the removal of a modest line in the Bill is in conflict with that concern and an assertion that there is no such thing as a public interest—that the only interest that matters is the right to have a free market. That view will never be accepted in Scotland. People will never acknowledge the concept of ownership of large areas of land. Trusteeship is what matters, and those who have owned such estates have often been lamentable trustees of the land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend the Minister first tell me about district valuers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, of course. First, the district valuer would be used. I must make it absolutely clear that the powers conferred by clause 5 are unlikely to be appropriate and that it is even more unlikely that the Secretary of State would approve the purchase of Mar Lodge in that form, but there is no reason why the natural heritage memorial fund could not be involved in a consortium approach. The trust was formed, and operators, under rules agreed with the Inland Revenue for inheritance and transfer for taxation purposes, but it may be interested in what hon. Members have said on that subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker), I can confirm that the compulsory purchase powers in clause 5 are available only for the implementation of development projects of limited scope. They could not be used to acquire tracts of derelict land unless they were needed for a development project meeting the criteria of clause 5(2). My hon. Friend will be aware of the Central Scotland Woodland Company and its activities to clean up derelict sites. There may be other ways in which to help. If he lets me know what areas he has in mind, I will reply fully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro) mentioned Abernethy. That was not compulsorily acquired. It was bought on the open market by the RSPB, but with grant assistance from the NCC. I come back to my original point, that when my right hon. Friend was piloting the Wildlife and Countryside Bill through the House in 1981, he did not find it necessary to remove the CPO powers. If there had been any grounds for believing that they could have an adverse effect on the community, I have no doubt that my right hon. Friend would have removed them. The real safeguard is that the consent of the Secretary of State has to be obtained. He would undoubtedly take account of the very strong public interest in the acquisition when deciding whether it should go ahead. With those reassurances, I hope that my right hon. Friend will not find it necessary to press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a useful debate. As a result of all the horror cast by the Opposition, we have, at least, received an assurance that the issue
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0107">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>185</span>
could be examined by the national heritage memorial fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) often spoils his argument by being provocative and irresponsible. There is a tremendous difference between ownership and management of land. I support the highest standard of husbandry and good management, and would never countenance estates being run down and destroyed through owners' lack of interests. The hon. Gentleman must accept that I am reluctant that the Government should own and manage land, especially as we expect the Ministry of Defence to dispose of land. We should be careful about adding to the stock of land owned by the Government. It is better to proceed with the marine nature reserves about which we spoke earlier. The government have many ways of being involved in management and management agreements, and I hope that that is how they will proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that Magnus Magnusson will be chairman of SNH gives me the greatest confidence. I am sure that he and the SNH team will not buy up land unnecessarily. I am anxious about the district valuer. I should prefer reasonable, fair negotiations between a willing seller and a willing buyer than compulsory purchases and all the difficulties that they entail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister is over-generous in referring to me as right honourable. Perhaps it was an oversight, but it is very unlikely that I shall ever reach that status. I should not like the error to be perpetuated indefinitely, however. I thank him for his reply and all hon. Members who have participated in the debate for their comments. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 15, in page 4, line 19, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(d) provide land management grants for agriculture.".</p></blockquote>
Alas, we shall not get to wolves and wild boars today, but doubtless the nation will be agog on Thursday morning. The amendment tries to embody the concept, which is now increasingly common in both agricultural and environmental circles, that the most appropriate means of subsidy to rural communities is not headage payments on livestock. Payment should be made directly to the people who, on behalf of the whole community, maintain and manage the land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The extension of that concept will not be a result of this Bill, but it is increasingly widely accepted as sensible. In many areas of Scotland, the environment has suffered because the financial return to the people living there is determined by a head count of animals. In some cases, the land has not been best served by maintaining that practice. Common agricultural and environmental policies are moving away from intensification of production towards quality and environmentally friendly methods of farming and other economic activities in rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The good hill livestock compensatory allowance settlement that was reached a couple of weeks ago alleviated some anxiety. The people who will lose
	<span class='label label-info column'>186</span>
out under the Bill are not those who live in the prosperous rural areas, but those who live in the fragile rural upland areas. If there is to be a regime that pushes agricultural support away from the rural upland communities into more productive areas, it will be difficult for residents in rural areas to maintain their livelihood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Coincidentally, SNH will be concerned mainly with the rural areas. I am anxious not to give the impression of wishing to subsidise artificial communities by arguing that people should be paid to stay in those areas. Those who live there have performed a service in terms of farming, maintaining and managing the uplands. Scottish society would be greatly impoverished if its hill-farming and crofting areas—the marginal agricultural areas—were denuded of population because it had become impossible to maintain a livelihood from agricultural activity. That is the current trend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) can testify—as can other Conservative Members who represent marginal upland areas—that hill farms in crofting areas are being lost for ever. Although the population in the crofting areas has been maintained superficially, an increasing number of people have moved. People are moving into waged employment, when it is available, to the detriment of agricultural activity. That process is very much under way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would provide SNH with powers to pay a community that has a clear environmental interest in keeping the population alive, healthy and engaged in the management of land, in recognition of the service that it performs. It would provide for a financial responsibility, and I hope that the Minister will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Scottish Natural Heritage will inherit the powers enjoyed by the two existing organisations, the NCC for Scotland and the CC. Agreements with owners could be formed, but they would need to relate to the natural heritage rather than agriculture, although an agreement could have an effect on agricultural practices. In other words, SNH is to have a general power to make agreements or to devise schemes or projects in relation to the management of agricultural land. In addition, SNH will be able to use its development projects or scheme powers under clause 5(1) for experimental and demonstration purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Office has spelt out our intention to integrate broader environmental objectives more closely into agricultural support schemes. That offers a more effective approach to promoting farming practices that respect the countryside. It is becoming clear that the European Commission takes a similar view as it develops ideas for reforming the common agricultural policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, we do not see an advantage in extending a general power to SNH to pay grants for agricultural management. Indeed, we envisage considerable pitfalls in pursuing such a policy as it would duplicate those powers. I invite the Committee to agree that the amendment should be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall undertake a review of environmentally sensitive areas.
