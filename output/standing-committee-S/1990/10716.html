	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Ian Lang)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the matter of the Scottish economy.</p></blockquote>
This is a good time to debate the Scottish economy. Given the mythology that will doubtless colour the debate once Opposition Members start to contribute to it later, it might be sensible to point out at the outset that the last time the Labour party was running the Scottish economy, from 1974–79, its record on economic growth in Scotland was of less than 1 per cent. per annum. Inflation reached a peak of 27 per cent. and averaged 15 per cent., industrial relations were in complete disarray and the unions imposed their will on the Government and individuals. Unemployment doubled in Scotland, productivity was abysmal and confidence in the economy was at a post-war low. The Labour party's current approach shows little change from the approach that produced those outcomes in the 1970s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By contrast, the Scottish economy of today, after the Conservative party's tenure, is forward-looking and competitive. One evidence of this is the growth in self-employment. Over the seven years to last December, self-employment in Scotland rose by over three times the rate of employment growth generally. The number of registered companies in Scotland at the beginning of this year had increased by over two-thirds since the beginning of 1980. Those figures epitomise the greater spirit of confidence and enterprise that now characterises Scottish industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the Secretary of State that such confidence does not exist in Dumfries—an area that he and I know well as we represent neighbouring constituencies—where Carnation has made 65 workers redundant, and the Wolesey factory, which has been there for generations, will close in October with the loss of 183 jobs. What is the Secretary of State doing about that? The people of Dumfries are not optimistic and have no such confidence. They are looking forward to the general election when they will be able to have not only a Labour Government but a Labour Member of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the people of Dumfries will have more sense than to risk that folly, and that they will be keen to return my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro). The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) should have contained himself and been patient a little longer because I was about to say that I readily accept that problems remain. Our long-standing dependence on traditional heavy industries has meant that the transition to a modern economy has taken longer and been more difficult to achieve than in many other countries, but it is the overall picture that matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
I do not think that anyone could seriously dispute that the Scottish economy is beginning the 1990s in far better shape than it entered the 1980s. Perhaps the best indicator of that is the fact that Scottish gross domestic product per head was almost one quarter higher in real terms in 1989 than in 1979. In other words, after accounting for inflation, the people of Scotland are now making £5 of GDP for every £4 made in the past. The current levels of Scottish GDP per head and personal incomes are higher than in any other area of northern Britain, the west midlands and Wales—a sure sign of a relatively prosperous economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not seek to deny that, according to the latest figures, manufacturing output in Scotland, in common with the United Kingdom as a whole, has recently been falling. However, that has to be kept in perspective. Manufacturing output in Scotland in 1990 was 12 per cent. above its level in 1979. With productivity rising at an average of over 5 per cent. per annum in the 1980s, Scotland's productivity record has been higher than that of the United Kingdom as a whole and, indeed, higher than that achieved in the USA, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and Canada. In addition, Scottish manufactured exports rose by some 20 per cent. in real terms in the 10 years to 1989. Indeed, Scottish manufacturers in 1989 exported roughly £19,000 worth of goods per employee—a fifth higher than in the United Kingdom generally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Salmond 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Banff and Buchan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to take the Secretary of State away from his brief, but will he concede that in 1990 manufacturing output in Scotland fell by 14·5 points and, furthermore, that investment-good production in Scotland, which is a clear indicator of a move into recession, fell by over 30 per cent? Can the Secretary of State name a single year in recent Scottish economic history in which there was such a fall in investment-good production?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not yet have all the figures for 1990, but after the dramatic expansion in investment, output and employment in 1990, the results have been less encouraging. That must be set against the background of real growth, about which I have spoken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taking these facts together, it is difficult to see how Scottish manufacturing can be described as being in a state of decline. Certainly, we are seeing a temporary downturn, in common with the United Kingdom as a whole. It would be surprising if that were not the case, given the integrated nature of the Scottish and United Kingdom economies, but it would surely be misguided to read across from the present situation to any prediction of the future performance of Scottish manufacturing industry. Recessions, by their nature, are temporary. There are differing views on how soon we may expect to see recovery in the United Kingdom as a whole, but on the basis of economic indicators, business surveys and the views of independent forecasters, there is no reason to doubt that the recession in Scotland will be briefer and involve a smaller loss of output than in the United Kingdom as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Worthington 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clydebank and Milngavie)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State says that Scottish manufacturing industry is in good heart. How can he make such a claim when a third of manufacturing jobs have been lost in the past 12 years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0368">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman forgets that most of those jobs were lost as a result of the chaos to which the Labour party reduced the economy in the late 1970s. Manufacturing employment has risen by 8,000 or 9,000 over the past couple of years. It may have fallen slightly recently, but employment in manufacturing increased in 1989 in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In support of the view that I have advanced, the latest CBI/Business Strategies survey of manufacturers, conducted in April this year, showed Scotland to be the only part of the United Kingdom where manufacturers reported an increase in capacity utilisation since the beginning of the year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas Graham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Renfrew, West and Inverclyde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I must press on. I shall give way later. The survey showed that only four out of 10 Scottish firms reported themselves to be working below cpapcity, compared with eight out of 10 in such areas as Wales and the west midlands. Those findings are reflected in the consensus view of independent forecasters that the Scottish economy will do relatively better in 1991 than other parts of the United Kingdom. If Opposition Members need to be more convinced of the strength of the Scottish economy, I shall share with them one development that I find especially heartening. I hope that the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley shares my view. Over the years—perhaps as long as he and I can remember, which is quite some time—	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind those who are not members of the Committee, especially the press, that they are not entitled to be in this part of the Room. There is a place for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a view on which I am sure that the Committee is united.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the years, we have been used to an annual net loss of population out of Scotland. I am delighted to say that in the past two years that trend has been reversed. Scotland now has an annual net migration gain. Last year there was a net inward migration balance of 11,800 from other parts of the United Kingdom, and 1,700 from overseas. There could surely be no more telling commentary on the increasing strength of the Scottish economy and the excellence of Scotland as a place to live and work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Secretary of State leaves the issue of the quality of life, and Scotland as an excellent place to live and work, will he comment on a matter related to his Scottish Natural Heritage Bill. Will he explain why the distinguished vice-chancellor of Durham university, Sir Fred Holliday, who was appointed by the Government in April 1991 as chairman of the Joint Committee of the Councils for Nature Conservation, chose to resign on a matter of principle, resulting from the actions of the Secretary of State?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whatever reasons Professor Holliday may have given, he did not mention any actions of mine. That is essentially a matter for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will be able to pursue the matter with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a vital contributory factor to the reverse in the migratory trend in Scotland. The performance of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Scottish economy is directly related to the economic restructuring that has taken place in past years. The Scottish economy of today is much more broadly based and diversified than it was even a decade ago. That is particularly significant when we compare present economic conditions with those in the early 1980s. Then, a severe world recession coincided with the restructuring of British and Scottish industry. The adjustments that had to be made were massive because industrial productivity was much lower and employment was more heavily concentrated in industries undergoing long-term decline. Now that many of the adjustments that had to be made have been made, industry is far better placed to withstand the present difficulties. That is not just the Government's view; it is the view of 83 per cent. of the United Kingdom's largest manufacturers in a recent survey by Investors in Industry. I believe that that view has particular force in Scotland. Gone are the days when the Scottish economy was dependent on a narrow industrial base with little room for manoeuvre if things went wrong. Today, the skills and aptitudes developed from years of experience in the traditional industries are finding expression across the whole range of industrial activity in modern Scotland. Incoming industrialists testify to the fact that the Scottish labour force is one of the most flexible and adaptable in the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see the 1990s as opening unparalleled opportunities for Scottish industry. With the advent of the single European market those opportunities will present themselves particularly in Europe, but I am confident that Scottish industry will also continue to develop markets in the rest of the world. I am confident, too, of the calibre of Scottish industry and of its ability to go on contributing to the high standard of living of the Scottish people. That was clearly achieved in the 1980s. I believe that there is every prospect that it will continue to be achieved in the 1990s.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monklands, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State referred specifically to Europe. I should like to ask him a specific and important question about the European Community initiatave called Horizon, which involves training opportunities for disabled and disadvantaged young people and job prospects. I have a statement from the Department of Employment that 15 towns or cities have claimed some of the available funds. They are exclusively in England. Can the Secretary of State assure me that the scheme applies to Scotland and that our youngsters will benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy so to assure the hon. Gentleman. I am sure that the authorities responsible for bidding for assistance under that scheme are aware of it and are already processing their bids.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is against the background of a fundamentally strong economy that we should view current problem areas, such as the steel industry. Let me make it clear that I share the disappointment of the workers and the local communities at recent events. We have had to recognise that the steel industry as a whole, not only in the United Kingdom but throughout Europe, has had to react to circumstances of changing demand. Those circumstances cannot be controlled either by British Steel or by the Government. Our priorities must now lie in promoting new economic development in north Lanarkshire and stimulating new employment opportunities to replace those that have been lost. Indeed, that is what we have already started to do. We have directed some £29 million in additional funding into
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0369">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Lanarkshire in the current year. In response to the report of the Lanarkshire working group, which was set up by Government, we have given several commitments, including approval for a new district general hospital at Wishaw and the commissioning of a study on the upgrading of the remaining section of the A8. We have also undertaken to consider the case for an enterprise zone and to give Lanarkshire's needs priority in the decisions that we shall be taking later this year on public expenditure in 1992–93 and beyond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local authorities are playing an active part, too. The district council's extensive factory-building programmes have been boosted by additional resources this year, and the work of the regional council to help ensure that redundant workers receive the counselling and support they need has been backed by the Government through the urban programme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As it is crucial to any plan for Lanarkshire that local authorities provide matching funds for most of the infrastructural development that is suggested by the Lanarkshire working party, is the Secretary of State now willing to give the commitment that local authorities will be able to find money to match such development costs? Otherwise, there is little or no prospect of the Government's promises producing anything.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman is aware and as I have just said, we have already enhanced district council budgets to enable them to embark on further factory building—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a regional council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Regional and district councils. When we come to consider their needs for the next financial year, we shall of course take account of local circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our experience with the steel industry has highlighted the continuing need to diversify the economy. That is an essential, on-going process. Above all, we must continue to build up our strength in the new high technology industries. It is natural that we should seek to conserve our existing industrial base so far as we can, but we have to balance that with the need to promote new business formation and, particularly, inward investment in those sectors which we expect to form the basis of our economic strength in the next century.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is these industries which have been at the heart of the transformation of the Scottish industrial scene over the past three decades.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gavin Strang 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for giving way. I have a horrible feeling that he is about to move on from the steel industry. Is he accepting the complete demise of the industry as casually as it appears? He must agree that it is crucial to the Scottish economy. There are thousands of jobs at stake in Lanarkshire, but there are also many industries that use steel and by closing down Scotland's steel industry we shall for ever more be denying those industries the opportunity to move to Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman is aware, it is not the Government who are closing down the steel industry. We have done our best to prevent it, but we have to acknowledge that we cannot resist the tide of economic trends and that in the present economic circumstances British Steel has had to make a commercial decision that
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
has reduced employment levels and prospects. A small proportion only of steel consumed in Scotland is produced in Scotland: under 3 per cent. That factor must be considered in the equation. I am responsible for how the Government can react and what we can do to help the economy in general to respond to and recover from the present position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a measure of the transformation of the economy that we now have more than 40,000 people employed in electronics in Scotland. Recent developments have shown that much of the industry's potential has yet to be fully realised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Secretary of State aware that only this week Lawtexs has called the receiver in to the old Linwood plant where it employs 124 workers? The reason that the company has given for doing so is the deep recession and the high interest rates inflicted by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not doubt that the present recession—which is not limited to the United Kingdom but can be found in many other countries, probably in the majority of those represented at today's G7 meeting—creates difficult trading conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have, however, faced up to the need to reduce inflation through a high interest rate policy that is now working, with the rate of inflation down to about a half of what it was a year ago. As a consequence, interest rates have been able to fall by 4 per cent. without jeopardising our exchange rate. That is a remarkable achievement, and one that bodes well for the future of the economy in Linwood, as elsewhere in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that we retain the attractions of Scotland as a location for inward investment. The figures that my hon. Friend the Minister responsible for industry was able to publish earlier this week show what a successful year 1990 was for inward investment. In that year alone Locate in Scotland and the Scottish Office Industry Department secured 63 inward investment decisions—almost the same as the previous year—with planned company investment of some £394 million and intentions to create or safeguard over 10,000 jobs. Yet again, Scotland has succeeded in demonstrating its attractions as an inward investment base.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Secretary of State not realise that employment in an area such as Edinburgh is dependent on white-collar jobs? It is a great financial centre, but jobs in investment are not coming on line. For the first time, unemployment in Edinburgh is higher than in other parts of Scotland. Is not that an indictment of the Government's policies? Not only have they failed to attract investment into manufacturing industry; they have failed to attract it into new industries and financial and other services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the financial services industry has doubled its employment since the Government came into office, the hon. Gentleman's case does not stand up. There are white-collar jobs, for which the Government could be said to be responsible, and we have a good record on the dispersal of civil service employment in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have sought to give a lead in encouraging industries in the financial and other sectors to relocate in Scotland from London and other parts of the south-east. Of the jobs identified for relocation in our original 1979 Government dispersal programme, more

than 35 per cent. have come to Scotland. While civil service jobs overall have been reduced by 130,000, the share of such jobs in Scotland has risen from 9·7 per cent. in 1979 to 10·4 per cent. now. That is the measure of the Government's commitment to providing good-quality jobs for Scotland and seeking to give a lead for others to follow.

When we talk about new investment and new jobs we must not forget the continuing contribution of our more traditional industries. Perhaps I should say a word about our newest traditional industry—North sea oil. The prospects for that are the best for many years. Investment in the industry last year, at £3·5 billion, was up by over 30 per cent. on the previous year. Exploration and appraisal activity is forging ahead. Employment in wholly or partly oil-related companies in Scotland is approaching 100,000. Scottish fabrication yards have healthier order books than for several years and are consistently winning major orders in a healthy competitive market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gordon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wholly acknowledge the present healthy state of the industry. Does the Secretary of State accept that the north-east of Scotland is running against the buffers of severe constraints in the form of a housing crisis and problems with infrastructure? Will he consider the capital consent that is available to local authorities and other agencies to enable them to cope with the success of the oil and gas industries? If he does not, there will be a constraint.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said to the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson), we examine the needs and circumstances of every area when we consider the allocation of resources to be made available to those areas. The success in the north-east has been achieved by private enterprise and it is not beyond the capacity of private enterprise to meet some of the needs that are developing in that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Long-term prospects for the oil industry are also encouraging. Identified reserves offoil and gas will take us well into the next century and existing reserves are constantly being reappraised. The central North sea is set to become an area of increasing activity with particular emphasis on gas development. The Government's policy of opening up the gas and electricity markets has been a major positive factor in offshore industry in the area. It is clear, too, that the fiscal policies for the offshore industry have had much to do with the industry's general recovery in recent years. The success of those policies had been clearly demonstrated in the high level of interest shown in the 12th and frontier rounds under which licences were recently granted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State mentioned the long-term security of the offshore industry, but what are the implications for the fabrication yards, especially those at Ardersier and Hi-Fab?

Scottish Enterprise has been made possible by the underlying strength of the Scottish economy. It is a logical development of the policies that have liberated Scottish business and industry and given them a proper say in their
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
affairs. That is the approach that we need to sustain success—success that is increasingly the hallmark of the Scottish economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman, who has been generous in giving way.

Will he assure us that if, during the parliamentary recess, there is a hostile bid by Hanson for ICI, he will oppose that hostile bid for a British company that has an important presence in Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I can give no long-term guarantee. Even security for three or four years is encouraging. The yards must be competitive. It is encouraging that they are succeeding in securing so much of the available work and performing with increasing professionalism and competitiveness. That is good for the future not only of the offshore industry but of the development of Scotland as a base of expertise in the offshore industry that can be exploited in other parts of the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the greatest stimulus to business and development in Scotland has come through the Scottish Enterprise initiative. In Scottish Enterprise, we have provided a structural framework that is fully compatible with the Government's approach to business and which will give the Scottish economy the competitive edge that it needs in today's world. With Scottish Enterprise at the centre, and a network of local enterprise companies throughout Scotland, the new structure will secure a balance betwen national and local strategy that will be unique to Scotland. Indeed, it will represent real administrative devolution—devolution that makes sense and creates new opportunities, rather than new burdens, for the people of Scotland. It is that essentially local focus of the new initiative that explains the enthusiasm that it has attracted from local business and other community leaders throughout Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The success that we have generated over the past few years needs to be carefully nurtured. It can be sustained only in an economic climate favourable to growth and investment—above all, in a climate in which business is not crippled by the sort of financial burdens that it had to bear in the past. That is what profoundly disturbs me about the policies of the Labour party. We have already seen the effects of those policies on the Scottish economy—annual growth of less than 1 per cent. per annum between 1974 and 1979 compared with 2·5 per cent. in the eight years to 1989 and average inflation of 15·5 per cent., more than double the average under this Government. Those facts surely speak for themselves. They are a telling commentary on what a future Labour Government would mean for Scotland.

The Labour party stands ready to mount a three-pronged attack on the Scottish economy which would demoralise and impoverish Scotland, and consign it to the sidelines of Europe. Labour proposes to impose a national minimum wage that would cost, in the first stage, up to 100,000 jobs in Scotland. 	<i>[Laughter.]</i> I do not know why Opposition Members regard that as a laughing matter. It would be intensely damaging, and the lowest-paid, most vulnerable jobs would be the first to go.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall not give way to the hon. Lady.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every Labour Government have left office with unemployment higher than when they came in. For the Labour party to remain wedded to that job-destroying policy beggars belief. Under Labour, instead of low pay, there would be no pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, Labour would give the green light to a business rates free-for-all. It would abolish capping and reverse the trend towards harmonisation and lower rates. That would force businesses to bear the burden of the inevitable sky-high Labour council spending. Once again, we shall have the spectre of boarded-up shops and businesses the length and breadth of Scotland. They will be driven out of business or out of the country by intolerable rates bills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third prong of Labour's attack will be the establishment of a tax-raising Scottish Assembly. The low-tax, low-intervention conditions that are essential for economic growth would be thrown away. Higher personal and business taxation would be the order of the day. The Scottish Constitutional Convention does not mention tax-varying powers to enable an assembly to cut taxes, but tax-raising powers to fund additional spending. Labour's proposals for Scotland would inevitably increase taxation, which would drive out investment, undermine pay increases, reduce the standard of living and destroy jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. Next question. 	<i>[Laughter.]</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who thinks that Governments are better when they are closer to those they govern; that more Governments mean better government; and that more taxation is better than less taxation? The Labour party seems to be under the delusion that there are those who would like more government and more taxation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend is absolutely right and Scottish Electric would do well to listen to the warnings that he puts across so effectively on the threat of a Labour Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As well as increasing taxes, Labour would extend the clutches of the state and leave no area of the economy free from interference. The Scottish Constitutional Convention proclaims a plan to extend control to over two thirds of the jobs in Scotland's private sector. Strategic planning powers and central control would be the hallmark of Labour's economic policy. What failed in the 1960s and 1970s would fail again in the 1990s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tragedy is that such an approach would be out of step with the new mood of Europe as we move towards 1992. Scotland will have enormous opportunities and will face new challenges in the years ahead. It is no longer enough to look at the Scottish economy in isolation. Our
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
domestic market will extend from Aberdeen to Athens to the Algarve. [HON. MEMBERS: "Come on."] The free movement of goods and capital that the changes in 1992 will bring will mean that all business, Scottish and otherwise,, will go where the economic climate is best. That would not be Scotland, under a Labour Government with high taxes and centralised control, and the result would be devastating for the Scottish economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our overriding goal is to create the conditions in which industry and commerce can flourish. We have pursued relentlessly a policy geared to achieving low inflation. We have cut, reformed and abolished taxes. We have done away with unnecessary controls and released our economy from petty regulations. We have got public spending under control. We have reformed trade union laws to give trade unions back to their members and restore responsibility in industrial relations. Last year Scotland enjoyed fewer strikes than for 50 years. We are not complacent. We must constantly strive to improve the economy, to remove constraints and encourage enterprise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Compared with the inadequacies, the decline and the failures of the 1970s, Scotland's economy is an economy transformed. Under this Government, Scotland has shown that it can compete with the best. In the 1980s we grew faster than almost every country in western Europe, and Scotland became more prosperous than ever before as a result. By following Conservative policies the same will happen again in the 1990s.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Garscadden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State is in danger of becoming a joke. The one redeeming feature of his performance was that at one point he himself had to break into laughter at his own efforts. I hope that when he reflects he will see that such a diatribe is not a great contribution to the debate about Scotland's future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I start with a slight, but important diversion. Did the Secretary of State watch the "World in Action" programme last night? It was an account of the use of sophisticated eavesdropping techniques, described as leaving Ministers in the dark, to tap telephones and intercept mail. It is apparently organised by GCHQ, which has apparently learnt nothing from history or past experience. It is sinister and disturbing, and I raise it with the Secretary of State because one of the people described in the programme as a victim of interference with and surveillance of mail was my colleague, Mr. Campbell Christie, the general secretary of the Scottish Trades Union Congress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the Secretary of State is responsible for the control of such activity within Scotland, therefore, has a direct interest. I do not want to delay the Committee long, but I hope that the Secretary of State will at least undertake to look into those events and write to me on the matter. It is significant and it would be wrong not to use this debate to raise it. If the Secretary of State wishes to give me an assurance, I should be grateful. The matter should be investigated thoroughly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

the STUC, who lives and works in Scotland and is general secretary of a body that has a major interest in the Scottish economy, have come before the Secretary of State for Scotland? If he says that he does not know about it, that is outrageous. It is a matter of the utmost importance when the privacy of citizens of this country is being interfered with. It is directly relevant to the Scottish economy because Mr. Christie has a major influence on it. It is disgraceful of the Secretary of State to say nothing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is too long an intervention. I allowed the shadow Secretary of State some leeway, but I cannot allow this to go on. We are debating the Scottish economy. I rule that the issue is not a matter for the Committee. There are other places, such as the Chamber, where hon. Members can raise it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept that ruling and I shall not pursue the matter. I am grateful to you, Mr. Martin, for allowing the matter to be raised. I am sure that the Secretary of State has listened to what has been said, will establish whether he has responsibility and will write to me to tell me what he has discovered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. You say that the matter has nothing to do with the Scottish economy, but the script states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"One target provoked a notorious row inside GCHQ. One official refused on principle to handle telexes from East European trades unions to the head of the Scottish TUC".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have given a ruling to the Committee and the hon. Gentleman is on the verge of challenging it. I have stated that this is an important matter and that there are opportunities for hon. Members to take it up, but not during this debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is not a point of order. I say that to the hon. Gentleman again. I hope that he will not read from a script. I have given a ruling on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can now come to the mainstream of the debate—the Scottish economy. I suspect that the condition of Scotland causes every member of the Committee great concern. The Scottish Office has raised complacency to the state of an art. It has become, in a sense, the art of the state. On the evidence of what we have heard, the Secretary of State is living in an unreal world. His only weapon is to deny the obvious and to hope that the growing crisis will go away. That is a dangerously optimistic assumption. The question is whether, as Ministers claim, the recession is shorter and shallower in Scotland or whether, as the evidence increasingly suggests, the worst is still to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Between the first and second half of 1990, the index of production and construction in Scotland fell by 6·6 per cent., more than three times the fall in the United Kingdom as a whole. In the same period, our manufacturing output was down by 9·8 per cent. The equivalent United Kingdom figure was 2·8 per cent. Production of investment goods fell by 22 per cent., almost five times the United Kingdom figure. There are few grounds for optimism when we consider those facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a sad continuation of a depressing story. The record of the past decade is one of failure. The Secretary of State was selective in the facts that he used. Between
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
1979 and 1989, gross domestic product grew by an average of 1·7 per cent. per annum in Scotland. In the United Kingdom, it was 2·1 per cent. Comparison with our European competitors is simply embarrassing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When faced with the evidence, the Secretary of State manufactures a modest triumph by excluding the south-east of England. I have had a long correspondence with the right hon. Gentleman and he did that again in his speech today. In order to get someone he can beat, he has to compare Scotland with the bits of the United Kingdom that are performing evidently badly. It is like discussing European monetary union and, to make the figures a little more comfortable, taking no account of the German economy. The right hon. Gentleman saws off the south-east of England, then triumphantly says that Scotland is not doing quite as badly as some people imagine. It is gerrymandering on the wildest scale and the Secretary of State knows it. Unemployment is rising and will get worse. Last month, seasonally adjusted, the increase was 5,200.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once and for all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that unemployment is rising, but in fact there are tens of thousands more people employed this year in Scotland than when the Government came to power. Furthermore, from his experience of the south-east of England, where one cannot afford to buy a dog kennel, far less a house, the hon. Gentleman must know that it provides a rotten quality of life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A comparison of the figures in March 1979 with those in December 1990, which are the most recently available, shows that the number of people in employment in Scotland is down by 84,000 or 4·1 per cent. Of course, there is apparently an increase in the Government's figure, but that is because they include 56,000 people who are on training schemes and take no account of the fact that the figure includes an increase of 100,000 women in part-time work. A number of other factors give rise to that figure, including an estimate of the self-employed, which is open to serious question. The Government's claim does not even begin to stand up to examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is incontrovertible that there are only 19,500 jobs available in jobcentres. The increase in unemployment is 5,200. On a proper basis of comparison, the unemployment figure that the right hon. Gentleman inherited in 1979 was 140,300. It is now 220,000. The Secretary of State is remarkably short-sighted if he claims that as a story of success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When followed the passages from the Secretary of State that I genuinely could not believe as I sat here and listened to them. He told us that it was difficult to see how we could say that Scotland's manufacturing base was in decline. Let us look at the facts. They come not from a Labour document, but the Scottish Office's Statistical Bulletin produced in June this year on components of change in Scottish manufacturing employment between 1979 and 1989. In that period manufacturing employment fell in Edinburgh by 31 per cent., in Dundee by 43 per cent., in Motherwell by 45 per cent., in Glasgow by 52 per cent. and in Renfrew by 57 per cent. How the Secretary of State can tell the Committee that our manufacturing base is in good heart passes all comprehension.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has no god-given right to intervene. He can just haul his wheesht for a minute or two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State went on to say, as the hon. Gentleman will no doubt be glad to note, that there had been an increase in manufacturing industry of 8,000 to 9,000 jobs in the past year or two. I do not know where those figures come from. Perhaps he will write and tell me in the next few days. The most recent figures in the Statistical Bulletin are those for 1984–89, which show a further drop in manufacturing of 18,000 jobs. I challenge the Secretary of State to establish that increase of 8,000 or 9,000 on any reasonably based period in recent times. Just this once, I give way to the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State was generous in giving way and I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman has given way. I thank him for that. Can he include in his diatribe the important information on productivity and unit labour costs which have much more to do with the well-being of manufacturing industry than the total numbers employed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer the hon. Gentleman to the index of production and construction, which is probably the key. Industrial production and the construction sector are down 6·6 per cent., which is a three times greater fall than in the United Kingdom as a whole. If that is the sort of figure on which he wants to base a political argument, I shall listen to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not just a case of the manufacturing sector. Good news is scarce in the service sector too. Growth has been slower than in comparable countries and there is little room for confidence with retail sales down nationally by 0·5 per cent. in May. The job losses in Goldberg's, Lewis's and Burton's will be bad news for workers in the retail sector in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the financial sector flourishes. I take the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) and I would like to be optimistic, although those on the inside track have expressed some doubts. No doubt the Secretary of State saw the large profile in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> last Tuesday of Mr. Alistair Dickson, who is one of the best known commercial lawyers in Scotland. He made the point that big Scottish deals are increasingly being completed in London and no comparable business is coming north of the border. As he trenchantly put it:
	<br><blockquote><p>"To suggest that Edinburgh is the second financial centre of the UK is nonsense."</p></blockquote>
I do not necessarily accept that judgment, but it is certainly a corrective against the easy assumption that the financial and service sectors are doing well, which is used as a sort of alibi for the disasters that are overcoming us in the industrial sphere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will doubtless be accused of taking a gloomy view. I will be accused of delivering diatribes—the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) has already done so—and of being a professional pessimist, but I must plead not guilty. There is a great deal of support for the rather sad story that I have to tell.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take the Fraser of Allander commentary on which the Government are often glad to rely. It was published on 27 June and said:
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The outlook for investment expenditure is unremittingly bleak."</p></blockquote>
That is not a judgment of the Scottish economy in good heart. It went on to make the point that the long-term problems have not resulted from the depths of the recession in 1980–81, but have been caused since then by our poor performance and our stuttering recovery. Even taking account of slightly better years recently in terms of growth, Scotland has failed to keep pace with its southern neighbour. I am sure that Ministers who read the Fraser of Allander commentary would not have enjoyed it. The editor, Jim Love, told the press:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We'll be lucky to see much of an upturn this year at all. We are likely to crawl into 1992."</p></blockquote>
We are told that 1992 is the year of opportunity and challenge, but in the view of the Fraser of Allander Institute, the sum total of the Government's achievement has been to send the Scottish economy into Europe on its hands and knees burdened by recession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I concede that we could consider other views. Several surveys have been undertaken. The Secretary of State referred to the report from the Confederation of British Industry. He took great consolation from it; I did not. It is little consolation for me to note from that report that Scottish manufacturers recorded
	<br><blockquote><p>"the sharpest decline in output volumes over the past four months for over 10 years".</p></blockquote>
The headline conclusion of the business survey of the Scottish chambers of commerce was that business confidence had improved, but it went on to say that confidence remained low. It is always wise to look behind the headlines. The interpretation of that headline depends on what is understood by "improvement". The survey recorded that
	<br><blockquote><p>"in manufacturing optimism about the general business situation remains low and negative with a net balance of 8 per cent. of respondants now less optimistic than they were three months ago."</p></blockquote>
A formidable balance of 37 per cent. took a more gloomy view of the general business situation than a year ago. The chambers found that orders and sales had lessened and stocks had run down. There was a decline in demand and investment finance. That is not everyone's definition of "improvement".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>On 13 June Dunn and Bradstreet International produced its report, which said that in the first half of 1991, bankruptcies rose by 80 per cent. and liquidations by 51 per cent. in Scotland compared with the first half of 1990. Peat Marwick McLintock—not a socialist cell—chimed in with the news that company receiverships had risen in the same period by 93 per cent. Faced with those facts and figures, I do not understand why the Secretary of State cannot face up to the reality of what has happened and say what he intends to do about it.</p></blockquote>
Last week I received a mailshot from an eager publisher offering practical books on insolvency law at a handsome discount. The circular said that it was important to take up the opportunity because it offers "a real professional challenge" and

For months we have been told that the recession is bottoming out. We were promised recovery by the middle of the year, then by the second half of the year and finally by the end of the year. Recovery is a mirage pursued ever more desperately by Ministers. Every month the emphasis is more on rhetoric and interpretation and less on the facts. But such ingenuity cannot hide what is happening: the prospects are bleak and, for Scotland, there is hard going ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to ask the Secretary of State some questions about the whisky industry, which is important as an employer and as an export earner. It has met fierce competition especially in the European markets. The volume of sales in home and export markets is down over recent years. There is nothing more sensitive for that industry than European harmonisation and excise duty. I thought that that was well known to everyone who operates in Scottish politics. From private conversations, I know that there was blank astonishment in the industry that the Government were about to do a deal in Europe which built in the advantage of zero rating for wine, but enforced a minimum level of excise duty that badly undermined whisky's competitiveness in the vital southern European markets. As I understand it, that was discovered only 48 hours before the deal was to be completed. On a Sunday night, an emergency meeting was held at the Chancellor of the Exchequer's home, at which the Chancellor uttered what may become an immortal phrase when he said, "Why didn't you tell me about this?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are entitled to ask the Government and the Scottish Office what on earth is happening. This is a fundamental matter for the Scottish economy, so why does the Chancellor have to ask why he was not told about it? The industry responded, "We've been shouting from the rooftops at every conceivable and possible opportunity." Did the Secretary of State know that the deal was about to be concluded? If not, why not? If he did know, why did he not stop it? Why did this have to involve a chance discovery by the industry and an emergency meeting on a Sunday night? Why did the Scottish Office try to sit this out? Why was it absent without leave when it was most needed? I should be happy to give way to the Secretary of State so that he can give the Committee an explanation and, if necessary, an account of what is happening. [HON. MEMBERS: "Come on."] The Secretary of State sits it out. Clearly, there has been a breakdown in communication between the Secretary of State and the Treasury that has prejudiced Scotland's interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The anxiety sparked by that breakdown is also a feature of the argument over the future of the Rosyth naval base, which has important consequences for the economy not only of Dunfermline and Fife, but of the whole of Scotland. The withdrawal of thousands more naval personnel would put thousands of jobs at risk and badly affect the markets for local businesses. Once again, so far as one can discover, there was a conspiracy to prejudge the issue: Rosyth was to go and no other option was to be examined. To use a military metaphor, there was a pre-emptive strike. The Scottish Office was sidelined and was to have been told about the plan only when the mission of destruction had been accomplished. I hope that the Secretary of State—or, perhaps, the Under-Secretary of State when he comes to reply to the debate—will say
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
something about the matter. The Scottish Office should be extremely grateful that the conspiracy spilt into the public domain. The display of public indignation blocked immediate progress with the plan, as did the superb campaign which had the work force at its heart. That was good for the Scottish Office, which otherwise would have been swept along. The wrong decision would have been taken without scrutiny or debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is happening now? We understand that there was a naval board recommendation for closure of the base. Has that recommendation been overturned? Is Vice-Admiral Livesay's plan to save the base but make economies a runner? 	<i>Scotland on Sunday</i> told us at the weekend that the Secretary of State was meeting the Secretary of State for Defence and that the Prime Minister had decided that there would be no closure "before the general election"—an important qualification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The House is full of rumours. Apparently, there are planted questions on the Order Paper, but the Secretary of State now has an opportunity to tell us something of his role. I warn him that we expect him to deliver because of the importance of Rosyth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an interview with Keith Aitken in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> of 4 July, the Under-Secretary of State, who has responsibility for Scottish Industry, said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"there are situations when the Scottish Office has to know what is happening and liaise with Whitehall—an example of that would be Rosyth."</p></blockquote>
It is extraordinary that we have to be told by a Minister that there are occasions when the Scottish Office has to know what is happening. I hope that it knows what is happening in connection with Rosyth, and that the Secretary of State can tell the Committee something helpful about the matter. I shall give way to him in a moment if he so wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The test of any announcement, whether it is made today or next week, is that it should ensure a genuine and secure future for the base. It should also ensure that the base has a role to play in the strategic shape of Britain's defence effort. There must be no suggestion that we are shuffling off an awkward question with a few cosmetic changes until the general election has been held, only to review it if the Government stagger home. 	<i>Scotland on Sunday</i> stated that the Prime Minister had decreed that no closure would happen, at least in the run-up to the general election. It would be helpful if the Secretary of State could make it clear that he is not only fighting, but winning the battle to save the base, so that it will have the future that we in the Opposition wish for it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take seriously the breakdown in communication that has occurred about the whisky industry, about Rosyth and many other issues. The Secretary of State increasingly resembles a cipher in British politics and a policeman in Scottish politics. That is bad for his office and for all of us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not have time to deal with Lanarkshire in detail, but I shall mention it briefly. The campaign for the steel industry will obviously continue. The Secretary of State made a point about building the Lanarkshire economy. In the past half hour, he has compounded what was already an unsatisfactory predicament. Lanarkshire has been subjected to a mosaic of Budget handouts, grants and additional payments. The Under-Secretary calculated the total at £120 million when he spoke in the Chamber on 4 July. That reference can be found in col. 501 in Vol. 194 of the 	<i>Official Report.</i> The figure, which sounds so impressive, includes the budget of the Lanarkshire development agency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed. The Minister gave the impression that £120 million had been found. The figure was actually much lower. I take the point that the Under-Secretary made when he said that the proper figure was £29 million. If that is the figure, it is inadequate. To pray in aid a redevelopment of Hairmyres or a general hospital at Wishaw, which was needed and campaigned for 26 years ago, is near dishonest. The Secretary of State implied that there would be nothing for local authorities this year and that any Government-funded contribution would be made in 1992–93 at the earliest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary should comment on site clearance and contamination subsidence. What about the "polluter pays" principle, which was included in the Government's White Paper? British Steel is a polluter. If British Steel abandons sites, it will be unsatisfactory if only a cosmetic clear-up is made and the public purse is left to pay what has been estimated at £50 million or £100 million in bills before the sites can be used. That will knock a hell of a hole in any budget that the Government provide and will make a mockery of figures, such as £29 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The crisis affects other countries, but it has been compounded in Scotland by Government policy. I shall watch the Leyland Daff Albion plant in my constituency closely. It employs fewer than 500 people and there have been 95 redundancies in recent months. In the past two years the van and truck market in the United Kingdom has declined by 60 per cent.—it has declined by between 30 and 35 per cent. in the past year—yet in Europe, the decline is 4 to 5 per cent. and the German market has actually expanded. That must puzzle the Secretary of State, because Germany has a minimum wage policy. Why is it doing so well? Why is nature standing on its head? Why is the Secretary of State so prejudiced and so wrong when he examines such issues?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
The Government are culpable because, in the terms of their statement in the Scottish Economic Bulletin, 10 to 12 years of Conservative Government have left Scotland at the bottom of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development league table. Of course we welcome the interest cut of 0·5 per cent., but the gap between the real cost of money and inflation is still high, and it is a gap that many companies cannot bridge. We want to see more support for manufacturing investment, capital allowances, links between business and education, technology trusts and tax credits for research and development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The special employment measures that have been announced are an apology and a joke when measured against the crisis that we face. The Secretary of State said in his press release that employment action would be "a huge boost" that will
	<br><blockquote><p>"help us to get on top of the recent rises in unemployment."</p></blockquote>
There were only 8,000 places; there are 220,000 Scots in the dole queue, and there will be 250,000 later in the year. The infrastructure links and the channel tunnel have been ignored. It seems that Scottish Enterprise has been shackled and has got off in the wrong way in its new career.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State says that Locate in Scotland has been a success. I read the report in the press this week that the planned overseas investment in Scotland in the previous year was £853 million, but, in the year reported on, it was to be £394 million. The figure has been more than halved, yet the Secretary of State blandly tells us that the campaign has been a success. I notice that the 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> reported that the Minister said that it had been "a notable year", but when pressed he agreed that "notable" meant difficult. That is a splendid example of Scottish Office newspeak. At least I like the Minister's honesty. He may on occasions sound a little bit of a buffoon, but at least he sometimes lapses into honesty. The Secretary of State should take a leaf from that book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need a new direction. We have tried the old ways and, for half a hundred reasons, we need a new Government. I was interested in what the Secretary of State said about GDP because that was in my mind. He said that the GDP in Scotland had gone up under the Conservative Government. I have an answer to a parliamentary question from my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) which came on 25 June. It gives Scotland's share of GDP per head relative to the United Kingdom. At the moment, it is lower than at any time since records were kept on a consistent basis—it is lower than at any time since 1971. For the Secretary of State to turn up here and talk about our good performance in terms of GDP per head when we are falling consistently further behind the rest of the country seems to tell us all that we know about the standards of argument that are being used in the Scottish Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other day Cambridge Econometrics produced a report. By any standards, it is a high-powered and respected organisation. It said that the north-south divide was now a permanent feature of the economic landscape, and that when growth comes to the United Kingdom economy, that it will come fast in the north, the midlands and Wales. Only two areas of the United Kingdom are picked out as areas that will fall further behind: Scotland and Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is the shape of the future, we have every reason to be worried. It need not be so. It will not be easy to put right or to undo the damage that has been done—it will be

	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
a long haul requiring commitment and a Government in partnership with business and the community, but the opportunity will come soon to make the change. It is absolutely vital for Scotland that that opportunity is grasped.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Salmond 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Banff and Buchan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been watching the Secretary of State for the past few minutes and he has looked a picture of misery, as well he might after giving such an indifferent performance today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State said that he had done his "very best" for the Scottish steel industry. Certainly, the public posture on the steel industry was supportive but what was the private posture? I want to question the Secretary of State about whether he went to the 4 June meeting with the chairman of British Steel, Robert Scholey, with a brief anticipating the closure of the Dalzell plate mill. The Secretary of State is reported to have said to Robert Scholey:
	<br><blockquote><p>"You know my view that the management of British Steel is entirely a matter for you subject of course to competition law."</p></blockquote>
The Committee is entitled to know whether that was said to Robert Scholey at the meeting on 4 June 1991. Was Robert Scholey told at that meeting that the management of British Steel was entirely a matter for its chairman? Will the Secretary of State confirm or deny that he expressed that opinion, in private, to Robert Scholey at that meeting? If the Secretary of State does not intervene, his silence will speak volumes for his private opinion, while his public posture has been to support the shop stewards and the Dalzell workers. That does not even equal the effort put in by his predecessor this time last year. When the announcement of the closure of the strip mill was made, his predecessor, the right hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind), told the House that he would question British Steel's figures. He said that he would analyse the financial basis of the decision to close the mill and that, if the decision proved to be incorrect, he would forcefully argue Scotland's corner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In contrast, the present Secretary of State has shown, at best, total and immediate capitulation to the decision of the company without making any effort to question further the company's analysis of the position. He has made no effort to question the economics of the company's decision, despite the fact that the Scottish Office has publicly argued that the Dalzell plate mill is by far the best option for the company. Shall we hear nothing about the facts and no arguments on behalf of the steel workers at Dalzell? Has the Secretary of State surrendered all possibility of changing the company's mind and of locating that strategic plate mill investment in Scotland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, the Secretary of State's silence on those matters speaks volumes. His speech showed that he accepted that the Scottish steel industry had gone for ever. He made a fundamental mistake when he tried to argue that, although the closure of the steel industry may be a set back or a tragedy for Lanarkshire, it was not important to the overall balance of the Scottish economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many members of the Committee believe that the steel industry lies at the heart of the Scottish economy. For proof that the Secretary of State is isolated in his opinion, we need look no further than an article in Sunday's edition
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
of 	<i>Scotland on Sunday,</i> entitled "Business View. It said that 56 per cent. of 150 business men interviewed in a sample supplied by the Institute of Directors—a sample in which the Secretary of State should have confidence—wanted the Government to intervene in the affairs of British Steel to release Scottish assets and to sell them to a bidder who would run them properly as opposed to running them into the ground. So 56 per cent. of company directors in Scotland want to see the Government intervention, which the Secretary of State, through his silence, is obviously unwilling and unable to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The survey further asked the same sample of directors what impact the closure of the Dalzell plate mill would have on their own businesses. No less than 29 per cent.—almost a third—said that their businesses would be affected by the closure of the steel industry in Scotland. Therefore, the issue affects not only Lanarkshire, but a wide range of businesses across the country. If the Secretary of State had been listening to the debates about the steel industry that have gone on for the past few years he would be aware of the anxiety of many hon. Members about the impact and the ripple effect of that closure on the Clyde Ports authority, on Scottish Power's sales and on British Rail in Scotland. He would also know that every steel user in Scotland will have reasons to be anxious that the demise of the Scottish steel industry, which has been accepted so meekly by the right hon. Gentleman, will result in unfavourable pricing policies by British Steel, which will increase the cost to every steel user in Scotland. That is why almost a third of company directors in Scotland realise that when the decision is made by British Steel, it will have a detrimental impact on their businesses. That is why a clear majority of that sample want intervention by the Government and the Secretary of State for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State totally misjudged the position of Scotland relative to the growing industrial infrastructure of the Teesside economy. This time last year there was considerable controversy about the central North sea gathering system and the decision by the Amoco-led consortium to pipe gas direct from offshore Aberdeen to the Teesside economy. In answer to my parliamentary questions, the Secretary of State said that he welcomed the development of gas going straight from the central North sea into the Teesside economy. Perhaps he should reflect on the CBI booklet published this month entitled 	<i>CBI News.</i> It contains a 14-page survey on the build-up of industrial development in Teesside and illustrates the interlinks between the investments in steel and in cheap gas and electricity generation in the Teesside economy. It was said with considerable force that lower fuel costs are set to attract many new companies, engaged in a range of activities, to that region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to repeat the argument that I advanced last year. That growing industrial infrastructure in the Teesside economy will, if things are left alone out-compete many of the key elements of the Scottish industrial base. That will not happen by accident, or as a result of the free market, but because a specific Government subsidy allows that Amoco-led consortium to pipe gas from the central North sea, 250 miles to the Teesside economy. Has the Scottish Office analysed the figures? Can the Secretary of State confirm, or deny, that the subsidy given to that consortium of oil companies will be no less than between £150 million and £170 million to take that gas the double distance to Teesside from offshore Aberdeen?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0377">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
Will Scotland become the first country in history to pay international oil companies to take away our most valuable natural resources to power an industrial complex that will out-compete many of the central Scotland industries? Will the Secretary of State tell us what he is doing, if anything, about that or at least tell us whether the subsidy of £150 million is going into the coffers of the Amoco-led consortium?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year in our debate we had a long exchange about the relative position of Scotland in the United Kingdom economy. The argument from the former Secretary of State was that there was a recession, but that Scotland was emerging from it far better than any other part of the United Kingdom. His argument was clear. Scotland was surviving the recession and would emerge stronger. He argued that this was the first recession in which Scotland was doing better than other parts of the United Kingdom. What a ridiculous argument. Already this morning we have heard that most of the economic indicators—the production industry, manufacturing and construction—show that the decline in Scotland last year was three times as great as that in the United Kingdom as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year, many of us argued that as the recession moved on to investment-good production, Scotland would suffer severely and so it has proved. During 1990 the investment production index for Scotland fell by 32·9 points on the index. That fall is unprecedented in the recorded progress of that index which includes the time, 10 years ago, when the investment-goods production in Scotland fell so far and so far in such a short period. That renders unbelievable the total and utter complacency from the Scottish Office team who are still living in the make-believe world where Scotland is doing better than the rest of the United Kingdom when every available indicator shows otherwise. The Scottish recession is hitting hard and in many of the basic industries it is hitting harder than elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, I mentioned the survey of business men in the Scottish economy. I have noticed that, in Committee, the Secretary of State is fond of quoting business surveys. He says that they show that the people who take decisions about the Scottish economy are firmly behind the Government's policies. If the Secretary of State looked in detail at the survey in Sunday's edition of 	<i>Scotland on Sunday,</i> he would find a different story. It shows that 58 per cent. of Scotland's business leaders reject the suggestion that Scotland is over-subsidised relative to other parts of the United Kingdom. A central part of Tory propaganda in Scotland is not believed by 150 directors of Scottish companies because 57 per cent. believe that the United Kingdom's economic policy is, in fact, a regional policy for London and the south-east. Scotland has been led into a totally unnecessary recession in the past few years by a high-interest-rate policy that was designed to cool an economy that was not over-heating. Scotland's business leaders appreciate the cost of being part of the United Kingdom's economic policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only 26 per cent. of those questioned believe that British Governments have used the £100,000 million from Scottish oil revenues in the best interest of the Scottish economy. Some 88 per cent. believe that the rates differential between Scotland and England hinders Government investment, and most believe that the Government are not doing enough to reduce that differential. Of those questioned, 86 per cent. think that
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
Scotland's transportation links with Europe are insufficient to take advantage of 1992 and the opening of the channel tunnel. Scotland's business leaders now realise that the previous Secretary of State for Scotland has spent 10 times more money in the past few months, as Secretary of State for Transport, on improving the transportation infrastructure in the south-east of England than he did in several years as Secretary of State for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only 32 per cent. think that the Government is fighting in the European Community for Scotland's vital interests, such as steel or fishing. I suspect that that percentage will be even lower after what the Secretary of State said this morning about the performance of the whisky industry. A majority support the argument for a Scottish oil fund, which would give Scotland some benefit in the next 20 years from the resources off its shores. That contrasts with the zero revenue that we have received in the past 20 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State was correct to say that oil was a new industry that offered tremendous prospects. A paper that was released from Aberdeen university this month shows that North sea oil and gas production will reach a new peak at the end of the century and hit another peak between 2005 and 2006. North sea oil and gas production still has a long way to go. In the past 12 years, the first £100,000 million from Scottish oil disappeared down the Swanee into the Government's coffers. The question for Scotland is what will happen to the next £100,000 million? Will it be used to benefit the Scottish economy or will it be wasted in bankrolling the mistaken economic policies of a Conservative Government?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I promise to be brief, and I shall be. This morning it became clear that the Secretary of State has no solutions to the economic problems of our country, and that he is not even aware of the extent of those problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I congratulate the hon.

The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) made some interesting points about Rosyth. If there is a peace dividend, there would inevitably be a reduction in military capability.

I have consistently argued that the Rosyth base has a strategic importance that requires it to be kept open.

I join the hon. Member for Garscadden in congratulating the shop stewards and trade unions at Rosyth. They have conducted an impeccable campaign and they are to be congratulated on the way in which they have won hearts and minds across the political spectrum.

The Scottish regiments are important to the Scottish economy because they provide jobs for many young Scots. Their importance to Scotland and to its economy cannot be underestimated. In the British Army recruitment to, and retention of the the regiments is second to none. When

It will surprise no one that I wish to mention whisky. Because we are members of the European Community, there will be constant, inevitable pressure and demands on our various indigenous industries. I am grateful to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and his ministerial colleagues for the interest that they have taken in the whisky industry and in raspberry growers, with whom my right hon. Friend has been in contact recently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no question but that under the so-called harmonising that is so popular with Liberal Democrats and others, we shall be called upon to protect the interests of our indigenous industries. It is important, when considering harmonisation, to examine most carefully any policy that gives preferential treatment to European industries that compete with ours. In the past the wine industry has enjoyed massive support from the Governments of countries that produce it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not harmonised on the alcohol content in drink, for which the Scotch whisky industry has asked and argued. Until that is done, we must examine constantly the small print to judge its effect on wine and beer as well as on whisky. The whisky industry, with its £1,700 million-worth of exports last year, is still Scotland's most important manufacturing industry. If we look after it, it will look after us. It is important to consider Scotland's economic position relative to the rest of the United Kingdom and, indeed, to the rest of the world. Anyone who thinks that the recession is home-grown has not studied the position in Canada, New Zealand and Australia—in each case it is much worse than that in Scotland. The state of the economy in the United States was worse than that in Scotland for a time, but it is beginning to recover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I intervened in the speech of the hon. Member for Garscadden, because I believe that the most important aspects of competition in this modern world are productivity and unit-labour costs. They are what matter when we try to sell into foreign markets. There is no doubt that the productivity of Britain's manufacturing industry and our relative unit-labour costs have improved dramatically in the past 10 years. Anyone who disagrees with that has not attempted to study the facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the fact that the Scottish economy grew by an average of 2·9 per cent. each year between 1983 and 1989. I note also that under Labour, it grew by less than 1 per cent. each year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We could bandy about figures all the time. What we cannot bandy about is the fact that Scottish people who are in work are also much better off today than they were 10 or 12 years ago. Anyone who had forecast during the 1979 election campaign that we would increase take-home pay for everyone in work by one third would have been accused of electioneering. However, that is what has happened. That is especially marked in the public sector, where doctors, dentists, nurses and others have enjoyed massive pay increases—as opposed to the substantial decreases in take-home pay that they suffered under the previous Labour Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Let me make it clear that we should rather have the jobs than lose them.

The number of self-employed people, whom the hon. Member for Garscadden seemed to think should not be included, rose by 57 per cent. between 1981 and 1990 to a figure of 234,000, compared with no growth in the previous three decades.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the long-term, the changes that have taken place will, I believe, be beneficial to Scotland and to the Scottish economy. I accept that we are going through a period of difficulty—anyone who thinks that we are not, is not living in the real world. When we come out of that period of difficulty—and we will and we are slowly beginning to do so—the companies that remain will be leaner, fitter and more competitive. Their productivity and their unit-labour costs will be competitive. The best guarantee for jobs in the future is to provide the products and services that people want, at prices that they are prepared to pay. It is critical that productivity and unit-labour costs in Scotland remain competitive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Eadie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Midlothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Secretary of State introduced the debate, he denied any charge that there was complacency in his Department. As we have listened to this debate, it has become clear that additional charge should be made against the Secretary of State and his Administration: not only is there complacency but indifference. To some extent, I shall seek to substantiate that charge. I hope that the Committee will bear with me when I discuss primarily constituency matters, but they are important to my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers will not be unaware of the fact that for some considerable time I have pressed the case about the Easthouses-Mayfield area being incorporated in the urban aid programme. I received a letter from the secretary of the the Lothian regional council a fortnight ago. To some extent the letter was disappointing because it said that the decision about how to deal with the question of urban aid would be delayed until after the 1991 census has been analysed. Therefore, the decision is likely to be taken in about 1992. I refer to that matter because I believe that it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0379">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
was my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) who made the charge that the Government seem determined to delay all decisions until after the next general election. The letter from the Scottish office to Lothian regional council essentially means that no decision will be taken until after the election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I exempt the present Secretary of Sttae from that charge. However, I do not exempt him from another charge. Lothian regional council produced a document dealing with urban aid; all the district councils were involved in drawing it up and it was agreed at that meeting that I should ask the Secretary of State for Scotland for a meeting to discuss it. In my parliamentary experience, when an hon. Member asks for a meeting with the appropriate Minister, it is granted. The most dramatic change that the present Administration have introduced is that they refuse to meet hon. Members. I got a reply from the then Secretary of State saying that it would not be advisable to have a meeting about urban aid. That happened two years ago. We have been discussing the issue for some time. I find the attitude of the Scottish office very puzzling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can speak with authority, because when I was a Minister in a Labour Government, I never refused hon. Members the opportunity to meet me. That does not mean that I acquiesced to all that they said. I am not saying that I was able to resolve the problems. I am an old-fashioned parliamentarian. I believe that it is common courtesy for Ministers to grant a meeting to an hon. Member to discuss a problem in that hon. Member's constituency. A former Secretary of State, with whom I sought, and was granted, a meeting, ordered all the civil servants out of the room when we met, saying, "Alex and I will discuss the problem together." One could not imagine those in the present Administration, or any of the previous Secretaries of State in Conservative Governments, taking that attitude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In contradiction of what I have said, I was grateful to the Parliamentary Under-Secretary who is responsible for industry for agreeing not to meet Lothian's regional council, he refused to do so, but to meet Midlothian district council to discuss RECHAR and other problems. I thank him for the courtesy that he extended to me and to Midlothian district council. We went into great detail, but I shall use shorthand. RECHAR was drafted by the Coalfield Communities Campaign, an organisation that comprises all United Kingdom coalfield local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument is based on additionality. In short, there is EC money available now for mining communities that have suffered drastically as a result of the contradiction of the coal industry. My own constituency has suffered severly because of that. However, the money cannot become available unless we resolve the problem of additionality. The EC is prepared to give the money, but it must be on a quid pro quo basis. The Government do not propose to avail themselves of the money, because they do not agree with the process of additionality. The EC says that it will not plough money in for it to become buried in the Treasury and for the Government to use it only for the schemes that they think fit. The money is allocated for areas that have suffered as a result of the contraction of the mining industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister wrote to me. In that letter he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The likelihood of EC receipts is one of many factors which will be taken into account in determining capital allocations. As I suggested at our meeting, the Council would
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
be well advised to identify in their forthcoming financial plan any schemes which are likely to benefit from RECHAR and other EC programmes."</p></blockquote>
That is rather puzzling because at that meeting Midlothian district council submitted its schemes to the Minister. I felt that that letter was somewhat gratuitous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I even have a letter dated 28 November 1989 from the then Secretary of State, the right hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind) about RECHAR and the document "Why include Midlothain?".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is reassuring that you were given the impression that there is also support for Midlothian within the Commission, and I hope that there will be a successful outcome."</p></blockquote>
That was two years ago. I am puzzled by the Minister's attitude, so perhaps he will clarify the matter. I put a question to the Secretary of State for Employment and I mentioned additionality and the RECHAR programme. He said that the Government have no intention at the moment of implementing that. One arm of the Government does not know what the other arm is doing. I hope that when the Parliamentary Under-Secretary replies he will comment on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final subject that I want to raise is the reopening of Monktonhall colliery, which fits the allegation that I made in my introductory remarks about the complacency and indifference shown by the Secretary of State and the Scottish Office. The Committee should be aware that the present colliery is mothballed. My attitude has not been popular with some hon. Members. I said that my trade union had an agreement with British Coal that the mothballing would last until June when the situation would be reappraised. I never hid the fact that I wanted British Coal to reopen the colliery. I am disturbed that, judging from what some hon. members have said, they would prefer the colliery to close.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A fortnight ago, I had a meeting with the chairman of British Coal; I happen to be the secretary of the miners' parliamentary group. Indeed, I have had many meetings about the reopening of Monktonhall. Good reserves are available in the colliery. In the admirable debate that was initiated by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Strang) that matter was dealt with in greater detail than I have time to today. A substantial case was made for the long-term future of Monktonhall colliery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are 40 million tonnes of reserves available. Investment has been made to examine the seams. It is difficult to understand the attitude of the Scottish Office. I asked the Secretary of State for a meeting to discuss this matter. The Scottish Trades Union Congress wrote to the Secretary of State for Scotland and asked for a meeting. When I put an oral question to the Secretary of State, the Minister responsible for industry, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) replied and said that a meeting would be held. I was appalled and flabbergasted because I took the precaution of writing to the general secretary of the STUC and he said that there was not going to be a meeting. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I must say I think it is particularly ironic that the Scottish Office refuses to lend its weight to the Monktonhall campaign, whilst Heathcoat-Amory, at the Department of Energy, is prepared to write directly to British Coal seeking an early decision. In the light of this, I have written once again (for the third time) to Ian Lang today requesting yet again that he agrees to meet a delegation."</p></blockquote>
I cannot understand the Secretary of State's attitude on this subject; as I see it, he refuses to meet as important a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0380">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
body as the STUC or to comment on or help with Monktonhall. Yet one of the Ministers at the Department of Energy has decided to write to the chairman of British Coal about reopening the colliery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, the Select Committee on Energy, having taken evidence on the matter, also wrote to the chairman of British Coal about reopening the colliery. But where does the Secretary of State for Scotand stand? He is the custodian of industry and employment in Scotland, and for that reason I make the charge that the right hon. Gentleman is not only complacent but indifferent to the question. It is, to some extent, a scandal, that in my constituency the chance of 400 jobs in an area that is job hungry—an area that has been greatly deprived by the contraction of mining and other industries—is being ignored. The Secretary of State remains frozen, sitting on his hands, and refuses to speak up on a Scottish issue. This looks like a rerun of what happened to British Steel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish Office Ministers seem to think more of their next press releases than of doing something about what is happening in Scotland. Their aggressive approach lies in frightening our children, telling them that the bogey man will get them if another Labour Government are elected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most frightening prospect for the Scottish people, Mr. Martin, is the return of another Tory Government. I believe that the people of Scotland, and of the whole United Kingdom, have already made their decision: there ain't going to be another Tory Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again we have today heard the Secretary of State for Scotland apologising for the state of Scotland. Let me tell him that there are hundreds of thousands of the people in Scotland still in poverty after 12 years of miracles wrought by the Government. We have seen more than 200,000 people unemployed, yet the Government say that the recession is over. They have been telling us that for 10 years. While unemployment is raging, and poverty is plumbing the depths, the Minister and his cronies are wining and dining at the best places while ordinary people are eating fish suppers and buying clothes at second-hand shops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I plead with the Secretary of State to stop his Ministers coming to my constituency. Do you know, Mr. Martin, what happens every time they come? A Minister comes on a propaganda visit, but as sure as fate, the following week there is an announcement that a factory has closed and another 120 jobs have gone. Nearly every time a Minister honours my constituency with a visit, someone gets thrown on the dole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This week we are expecting a visit from the Minister of State, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth). I am sure that that is an honour. He is arriving at Glasgow airport, which is in my constituency. I hope that the Minister can make a short visit to Lawtex to tell the company that the recession has not hurt it, and how that recession is not causing 124 job losses. I shall take you, Minister, by the hand to meet the young people working at Lawtex who are desperate to continue to work there. I
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
am sure that the Minister and the Secretary of State would tell them that the recession is over and that we are now in a boom—some boom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ten years ago we saw the closure of the old Peugeot Talbot factory, which is where Lawtex is based, with the loss of 5,000 jobs. There were 9,500 people working at the Linwood car plant. What do we see 10 years on? In place of about 10,000 jobs some houses have been built and there is an ASDA shop. I am happy that something has happened, but the insult is that the Government have called that a phoenix rising from the ashes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only thing that our people really want is jobs. They have a right to work, to contribute to the economy and to make a genuine contribution to their life. I ask the Secretary of State not to forget that, when we speak of the economy, we are talking about ordinary men and women. We are talking about the young people languishing on the dole and elderly people who have to pay inflated prices because of the Government's decade of absolute decline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recently contacted the Secretary of State about a local enterprise company. Everyone in the House knows that I have been interested in training for a long time. Local enterprise companies are not a panacea but, at least, the Government are prepared to recognise that training, apprenticeships and so on play an important role in the economy. Lo and behold, Secretary of State, what did you do? The Government launched the scheme with a 33 per cent. cut in numbers, throwing 20,000 young trainees and 7,000 supervisors in Scotland onto the dole over night. Was that done to meet the challenges of the 1990s and to take Scotland into the new arena of combat in the world?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has told us that we are looking well, but he should come with me and I shall introduce him to young Pat Campbell, whom the Government threw on to the dole during his training as a plumber. I have mentioned that man on the Floor of the House and I shall mention him again today. The Pat Campbells of this world want to finish their apprenticeships and training. They want to be able to sit in a restaurant, to go on holiday, to buy clothes, to marry, to settle down and to have a family. The Government are denying people the right to finish even the miserable training that they have provided. The money that the Government provide for training is absolutely abysmal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have pleaded with Ministers in the House to release more money to ensure that every young man and woman serving time on a training scheme can finish it. That plea fell on deaf ears—nearly everything falls on deaf ears. Homelessness escalates, as does unemployment, yet the Government do nothing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Renfrewshire, we have been effected by the Government's absolutely useless policies. I noticed recently that Michael Hirst has a vested interest in the new stadium that will be built in Lanark, but I shall not say much about that. Renfrew district council wants a new stadium. I ask you, Secretary of State, to be fair to the people of Renfrew who have worked hard on plans for a stadium. Please give them a fair hearing and do not listen to a Tory hack who is trying to ensure that he pops into various areas. The Secretary of State should be aware that there will not be one Tory left in Scotland if he continues to listen to the Michael Hirsts of this world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has said that everything in the garden was rosy. The Fort Matilda tunnel, one of the oldest tunnels in Scotland, is over a mile long and serves Gourock and Argyll. The hon. Member for Argyll and

	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
Bute (Mrs. Michie) supports me in asking for that lifeline to Argyll to be kept open. We want the Government to get off their backsides and help take the stress and strain away from local government by providing the necessary finance to keep not merely one track but the whole tunnel open. That would help the economy of Inverclyde and Argyll, which in turn would be good for the whole of Scotland. I hope, Secretary of State, that you listen to what I am saying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member must be careful about how he uses the word "you".

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Martin. The Wemyss Bay station, which includes a grade A listed building, is one of the finest stations in the country. The local authority has been lumbered with caring for that building, yet it has been cash-starved by the Government. I agree with the Government's policy of listing buildings, but the local authority must now find £1·5 million to support that building. I ask the Secretary of State to take an active interest by providing that £1·5 million. The Government should ensure that our heritage is protected and historical sites, such as the Wemyss Bay station, are kept open. That appeal may seem strange when thousands of people are suffering from poverty and unemployment, but at least it would give someone a job. I appeal to the Secretary of State to listen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities are the best providers of services in their areas. However, the Government continue to starve them of cash, with the result that jobs go to the wall. The Government created the poll-tax fiasco, yet in the end local authorities have to pick up the tab. They have to find the money, and the Government do nothing to assist them.

Is the Secretary of State aware of what is happening in the country? Is he aware that the shipbuilding and marine engine company, Kvaerner, has almost closed? We no longer build engines in Scotland—a country famous for its engineering capacity and skills. The Secretary of State has sat back and allowed that industry to be sunk. Last year, my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, North (Mr. Adams) suffered the traumatic experience of seeing Howdens, another famous engine company, going to the wall. It was making a profit, but 500 jobs were scrapped—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I remember one battle that we won; the battle to keep the royal ordnance factory in Bishopton open. That battle was fought by the workers and they won. The local communities supported that fight. The Government had given up because they told us that it was a commercial decision, but we proved that the decision made by the company was wrong. We were delighted that the company agreed with us and that the royal ordnance factory at Bishopton continued to work and to employ people. Thank God that it did during the Gulf crisis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has continued a stupid nonsense that punishes local businesses in my constituency—the Erskine bridge tolls. The tolls continue to this day. Last year the maintenance costs of the bridge were £300,000. The tolls raised more than £2·3 million. Does the Secretary of State for Scotland realise where those millions of pounds come from? They come from the local businesses that are struggling in the deep recession and depression. The Government should abolish the Erskine bridge tolls and all toll bridges so that the local infrastructure and local businesses can compete effectively with the rest of Britain. If the Secretary of State does not do that, he is failing in his duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall quote from 	<i>The Scottish Business Insider</i>—not from 	<i>Labour Weekly</i> or 	<i>Tribune.</i> It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The fortunes of the UK construction industry have been turned upside down in the past couple of years. The boom of the late 1980s—now well and truly over—have given away to redundancies, short-time working and company failures among contractors and suppliers. Until recently Scottish construction companies were strenuously denying that the `southern' malaise was affecting them. Now their optimism seems severely dented. Whilst experiencing markedly different conditions than their English counterparts it looks as if the Scottish construction sector will not escape a similar fall."</p></blockquote>
I believe that the only way in which to save the Scottish economy from further deep malaise and depression is the return of a Labour Government who are committed to listening to people and to taking action. Only that action will enable the young Pat Campbells to finish their apprenticeships and to start working and manufacturing to improve the quality of life for all of us. We need the Pat Campbells of this world—we do not need the Tory Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I shall endeavour to make the essential points as quickly and forcefully as I can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My party is committed to the free-market economy. There should not be any equivocation about that. However, unlike the Conservative party, it recognises that the Government have a responsibility to ensure that the economy works and underpins the market's ability to flourish. The Secretary of State may wish to take credit for those areas of the economy that are doing well and not to take the blame for those that are not flourishing. He is not willing to accept the responsibility that the Government bear to invest in the infrastructure essential to the economy and to ensure that company law, competition policy and regional policy work effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the major issues for the Scottish economy are failures on the Government's part. The moment that the Government privatised British Steel as a single entity under the direction of Bob Scholey, the steel industry in Scotland was finished. The Government knew that at the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0382">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
time and could have acted to ensure that an independent Scottish steel industry was given a fighting chance. If the rundown of the steel industry is to continue, what the Government have so far announced for the economy of Lanarkshire and west central Scotland is inadequate. I hope that the Minister will accept the recommendations that I have made on behalf of my party for the establishment of a west of Scotland development corporation to attract substantial new investment to the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Midlothian (Mr. Eadie) referred to Monktonhall. I agree that the Government's inactivity in trying to secure the re-opening of that colliery is disgraceful. I have had many long conversations with the miners' co-operative and can testify that the secretary, George Laing, pointed out that British Coal had said that it would make an announcement before the end of June. No such announcement has been forthcoming. The Government's attitude has been that it is a matter for British Coal. British Coal is still owned by the Government. Ministers are responsible for it and accountable to the House. The Under-Secretary's refusal to meet hon. Members, answer questions or intervene to obtain a decision on the colliery is a dereliction of duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The possibility of the closure of Rosyth is a great anxiety to the Scottish economy. I agree with the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) that the strategic case is paramount. I represent a constituency in the north-east of Scotland and I am appalled that we could leave our oil and gas installations and our fishing industry in the North sea without an east coast base for their support and protection. It is incomprehensible that the base's closure is being mooted, given the importance of those activities to the Scottish and United Kingdom economies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must reinforce the intervention that I made on the Secretary of State about North sea oil and gas. He did not give me a satisfactory answer. As the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) said, the projections for activity rates in the North sea over the next few years are for a large increase in production, exploration and development and for immigration of many people into north-east Scotland to administer and service the industry. We cannot handle that unless the Government release extra resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many hon. Members would envy my constituency, which has the lowest unemployment rate of any parliamentary constituency in the United Kingdom—1·2 per cent. Hon. Members who represent constituencies with high rates of unemployment have real problems that require real resources. The Government should realise that full employment also brings problems. If people are to work, we must provide housing, drainage, roads and essential infrastructure. The free market does not provide that. The providers of such services are, fundamentally, local authorities and other Government and public agencies. They need capital consents to enable them to make the investment necessary to allow the expansion to take place. The Secretary of State should review the capital consents that are available. It is no coincidence that my constituency also had the largest increase in homelessness in Scotland because house prices are high and housing provision inadequate. However, the Scottish Homes
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
budget for the north of Scotland was cut more severely than that of any other region, despite housing demand there being the highest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should change their philosophy and approach if they are to secure the long-term success of the Scottish economy by creating Scottish-owned and controlled enterprises rather than by making Scotland a branch factory economy entirely dependent on outside and overseas investment. That is not to denigrate such investment, but Scotland is too dependent on it and we do not have enough indigenous industry. If privatisation had been carried out in a way that had secured Scottish control, if we had changed company law to provide tax incentives for and to encourage buy-outs, and if we had reversed competition policy to oblige bidders to prove that there would be benefits to the consumer, rather than the other way round, large sections of the Scottish economy that have gone out of Scottish control could have been secured. They could still be secured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I challenge the Government to recognise that one of the great successes of the establishment of a Scottish Parliament, which has been acknowledged by some business men in Scotland, is that it is likely to lead to an upsurge of indigenous enterprise. It will create an atmosphere in which people will want to invest in Scotland. The Government have failed to grasp the extent to which that new focus of attention in Scotland would create new enterprise and stimulate new investment. Unfortunately, it is beyond the Government's narrow horizons to see those intangible things—a spirit of enterprise, confidence and optimism—being brought about by the very things that the Government often say are great virtues. It would give the people of Scotland the confidence to take decisions for themselves. They should no longer have to rely on the Government to take the decisions that are necessary to ensure that the strength of the Scottish economy continues through the next 10 years.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All hon. Members listening to the Secretary of State opening the debate must have been reminded of the Chancellor of the Exchequer's attempts to talk up the British economy with his references to "vague stirrings". The Secretary of State seems to have adopted that policy towards Scotland. Rather than vague stirrings we heard mumbling apologies for the first 10 to 15 minutes of his speech as he tried to address the problems of Scotland. He only warmed to his job when he followed the example of the Prime Minister and all the other Secretaries of State who simply oppose rather than govern the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What was dramatic and disappointing about his speech was that he did not say a word about Rosyth. Whether or not there is a statement this afternoon, it is crucial for the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0383">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
Secretary of State to make clear his support for the continuing future of the Rosyth naval base. He did not say a single word about it on a day that is so critical for the 250 businesses concerned. The 13 years of solid achievement may be washed away today. The whole of Scotland must be disappointed by his silence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State made no mention of the general world economy and the impact it has on Scotland. Scotland relies heavily on capital goods. He said nothing about the G7 meeting that is taking place not far from this building. Yet it is clear that unless British Ministers want to create a climate of lower interest rates and unless there is a stimulus for investment in British industry the British economy, particularly the Scottish economy, will not recover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over 23,000 British businesses collapsed during the first six months of this year. In the same period last year 13,000 businesses collapsed. In Scotland 2,788 businesses collapsed in the first six months of last year and the figure rises dramatically to 4,081 for that period this year. That is an increase of 79·1 per cent. The Secretary of State was rather selective in his analysis of just how well the economy is doing. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) rightly drew the Committee's attention to the Cambridge Econometrics report, but he failed to mention the conclusion it drew. It makes the point that the slump has hit southern England hardest, but that that will change: the areas it describes as the periphery—Scotland and Northern Ireland—will be hardest hit as the recession continues. It also points out that Scotland is in a fairly unique position in terms of its remoteness from Europe. Unless some Government or EC policy is forthcoming, the impact of the recession in Scotland is likely to be increased.

The steel industry must also be extremely disappointed in what the Secretary of State said this morning. As my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden said two weeks ago, it is not that the Government have failed they have not even tried. The Department of Trade and Industry did nothing and said nothing because it was not invited to do either by the Secretary of State. Exactly the same might have happened with the whisky industry, had not the Chancellor of the Exchequer had his famous tipple in No. 11 and realised that he might lose it if he did not act. That lack of openness has permeated everything that the Secretary of State has said this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) noted that the optimism exhibited by the Secretary of State is not encountered in the chambers of commerce, the Confederation of British Industry, the Institute of Directors or in any serious analysis of the economy. The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) offered the daunting prospect of comparing the Scottish economy, and the British economy as a whole, with the economies of Australia and New Zealand. I thought that Britain was part of the Common Market and was in competition with the other G7 countries. The hon. Gentleman displayed anxiety for the soft fruit industry, but he might have shown a greater desire for the Scottish economy to compete more effectively with western and eastern European countries than with Australia and New Zealand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian (Mr. Eadie) made a succinct contribution. He has many years of experience at the coal face, both in the mines and, as a Minister, on the Front Bench. He drew attention to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
Secretary of State's absolute silence on Monktonhall. The reason for that silence was made clear by "World in Action"—the Scottish Office has no need to say anything because it listens in on all conversations anyway. I hope that when he replies the Under-Secretary of State will provide a more serious answer to the question of why the Secretary of State has been so silent on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is abundantly clear from this morning's proceedings is that the Government's only aim is to cure inflation using a narrow monetary policy. They have no wish to examine what the Scottish and British economies do best or to discover the physical, supply-side limits to economic capacity in terms of plant, machinery and skills which prevent our industry from matching supply with demand. The Government talk endlessly about inflation, but they do not seem to be bothered about the other half of the equation, which is the problem caused by there being too few goods. The Conservative party fails to understand that a country that can produce more of the goods that people want will have less difficulty in controlling the money chasing those goods. That is the real lesson to be learnt from Germany and Japan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State tried to suggest that, even though all the economic indicators show the opposite, the Government somehow are managing to out-perform the previous Labour Government. However, the Government's own half-yearly investment intentions survey published last week by the Central Statistical Office shows that manufacturing industry is expecting a 14 per cent. decline in investment this year and a meaningful recovery next year. That decline in investment—it took the Government from 1979 to 1988 even to reach the level of investment that they inherited from the previous Labour Government—cost Scotland £1,441 million. That money could have been invested in the manufacturing sector. That is why it is important that we keep on stating that investment in industry, plant, machinery, new technology and skills strengthens our economic capacity and is counter-inflationary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can pay our way in the world only if we can make the goods that the world wants to buy. Overwhelmingly, that means manufactured goods. For too long we have lacked a coherent strategy for the manufacturing industry. Industrial policy has been scorned and the Government have refused to acknowledge the crucial role that manufacturing plays in the British economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is exactly what we did not hear from the Secretary of State this morning. We may hear it from the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, but I rather think that we will simply hear more of the same. When the Secretary of State warmed to his task, he began to attack what he thought were the minuses of the Labour party proposals. We were given three examples, one of which was the national minimum wage. The Conservative party's attitude to a national minimum wage seems strange when, after all, it was Winston Churchill who established the wages councils. He said that without the protection of minimum wages, the good employer is undercut by the bad, and the bad employer by the worse. Time moves on, however, and the current Secretary of State for Employment says that wages councils do not have a permanent place in our system. Who does the minimum wage benefit? 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The Minister of State is again seeking to intervene from a sedentary position. My hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden spoke about real jobs and part-time jobs. About 4·5 million people would benefit
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0384">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
from a minimum wage, of whom 78 per cent. are women and 49 per cent. are female part-time workers. In addition, the Exchequer would gain about £1 billion through increased tax receipts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Spain, Portugal, France, the Netherlands and Luxembourg the minimum wage system does not have a serious impact on unemployment or create sudden surges in the wages spiral. Yet the Conservative party continually hypes up the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State for Employment initially said that 750,000 jobs would be lost. He then increased the figure, virtually overnight, to 1 million, and now he is talking about 2 million. On Friday, a ministerial reply said that 100,000 jobs in Scotland are under threat from Labour's minimum wage proposals. Where do the Government get the evidence for that statement? Independent academic research demonstrates that, in the worst-case scenario, 4,000 jobs might be lost after three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we look at the Scotland in which we must survive, we must consider what is happening in the outside world. The positive indicators are that unless the Government begin to invest in industry, take seriously the need to train our work force and deal with the contradiction highlighted in the newspapers at the weekend the grave disparity between the number of vacancies that exist in Scotland, the number of real jobs available and the number of Government training places—we will continue to slide down the performance scale in terms of the G7 group and other countries in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one area in which the Government seem able to answer those who demand even more. They say that if the economy is to function better, there should be a reduced dependence on welfare benefits. If there is one thing that the Government know about, it is reduced benefit. Breaking the link between pensions and earnings saved more than £25 billion, freezing child benefit saved £1 billion and, each year, cuts in benefits to the unemployed have saved a further £1 billion. That money was not used for manufacturing investment, but to give tax hand outs to the rich, which did not help the Scottish or British economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Monklands, East (Mr. Smith) said in a recent speech at the London school of economics, that the Conservative party
	<br><blockquote><p>"are stumbling backwards to the next election desperately hoping that a temporary up-turn in the boom and bust cycle of Tory economics will restore their political fortunes."</p></blockquote>
Every decision taken by the Government—the date of the next election or the next cut in interest rates—is made purely for political advantage and to avoid defeat at the next general election. Defeat will not be avoided. The only problem for Scotland is that the election may come too late.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I congratulate the hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) on his appearance on the Front Bench? It makes a pleasant change. However, I was surprised, as he comes from Dundee, that he did not commend the leader of his party who recently said at the conference of the Transport and General Workers Union that that union is the Labour party in so many ways. They remember that in Dundee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
I shall come to the point made by the hon. Member for Dundee, West on the minimum wage policy in a moment. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) did not refer to that policy—he referred to no Labour party policies. The hon. Members for Midlothian (Mr. Eadie) and for Renfrew, West and Inverclyde (Mr. Graham) raised several detailed points. I hope to have time to respond to them, but, if not, I shall write to the hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can reassure the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce), who advocated a spirit of enterprise, that the number of self-employed in Scotland has increased by some 60 per cent.—by some 234,000—since 1981. There is no better evidence of a spirit of enterprise than that. I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman's speech was truncated because of time. If he wishes to discuss some of the constituency matters to which he referred, my hon. Friends and I shall be glad to meet him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to deal with two general issues that were raised during the debate. First, the hon. Member for Garscadden and my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker), whose expertise in the whisky industry is recognised by all sides of the House, raised the question of the European Community harmonisation of excise duties. I emphasise that no agreement has been reached on minimum rates of duty for wines or spirits. At the recent meeting, the United Kingdom argued with the greatest determination that the proposals on the table for the recent negotiations—a nil or minimal rate for wines but a minimum for spirits, which would require the southern states to raise their spirits duties—would unacceptably increase the current discrimination against spirits. There is no question about the United Kingdom Government's position on that. The position now is that the EC will produce a report covering possible distortions in the drinks market. The minimum rate of spirits duty will be decided on the basis of that report. We shall ensure that the report is an objective analysis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second general question of great importance to the Scottish economy is the Rosyth naval base. For a long time, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and his officials have been in continuous contact and held discussions with the Ministry of Defence. The hon. Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown) has met my right hon. Friend and myself with delegations. The hon. Member for Dunfermline, West (Mr. Douglas) also came to the Scottish Office. I have also met shop stewards separately. The issue is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I join my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North in paying a tribute to the work force who have consistently put forward a reasoned, responsible and impressive case. The Prime Minister has repeatedly assured the House that the economic and employment implications will be fully taken into account before a decision on the Rosyth naval base is reached and announced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The whole of Scotland is waiting with bated breath for the decision and announcement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All I can say is that the decision will be announced shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, West asked me for evidence of the effect on unemployment of a statutory national minimum wage. The hon. Gentleman does not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0385">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
need to look to me for that evidence. Goldman Sachs has analysed part I of his party's proposals and estimated an annual loss to the gross domestic product of 0·5 per cent.; the National Institute of Economic and Social Research estimated a loss of 0·6 per cent.; James Capel, a loss of 0·5 per cent.; the Nomura Institute, a loss of 0·5 per cent.; the university of London, a loss of 2·5 per cent. and Phillips' and Drew has estimated a loss of 1·25 million jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to European countries. It is not true that Germany has a statutory national minimum wage. Germany has collective bargaining agreements, which can include a minimum wage and which are legally enforceable. Those agreements usually contain no-strike agreements. If that is what the Labour party recommend as a model for British collective bargaining, that is a positive step forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also referred to France. However, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said about France:
	<br><blockquote><p>"France's unemployment record compares unfavourably with that elsewhere … the problem is substantially more severe for youths, older workers and the unskilled … the national minimum wage seems in part to be responsible for this outcome".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister, at least—I hope that it also goes for his colleagues—has given up misquoting the Fabian society pamphlet, which clearly demonstrates the need for a minimum wage and the society's support for it. Those distortions were out of order. Instead of repeatedly carping about Labour's policy, will the Minsiter say what he proposes to do about people who suffer on low pay?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have helped them through family credit, expenditure on which has increased to £543 million under the Government. If the hon. Lady does not believe me, will she believe Gavin Laird who said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It's never worked in the past, there's no logic for it, it doesn't work in any other country and it certainly will not work in Great Britain"?</p></blockquote>
Will she believe Eric Hammond of the Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union, who said that the policy was so
	<br><blockquote><p>"fundamentally wrong that it will increasingly threaten Labour's prospects of a national victory"?</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
Will the hon. Lady heed Joe Haines of the 	<i>Daily Mirror?</i> Probably not, but she should heed Walter Eltis, director general of the National Economic Development Office who said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"My concern is that the whole money wages structure will go up …Britain's competitiveness in the ERM will weaken".</p></blockquote>
Independent commentator after independent commentator has made it clear that that policy would be a disaster and would impact precisely on those whom it is designed to help. The Labour party cannot deny that every independent commentator has made it clear that a national minimum wage polcy would cost jobs—the only question is how many.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his analysis of the Scottish economy the hon. Member for Garscadden tried to suggest that all was doom and gloom. There is no doubt, as my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) emphasised, that in the years since 1986—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Has the Minister mentioned the steel industry once in his summing-up?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not mentioned the steel industry yet. If the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) wishes to know our views on the steel industry, I refer him to the speech that I made on the Floor of the House last week when, among other allegations, he made an outrageous allegation against me which he refused to withdraw. I stand by what I said to the House last week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a huge number of general and specific points that I have not been able to cover in the short time available. The Scottish economy has gone through a period of successful major restructuring 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> It has been an exceptional period of economic growth. Output has gone up by nearly 12 per cent. in the three years to 1989. All forecasters suggest that we are getting through the recession extremely well.
