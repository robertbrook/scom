Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (Codes of Practice) (No. 2) Order 1990</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Peter Lloyd)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (Codes of Practice) (No. 2) Order 1990.</p></blockquote>
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, in accordance with section 67(7) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, may, from time to time, revise any codes of practice issued under that Act. He is required to lay any such revised codes before Parliament for its approval and to bring them into force by statutory instrument.<br><br>
You have, Mr. Hill, chaired a number of Committees in which I have spoken on behalf of the Government. You therefore know that I try to be brief to allow time for questions from members of the Committee. However, this is a complex matter, which is of great public interest and importance. It would therefore be useful if I explained the changes being made to particular codes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Denton and Reddish)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intervene to apologise on behalf of my hon. Friends on the Opposition Front Bench who are in difficulty because they are supposed to be serving on this Committee and on that considering the Criminal Justice Bill. When my hon. Friend the Member for Huddersfield (Mr. Sheerman) has moved his amendment to that Bill, he will return to this Committee to speak. He means no discourtesy, but it is impossible to be in two places at once.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I understand the position. Sometimes one is required to sit on two Committees and an hon. Member must be in the appropriate Committee, if he is moving an amendment.<br><br>
The existing first four codes of practice cover the police's exercise of their powers of stop and search; the search of premises and the seizure of property; the detention, treatment and questioning of suspects; and the identification of persons by the police. They came into force on 1 January 1986 as a bold novelty—the first ever attempt at the comprehensive regulation of police procedures with regard to suspects—and, in the main, they have been a success.<br><br>
Before the introduction of the codes, allegations of police malpractice were commonplace and the practice of "verballing" —the falsification of interview notes by the police—was allegedly widespread. Certainly it took place. The strict provisions in the codes for the contemporaneous noting—now tape recording—of statements made in an interview under caution have made it difficult to fabricate evidence in that way. Similarly, the creation of the role of custody officer who has sole responsibility for the suspect's welfare while in custody and that of the custody record, which details everything which happens to a suspect in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
custody and a copy of which he may take with him when he leaves custody, have largely done away with allegations of physical abuse that used to be made almost routinely by defendants.<br><br>
The codes represent a major step forward in protecting the suspect and making the police more accountable. Breaches of the code are disciplinary offences and may result in the exclusion of evidence at the trial. Because the codes were such an innovation, however, it was Parliament's intention to keep them under review. After five years of experience there are a number of additions and improvements that can usefully be made. The review process, which has been very thorough and has taken nearly three years, has produced comments and suggestions from a wide range of individuals and organisations, including those representing the police, the legal profession, civil liberties interests and community groups. Wherever there has been disagreement we have tried to reach the best compromise we can, balancing the practical demands of effective policing against the need to safeguard the interests of those coming into contact with the police.<br><br>
I shall go through the codes in turn and say a little about the changes that are proposed.<br><br>
Code A covers the stopping and seaching of people who are thought to be carrying weapons or stolen goods. The police have made it clear that they are not happy with the guidance it currently contains about the level of suspicion —"reasonable" suspicion—which is required before they can use their powers. They have found the wording of the guidance contained in the annex to the code so restrictive that, in many cases, it is easier to arrest someone than to justify a compulsory stop and search. That defeats the original intention of Parliament, which was to give the police a useful power which stopped short of arrest when that was unnecessary. Only about one in six or one in seven stops leads to an arrest; all the other people who are stopped may go free at once.<br><br>
We have attempted to shorten and simplify the guidance on stop and search to make it easier to understand and apply, while retaining the important safeguards agsinst stopping people on the basis of racial or other stereotyped images.<br><br>
Code B deals with the searching of premises and the siezure of property. The comments we have received suggest that it is working well. The police are, it seems, scrupulously following the guidelines and there is no suggestion that they ever exceed their powers. However, there was a general feeling that there should be a better system for telling someone whose premises are being searched about the extent of his rights and those of the police. With that in mind, we have proposed the introduction of a new notice of powers and rights which the police will give to the occupier of premises that are to be searched. It will explain the powers under which the police are acting, what they are allowed to do and to what the occupier is entitled. We all realise that having one's home searched is a traumatic experience and we hope the new notice will help to ensure at least that people are properly informed about what is going on, and under what power.<br><br>
Code C, which is important, covers detention, treatment and questioning, and it received easily the most attention during our review. There were two main concerns—access
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0195">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
to legal advice and the recording and verification of conversations between police and suspects. Major changes are proposed in both areas.<br><br>
While there was some initial disagreement on legal advice between the police on one side and the legal profession and academics on the other, the consensus that emerged was that the code as it stands contains loopholes which enable the police to impede a suspect's access to legal advice. I am certainly not suggesting that that happens as a matter of course, but research, notably by the university of Birmingham, suggests that some police officers sometimes use what are described as "ploys" to prevent or delay access. Examples might include reading a suspect his rights too quickly, suggesting that legal advice will not help him, or emphasising that it might lead to a longer period in custody. We are putting forward a number of amendments to the code intended to ensure that a suspect will get full and fair access to legal advice. The draft revision will place emphasis on the custody officer giving the suspect clear information about his right to free legal advice and acting quickly in response to any request to see a lawyer. There will be a specific prohibition on dissuading suspects from getting legal advice by any means and posters advertising the right will be displayed in all charge rooms. There will be a new requirement for reminders of the right to access to be given prior to any interview, detention review, indentity parade or before taking an intimate sample. Also, greater emphasis will be placed on providing the information for non-English speakers in translation. Linked to all that will be a new and tight restriction on the circumstances in which interviewing can take place away from the police station. That will be based on Court of Appeal decisions and means that interviews outside the police station, which are usually conducted without legal advice, will be substantially ruled out.<br><br>
The other main improvement proposed for code C involves a significant strengthening of the rules for recording and verifying interviews and other comments made by suspects. The new definition of an interview as the questioning of a person regarding his involvement or suspected involvement in a criminal offence or offences is wide-ranging and borrows from a series of Court of Appeal judgments. Under the revised code, the interviewee will normally have an opportunity to read the record and sign it as correct, or say how he disagrees with it. Also—and very importantly—a similar system will apply to comments made outside an interview that might be relevant to the offence.<br><br>
In summary, the main purpose of our work in revising code C has been to improve information about, and access to, legal advice, while at the same time tightening the rules on recording what is said and checking those records. I think that the result is a fairer system that will provide better evidence and increase public confidence in it. I will not, however, go through all the other changes we are proposing to code C, many of which are of a fairly minor nature.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I press the Minister about the recording evidence, especially where statements are recorded on tape? I understand that after taping, police officers are often required to write a transcript of the statement. Will that practice continue or does the Minister agree that it would be better for the transcript to be prepared by a professional typist?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member raises a difficult problem of practicality because, although the full statement is available and its accuracy as a true record is verified or otherwise by the interviewee, the Crown prosecution service requires a summary of the statement when deciding whether to prosecute. Various methods of providing that summary have been tried, for example, it may be made at a later date or at the same time as the original statement, especially when the officer himself summarises the main points of the interview for the CPS and the interviewee agrees them. The hon. Gentleman has put his finger on something on which there has been no final agreement about what is the best practice. Efforts are made to find a method that places as little pressure as possible on police time—the hon. Gentleman will appreciate that the codes demand much police time. The police will, however, produce the necessary summary material—for the CPS in particular —in a manner that the suspect accepts and approves.<br><br>
There is a new requirement in paragraph 3.2 for detained persons to be provided with a notice of entitlements. We have been encouraged to introduce that notice—which will supplement the main notice of basic rights—by several boards of lay visitors, who have pointed out that the text of the codes, which people at police stations are entitled to consult, are difficult to understand. The new notice will address, in simple language, such things as visits, food and drink, toilets and washing facilities, clothing, medical attention and exercise.<br><br>
Under code D, there has been significant re-organisation of the material covering identification of suspects by witnesses. The main addition proposed is a whole new section about identification using video technology. The police have already begun making use of "video" parades in certain circumstances to replace traditional identity parades. The witness is shown a video film of a sequence of persons, including the suspect, and is invited to make an identification. That can be very useful where geographical factors, or the fact that there are a large number of witnesses who cannot all be brought together, make it difficult to use conventional methods. The new provisions have been drawn up in close consultation with the Metropolitan police who have already had success with them.<br><br>
If approved, the revised codes will come into force on 1 April 1991. Officers will receive training in advance of that date on the basis of a training package that is being devised centrally. Further guidance on the codes and the layouts for the new forms will be included in a Home Office circular to the police that will be issued in the new year.<br><br>
The review shows that the codes have been a successful innovation and that selective improvement rather than wholesale redrafting is necessary. We have done that. Obviously, we have not been able to please everyone, but I am satisfied that the new codes will be better than their predecessors in guiding the police in the exercise of their powers and in protecting the well-being of a suspect and the integrity of his evidence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the new codes were intended to come into practice on 1 January, but that, following further consultation, they will now do so on 1 April. What changes were made following those further consultations?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0196">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Some of the original changes made in the summer have been withdrawn. One change, for example, related to obtaining an inspector's approval to carry out a search of a prisoner's home. It is not always practicable, however, to follow that practice because an inspector is not always available. We want to find a way in which such a search could be undertaken in exceptional circumstances without written approval and that will be covered by the circular to be issued in January.</span></p>
<p>10.46 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Maclennan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Caithness and Sutherland)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the fact that the Minister has taken the time to explain the changes in detail as they are important and strengthen the codes. Those changes have been introduced in the light of five years' experience and widespread comment.<br><br>
I welcome the proposed changes relating to stop and search, entry, search and seizure, detention, the treatment and questioning of suspects, and identification. I welcome especially the notice of entitlements that will be issued to those who are detained. The range of matters covered by that notice has been extended, which is helpful.<br><br>
What does the Minister think about the apparent slowness of the introduction of audio taping of interviews with defendants? Audio taping of interviews has been entirely validated and it is disappointing that it has taken so long to ensure that the practice is universal. I understand that the system may be fully operational by the end of the next financial year, but perhaps the Minister could confirm that.<br><br>
What about the use of videotapes of interviews? I understand that three experiments have been taking place for a couple of months in police stations in Edmonton, the West Midlands and West Yorkshire which are being overseen by Birmingham university and a committee consisting of representatives of all police forces, the Home Office, the Lord Chancellor's Department, the Magistrates' Association and others. Additionally, a committee under the chairmanship of the Crown prosecution service is investigating the possible wider application of video taping in the legal system. I accept that something is being done, but such action is proceeding slowly. Perhaps the Minister will give a progress report when he winds up.<br><br>
It was suggested in another place that the number of investigations into the effectiveness of video taping might be increased from three experiments to six. Doubt has been raised in academic circles about whether video taping should be used more widely throughout police stations and not only where formal interviews take place. It would be extremely expensive to video all public places but experience in Canada suggest that it would be worthwhile to experiment along those lines. The physical structure of police stations means that custody officers cannot always oversee who has access to the cells. If all public areas were videoed, it would eliminate disputes about whether an officer went to the cells unofficially to conduct an informal interview when the prisoner was supposed to be alone. There would be practical difficulties, but I believe that the Canadian experience would help.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman describing cells as public places?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I was describing other places within a station such as those that lead to the cells.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
The final matter that I want to raise with the Minister is the report on advice and assistance at police stations and the 24-hour duty solicitor scheme. Mr. Andrew Sanders and his colleagues at Birmingham university met the Lord Chancellor and discussed some interesting findings that are germane to the matters that we are considering. I wonder whether those findings were taken into account when drawing up the codes of practice. It is remarkable that the police station studied in the report, which had no 24-hour duty solicitor scheme, had very few requests for the service. Criticism was also made of solicitors, which causes concern. The report challenged the findings of Baldwin and Hill in 1988 who concluded that most solicitors have
<br><blockquote><p>"a high level of commitment to the underlying principles of legal aid work"—</p></blockquote>
and—
<br><blockquote><p>"that a high standard of service is provided".</p></blockquote>
Baldwin and Hill based their research on what solicitors say they do but Sanders's work revealed a great contrast between what solicitors do and what they say they do.<br><br>
It has been suggested that it might help to reduce the amount of money paid for being on stand-by while increasing the incentives for solicitors to attend suspects. I wonder what monitoring is taking place to ensure that the scheme is effective. It is dominated by members of the legal profession and research relies on solicitors assessing their own work. The Sanders report suggests that there is scope for improvement in the efficiency and provision of the duty service.</span></p>
<p>10.54 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Kim Howells <span class='memberconstituency'>(Pontypridd)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister help me with some of the details in paragraph 1(c) relating to the search of premises? We do not have the specific codes before us, but the Minister was kind enough to allude to certain details that we would do well to consider.<br><br>
I refer the Minister to the vexed question of entering and searching premises, whether on a drugs bust or in research of evidence of insider dealing. I welcome the attempt to tighten the codes, but I am not sure what form that will take. Obviously, in most criminal investigations, people cannot be given notice that their premises are to be searched if that search is to be effective. Will the details in the codes include, for example, a provision that doors should remain on their hinges where possible when a search takes place? What amendments to the specific details of the codes will be made? Will they be explained when someone enters a property? How will such provisions work in practice?</span></p>
<p>10.56 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise again for the absence of my hon. Friend the Member for Huddersfield (Mr. Sheerman) who is still on his feet in the other Committee. Although I did not expect to attend this committee I have a long list of questions to ask the Minister.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan) asked whether video recordings should be taken at more police stations. I have some sympathy with that argument because there must still be a few people who give statements in police custody only because they are pressurised to do so. It would be extremely difficult, however, to video effectively many of our old police stations. The police station in Stockport, for example is an indequate building. Money would be better spent on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0197">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
providing better accommodation in police stations than on videoing the grotty conditions in which people have to work.<br><br>
Rather than worrying about abuses in police stations, we should worry about whether people are interviewed in the back of a car going to the police station. Most policemen are equipped with two-way radios. Technically, it is easy for those radios to operate on an open system. When someone is brought to a police station in the back of a car, it is possible for instructions to be given that any conservation that takes place should be reported to police communication headquarters. In most police forces, such communications are recorded, and it would be useful to consider the value of such recordings.<br><br>
In common with my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells) I am anxious about searches. In Greater Manchester, there is an increasing problem posed by people who have, perhaps, been up to no good and who keep dogs such as pit bull terriers or rottweilers on their premises. That causes problems for police wishing to carry out searches. By the time they have managed to ensure that the dog is safe enough to allow them to proceed, drugs and other substances have disappeared down the toilet or out of the premises. What is the Home Office doing about that problem? The Government give assurances that they are tackling the problem of dangerous dogs, but I want to know specifically what they are doing about it.<br><br>
I asked the Minister about the authorisation for a search passing from an inspector down to someone else. I am not sure whether he was happy with his reply. A note was passed to him and he may want to say more. In what circumstances would authorisation pass down one rung of the command system? Originally, the idea of specifying the authorisation of senior officers was to ensure that there was no abuse.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Huddersfield (Mr. Sheerman) has returned to the Committee, so I shall sit down.</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barry Sheerman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Huddersfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Hill, for my late arrival. Two or three members of this Committee are also members of the Committee considering the Criminal Justice Bill. I was moving an amendment to that Bill and thus I could not be present in this Committee. I sincerely apologise for my absence and for missing the Minister's speech. This legislation is important, and it should not be allowed to pass on the nod.<br><br>
A codes of practice introduced earlier this year were withdrawn because many people outside the House considered they were flawed. Academics and others made representations and the Government withdrew the codes. I believe that this is the second attempt to get it right—perhaps the hon. Gentleman will correct me if I am wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The codes were withdrawn and modified in several respects. I do not, however, accept the hon. Gentleman's suggestion that they were flawed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sheerman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We can disagree on that. Our understanding is that it was said, constructively, that the original codes were a bit of a mess. This is the new and improved version. If I am wrong, I hope that the Minister will intervene and say how the codes differs from the original.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I said to the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett), we want to reconsider the matter of authority given to search a suspect's home. The requirement is that authority should be given by an inspector, but an inspector is not always immediately available when a search is needed quickly in exceptional circumstances.<br><br>
I should have mentioned earlier the provision for suspects who change their minds about whether they want legal advice. It should be the practice that their change of mind is recorded in writing by the suspects themselves so that it is clear that it is their change of mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sheerman</span> <span class='membercontribution'><i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend press the Minister further about a suspect changing his mind and deciding that he does not want legal advice? I understand that sometimes a suspect says that he wants legal advice, but that takes a little time. Someone says to him, "Don't waste your time waiting for a lawyer, let's get on with it," and the suspect agrees. It is at that moment that it should be recorded that the individual has taken a firm decision to dispense with legal advice. I hope that that is the subject of our discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Such advice should not be given. Any persuasion not to seek legal advice is outside the code and is a matter for disciplinary action.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sheerman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's intervention was most useful and the Committee will mull it over.<br><br>
One of the original criticisms of the code was about the knock-on effect that a breach of it would have in court. We understood that a judge could decide whether to ignore evidence that was obtained in breach of the code. There was no question about rights in law; a judge could simply say, "this evidence was obtained in breach of the code, but I shall allow it because this is my court and it is my prerogative." I ask the Minister, in a constructive spirit, to say whether the code meets that criticism—or is the status quo as strong as we might expect it to be?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Transgression of the code is a matter for disciplinary action by the police authorities. Clearly, the courts, especially the Court of Appeal, have taken a dim view of evidence that has apparently been obtained in breach of the code, but it is for the court to decide.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sheerman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To leave such matters with the Court of Appeal and with the courts is a cause for continued anxiety. Will the Minister confirm that there are still cases in which evidence that is obtained in breach of the code leads to a conviction which is not overturned on appeal?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Whether the evidence is acceptable is for the courts to decide; it is not for any other authority. That used to be the case and still is now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Mullin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: (Sunderland, South): Perhaps I can help my hon. Friend. The problem is that courts have shown themselves willing to accept any old nonsense that is put before them. An enormous amount of fraud and perjury, which is carefully organised by large numbers of police officers ranging in rank from detective constable to assistant chief constable, has got past judges on a fairly systematic basis for a long period. The codes, however well intentioned, do not address that problem.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0198">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sheerman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend put that important point far more brisquely than I could. Whatever my hon. Friends the Members for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) and for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin) may say in criticism, the code should protect the rights of citizens. If those rights are to be improved, the code, which is to be significantly changed, should deal with that problem. If that problem is not met, the code is not good enough. The Government should use this opportunity to tighten up the right of the citizen not to have such evidence used in court against him, if it is obtained in breach of the code.<br><br>
Could not a guarantee be set in concrete in the police and criminal evidence code to ensure that people are given a solicitor? Time and again, all those in the justice lobby—or the high quality lobby industry—have pointed out that in police stations a high percentage of people—often, to put it mildly, the least adequately organised people—do not get a solicitor's advice. The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 was surely intended to guarantee that advice. In that way we could redress the imbalance between the well-heeled citizen, who has access to a solicitor regularly and knows the ropes, and the sometimes rather inadequate person who is picked up on a charge, does not know his or her rights, does not have access to a solicitor and is frightened by the whole process. To improve the code we should ensure that all citizens get a solicitor's advice by right.</span></p>
<p>11.10 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mullin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously the code of practice is welcome in so far as it goes. However, as I said in my intervention, it does not address the serious problem of systematic criminality on the part of those charged with interviewing suspects.<br><br>
The Minister will know that since tape and video recording were introduced, — though not, as yet, very widely—there has been a sudden outbreak of confessions in the backs of cars on the way to police stations. The best known case is that of Mr. Hassan Khan, who was alleged to have dictated a 22-page confession on a journey between north Wales and the west midlands. When the police officer involved was asked to replicate that feat in court he was unable to do so. As a result Mr. Khan was released. There have been several similar examples.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a good example, although it is outdated in relation to the code. The hon. Gentleman suggested in his intervention that courts were ever ready to accept evidence which was unsound or in breach of the code. He has just given an example where courts have found otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mullin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is because those concerned had been caught out once too often. We should not get too euphoric. Judges are growing less gullible and stupid in their attitude towards police evidence. The position is improving in the face of one or two extraordinary developments, and others which may unfold further in the coming months. We still have a long way to travel.<br><br>
There were two unrelated cases in the west midlands, involving two gentlemen called Twitchwell and Treadaway, who confessed in police custody. They said that plastic bags were held over their heads to assist their thought processes. Long confessions swiftly resulted, even
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
though both of them had long criminal records, were tough individuals and had no history of confessing to any crime in which they were alleged to have been involved.<br><br>
There was no other evidence against the men, but considerable evidence to suggest that plastic bags were held over their heads. The police went to some lengths to keep solicitors away for the men's first day or two in police custody. The solicitor involved in one of those cases —I cannot remember which—went so far as to ring up the assistant chief constable in an attempt to get access to his client, but failed.<br><br>
The code of practice will not have much relevance to such cases, well-intentioned and useful though it is. Nor will it have much relevance to the case of Mr. Derek Gordon, which also unfolded in the West Midlands. I am sorry to go on about this. He confessed to murder while in the custody of the West Midlands police and had to be released nine months later when the murderer was caught. There have been more than 20 or 30 cases in the past few——</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sheerman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand why my hon. Friend is citing those interesting cases. However, my view and, I am sure, that of this side of the Committee is that we have a damn good police force in Britain. There are some rotten apples, which should be rooted out and dealt with, and the code of practice should enable us to do that. When one comes out with a whole series of criticisms of the police, people may think that the whole police force is being castigated. I do not wish to give that impression. There are some pretty rotten apples in the police force, as in most professions. There are some very bad cases in certain police forces, and the ones that my hon. Friend has described are appalling. However, the police do a super job in Britain, as I am sure my hon. Friend will agree.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mullin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not my case that all police officers behave in that way—clearly they do not. However, I am not complacent in the light of what we now know about the problem. Rather than a few rotten apples, there is the odd rotten barrel here and there.<br><br>
The obvious long-term solution, which is not found in the codes—perhaps it is a matter for the Standing Committee on the Criminal Justice Bill further along the Corridor—would be to outlaw confessions in police custody unless they are witnessed by an independent source, such as a lawyer. That will have to be done eventually because at the root of all miscarriages of justice—beginning with Timothy Evans in 1950—lie confessions made in the custody of police officers and not witnessed by anyone else. They are at the root of the Guildford convictions, which have already been quashed. Such confessions form one of the two main elements in the Birmingham convictions which, in due course, will collapse. They are a feature of almost every major proven or alleged miscarriage of justice.<br><br>
Is the Home Office thinking about this issue? The Home Office must have noticed that there is a problem. In the light of recent events, I cannot believe that no one has drawn to the Minister's attention the fact that a serious problem arises relating to confessions in police custody. If that is so, what is to be done?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Evennett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Erith and Crayford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the hon. Gentleman has highlighted a number of cases where things have gone very wrong. However, we should not judge the overall situation by a few bad cases. Does the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0199">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
hon. Gentleman agree that we have attempted to make the code better? Will he join the hon. Member for Huddersfield (Mr. Sheerman) in praising the police generally for doing a first-class job?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mullin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I made that clear, but one would have to be blind not to notice that the problem is fairly serious. Serveral Conservative Members have drawn that fact to my attention in the past few days.<br><br>
If the Minster will not take notice of what I say, perhaps he will remember the comments of judges. The Birmingham pub bombings case will soon come before the Court of Appeal, where it will be demonstrated that the confessions are fabricated. At the orginal trial, the judge, Lord Bridge, said that if the defendants were telling the truth—he made it clear to the court that he thought otherwise—the police had been involved in the "greatest conspiracy in the annals of criminal history". He then mapped it out, saying that it would have meant that officers from two forces, ranging in rank from detective constable to assistant chief constable, systematically involved in fraud and perjury. Lord Bridge spelt that out in one and a half pages of transcript. He was not talking about the odd rotten apple; he was saying that, if the defendants were telling the trugh, the problem was vast.<br><br>
In the Guildford and Woolwich case, where it has already been proved that confessions were fabricated, the trial judge, Lord Donaldson—now Master of the Rolls—made it clear that he did not believe the defendants, but he was subsequently proved wrong. He intervened in Sir Michael Havers' presentation of the case for the Crown, saying, "Sir Michael, if the defendants are telling the truth, how many police officers would have to be involved in a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice?" Sir Michael—not me—replied: "About 100, my lord." About three have been charged so far, so the question in hon. Members' minds must be, "What happened to the other 97?" Lord Donaldson was talking not about the odd rotten apple but about a fairly large-scale problem. It would be wise to face up to it, although I repeat that not every police officer behaves like that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Dickens <span class='memberconstituency'>(Littleborough and Saddleworth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: No doubt the hon. Gentleman will agree that there must be circumstantial evidence as well as confessions in court and that a person is seldom convicted on a confession—indeed, a warning is sometimes given that it is unsafe to convict on confessions, as it involves uncorroborated evidence. It used to be the case that the uncorroborated evidence of a child could not lead to a conviction. Juries were instructed that they could not convict on a child's uncorroborated evidence. Now one child, whether sworn or unworn, can corroborate the evidence of another. We are talking about corroboration of evidence as well as confessions and other circumstances leading to convictions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mullin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Unhappily, that is not so. Courts often convict solely on the basis of confessions in police custody. As I said, that explains some of the great miscarriages of justice in history. Timothy Evans was hanged on that basis. The four people convicted of the Guildford and Woolwich pub bombings were convicted solely on the basis of confessions that have been shown to be fabricated.<br><br>
In the Birmingham pub bombings, the defendants were convicted on the basis of forensic evidence that has been shown—to put it at its most generous—to be mistaken.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
Four confessions were signed in police custody in the Broadwater Farm case—another case which has received great publicity. Two people were convicted only on the basis of confessions in police custody. Winston Silcott did not confess even while in police custody and I know of nothing that would demonstrate his guilt. In the Carl Bridgewater case—another that was referred recently to the Court of Appeal—confessions in police custody are the main issue.<br><br>
The problem is serious and cannot easily be avoided. One reason for it is the willingness of courts to accept any old nonsense put in front of them. When it is obvious to people who travel on buses, for example, that something is wrong with the Crown's version of events, it is not always obvious to judges. That does not, of course, concern the Committee.<br><br>
Will the Minister say whether the Home Office has thought about the obvious solution, which is to outlaw uncorroborated confessions in police custody? That would remove the incentive for systematic intimidation in police custody. It would not prevent gratuitous intimidation, but it would prevent systematic intimidation of the type alleged. It would also oblige those who wish to catch the real culprits to proceed on the basis of evidence rather than on what can be dreamt up in the confines of a police station.</span></p>
<p>11.22 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Teresa Gorman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Billericay)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with interest to the serious questions raised. In all our debates on the police, we always assume that it is only the police who handle these matters and that individuals are interrogated whether or not they are guilty because they are suspect.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin) has taken a great deal of interest in codes of practice. Perhaps such codes should include provision for an independent arbitrator who would be present simply to watch and listen—to monitor both sides. This issue is serious and can have serious consequences, but it is always assumed that only two parties are involved—the police, with all the panoply of the law behind them, and the suspect, who may, through ignorance or fear, choose not to opt for a lawyer. Should there not be an automatic arbitration service to bring in another individual who would act simply as an ombudsman, or witness to events?</span></p>
<p>11.24 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Many issues have been raised in different ways. I shall respond to each of them.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan) asked about the audio taping of interviews. Our objective is to have all police forces taping all interviews by the end of 1991. Police forces have proceeded at different paces, but we think that the practice can be universal across the country by the end of next year. Police forces are experimenting with video taping, but it has yet to be demonstrated that any benefits justify its greater cost than that of audio taping. We shall consider the matter carefully over a period and in a variety of circumstances. I understand the hon. Gentleman's concern that if it is beneficial, we should make it a widespread practice as soon as practicable.<br><br>
My colleagues and I will consider the video taping of public areas in police stations and elsewhere. I do not believe that that would be of great benefit. I thought that the hon. Gentleman was asking for the video taping of cells.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0200">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
If there is untoward activity, it often takes place in the cells, but I am sure that prisoners would not wish to appear on television screens all the time.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the solicitor scheme, which is a matter for the Lord Chancellor's Department. I know that the Lord Chancellor is aware of the criticisms and is considering how they may best be dealt with.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The matter was raised again during other interventions. The Sanders report states that the key problem is that in an action against police behaviour the presumption in PACE is against having advice. Section 58 is triggered on a positive request by the suspect, yet there is no obligation or practice of explaining the mechanism or financial arrangements. If PACE required a positive decision to refuse advice, the take-up rate would probably rise considerably. I think that the hon. Member for Huddersfield (Mr. Sheerman) was also concerned about that. Perhaps the onus should be the other way round.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are two references in the codes. First, it must be made clear to a suspect before he is interviewed at a police station that he has access to legal advice and that that advice is free. That must be presented to a suspect in a way that he understands and he must be advised that if he declines to have legal advice, as is sometimes the case, the interview should not go ahead until he has expressed his wish. He must do so in writing and not simply by ticking a box or signing something written by someone else. That goes a long way to meeting the hon. Gentleman's concern.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells) asked about the changes to the rules on searches. The only change is in the requirement that when premises are searched, the owner or householder must be told clearly in writing of the authority for the search, the extent of police powers and his various rights, including the right to compensation if appropriate. The powers to search have not been altered in the codes.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) commented on the state of some police stations and said that money should be spent there instead of on video recording. I agree that some police stations are not as up to date and suitable as others, but it is important for the experiment on video recording to take place because it may yield beneficial techniques for pursuing suspects and cases, and ensure the rights of suspects as well as help the police.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not against video recording, but when resources are short it would be better to ensure that accommodation—for example the interview rooms and custody areas in the Stockport police station—is adequate rather than to install video cameras. Apart from anything else, conditions in the Stockport police station are so cramped that many cameras would be needed to pick out every nook and cranny. Conditions for prisoners and police officers would be greatly improved if the police station was replaced with modern, efficient accommodation. It would then be fairly easy to monitor what was going on with one or two cameras rather than having to install the large number that would be necessary in the present, appalling conditions.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's argument. All of us, especially those in Government, know that there are a variety of demands on resources, and that decisions must be made. Such judgments must be made by the police authorities too.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) and other hon. Members are worried about interviews in the back of a police car. The hon. Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin) spoke about a 22-page transcript of such an interview.<br><br>
It is clear from the present codes of practice that interviews may not be conducted in the back of a police car—they must be held in a police station. It is incumbent on the officer involved to write down any relevant remarks made in the police car. He is required to ensure that the suspect reads them and states whether they are a true and accurate record of what was said. An interview, in which a police officer questions a suspect about his alleged involvement in an offence, must be conducted in the police station after the suspect has been informed of his rights, not least his rights to legal advice, as also required in the codes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mullin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that under the codes of practice suspects may not be interviewed in the backs of police cars. Is he suggesting that those codes are legally enforceable? If a police officer chose to ignore them, surely that matter would have to be argued in court.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before it was argued in court, it would have to be argued with the officer's superiors. It would be a disciplinary offence if an officer sought to conduct an interview in the back of a police car.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mullin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That gives me no confidence. In the cases that I cited, and in many others, irregularities drawn to the attention of an officer's superiors, up to the level of assistant chief constable, have been overlooked. The assistant chief constable who was invited to London by the Home Office to interview me in connection with the case of the Birmingham pub bombings some years ago was caught only last week suppressing evidence before a judge in court. It gives me no confidence to hear that responsibility will lie with senior officers when they might choose, for whatever reason, to turn a blind eye to irregularities in many cases.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When such an event occurs it is a cause of complaint against the police. The hon. Gentleman is wrong to ascribe virtually no effect to the codes of practice. They were introduced in 1986 and have made a great difference to the way in which suspects are treated and to the process of providing evidence for the courts. They may be far from perfect, but they have made a great difference. The additions to the code will be a further, important help.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerald Bermingham <span class='memberconstituency'>(St. Helens, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for being late to the Committee. I was part of a delegation to another Minister.<br><br>
I raise a purely practical point that relates to the matter of notes made or written up immediately after a comment made in a car, at the scene of an arrest and so on. It all depends on when they are placed before the suspect for signing, and that has created many problems.<br><br>
Would it not be sensible to put in the guidance that such notes should be shown to the suspect in the presence of his legal adviser as soon as is practicable and within a reasonable time? That may save many arguments later in the court room.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0201">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is right. It is an important point that will be further considered in the circular to be issued in the new year about how the codes are to be used. The comments that are relevant to a case and made in the back of a car should be shown to the suspect to confirm or otherwise and his comments should be recorded.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the circular goes out to chief constables, how will officers be made aware of the changes? A lot of training is involved in introducing the codes and it will be quite a task to ensure that all officers know about the changes by 1 April. Will the Minister tell us briefly how that will be achieved?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot tell the hon. Gentleman in detail about the training proposed, but I suggested in my opening remarks that after the circular is isssued it will be important for training to be organised for each police force so that the revised codes are properly understood. Police officers must be made aware of what is required of them by the changes in the codes and that is the responsibility of the chief officer.<br><br>
I appreciate that the hon. Member for Huddersfield (Mr. Sheerman) has had to return to the Criminal Justice Bill Committee. He raised a number of points, some of which we have already covered. But, in particular, it is worth repeating that the hon. Gentleman wanted there to be no interview until the suspect had been told his rights. An important part of the change to the codes is the requirement that a prisoner's rights and other possibilities and considerations open to him, such as visits and making a call to a person other than a legal advisor, are available to him. Therefore, no interview will take place before his rights to legal representation and the fact that it may be free, are made clear to him.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin) talked about back of the car confessions, to which we have also referred. Many of his case examples, however, are under investigation because they relate to the west midlands and from the expression on his face, he is familiar with that reply. The hon. Gentleman will also accept that many of the cases he rehearses date back well before PACE. I know that he referred to one or two that occurred afterwards, which are a matter of concern, but I hope he will accept two things. First, that the Government accepted that there was a great problem—not just one of a few bad
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
apples—with certain practices, which PACE was designed to tackle. Secondly, I hope that he accepts that the codes of practice were a serious attempt to give guidance to the police as to how they should proceed with difficult tasks. The police were reluctant to see those new codes in force because they were well aware of the amount of time and pressure they would put on a busy police officer which he could ill afford. However, experience of the codes over the past three or four years has made the police more positive. They are now seen as giving guidance in good practice which not merely affords protection to the suspect and the police officer but also helps him to pursue a case justly and efficiently. In our consultations over the codes, we found police representatives to be both positive and constructive.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Huddersfield asked, in particular, about confessions made while a suspect was in police custody. I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, which is being considered by the May inquiry and, no doubt, we shall return to the matter in due course. We both know that although codes cannot rule out improper behaviour by police officers, they can go a long way towards making it difficult for improper procedures to be disguised. It is still possible for them to be disguised, but we have greatly reduced that possibility by our actions.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Member for Sunderland, South will accept that although in the past police officers may have proceeded in a way that they should not, some suspects have also claimed that improper procedures were followed when that was not so.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman accepted the useful intervention from his hon. Friend the Member for Huddersfield and I hope that he will also accept not merely that most of the police force do a difficult job as well as they can, but that they are aided by the codes of practice and that the changes to them will improve procedures still more.</span></p>
