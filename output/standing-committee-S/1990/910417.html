<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not here to perform the role of an awkward customer and I am sure that members of the Committee will agree that, especially at present, no measures concerning the rights of children and their interests should go through the House of Commons without scrutiny. For self-evident reasons, we had no Second Reading debate on the Bill. In principle, it has a great deal of merit. However, there are anxieties which, I hope, can be allayed by the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir N. Fairbairn). I speak with some diffidence as the Bill is presented and supported by a bevy of parliamentary notables, but I expect to receive a reasonable hearing from the hon. and learned Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a recent article, Professor Thomson, a professor of law at Glasgow university said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At the very least, should the Age of Capacity (Scotland) Bill proceed any further, it should be subject to detailed and critical parliamentary scrutiny."</p></blockquote>
I am sure that we agree with that. Similarly, Kathleen Marshall, the director of the Scottish child law centre said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The effects of the Bill, if enacted, will be much wider and more radical than envisaged by the consultation process and the research. The Bill will alter the status of young people in Scotland"—</p></blockquote>
she is referring especially to clause 1—
	<br><blockquote><p>"between the ages of 12 and 16, depriving them of fundamental rights to make or influence decisions bearing on control of their own persons."</p></blockquote>
Those legitimate anxieties are worthy of tough-minded scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The helpful explanatory memorandum to the Bill states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"subsection (1)(a) implements the new rule that, subject to certain limited exceptions set out in clause 2, a person under the age of 16 shall have no legal capacity to enter into transactions."</p></blockquote>
Later in the debate, I shall question the hon. and learned Gentleman on his definition of "transactions". It is fair to say that laymen and laywomen would interpret the word "transactions" as meaning a commercial or legal transaction. However, if one looks for definitions of the word "transaction" in the Scottish dictionary or the second edition of the Oxford English dictionary, one finds a plethora of descriptions of it, including "a covenant" and "negotiated agreement". For example, if a youngster is examined by a doctor and they come to an agreement, by way of the doctor's professional expertise, about the method of treatment to cure the young person's illness, is that a transaction? If a young girl is interviewed by a social
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
worker because of serious allegations of abuse in her family, is it a transaction if an agreement is reached whereby the child accepts that certain action should be taken to protect her?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to dwell on the subject but I seek guidance from the hon. and learned Gentleman on the advisability of limiting clause 1 to "transactions", as my amendment would do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and Kinross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I compliment the hon. member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman) on his civility to advise me that he would table amendments to ensure that the principles behind the Bill were certain and sure, and that its concept was not mistaken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the Bill is to protect children while they are presumed immature, without in any way invading their capacity to contract in normal ways. Present law is based on two extraordinary fantasies which are the father and mother of the law of Scotland. The first relates to fertility. A girl child is presumed to alter her contractual status on the basis of the fact that she starts ovulating at 12. A boy child is assumed to alter his status contract because he is presumed to be fertile at the age of 14.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those factors have an echo in the corpus juris civilis of the law of Rome about the liberation of slaves. It is fatuous that we have continued to accept in the law of Scotland protections, alterations and language that have nothing to do with contractual ability. The Bill proposes an important reform that would sweep away provisions based on mirage and mystique with no basis of maturity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am unwilling to accept the hon. Gentleman's amendment because, although status is altered at the age of 16, any child can enter into any contract that a child is likely to enter into, such as buying a Mars bar or a bottle of Pepsi. That is a contract or, if the hon. Gentleman wishes, a transaction. In the Bill there are four exceptions, including making a will, but the amendment runs counter to the Bill and would take us back to the concept of minors and pupils. At present and, I hope, after the Bill is passed any child can enter into any transaction that at that age it is likely to enter into without consent. A child cannot buy an estate or a Roll-Royce because that is not expected, but it can buy a Mars bar, a Coca-Cola, a book or whatever else a child is expected to buy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general law of Scotland is not altered by the Bill. All that is swept away is the archaic concept of minority and pupillage and, with certain protections, the notion that until the quadriennium utile is passed a child can get out of a contract. At present, that is until the child is aged 22, under the concept that it would not enter into a contract that was offensive, which an adult of maturity—if that concept is known to the House—would not have entered into.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Speak for yourself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was speaking to the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow and I am obliged to him for raising the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would merely reverse the situation that we are trying to abolish and bring back the concept of minority and pupillage. The Bill deals with four areas of transaction that are exempted from the general principle that the age of 16 gives full capacity, but to limit the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0178">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
provision to "transactions" would be difficult, whatever the English dictionary may say. I do not know what a transaction is. My winking at the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow might be thought to be a transaction, but it would be unwise to introduce that into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From the silence of normally voluble hon Gentlemen, it seems that they agree with the assurances and accept what the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir Nicholas Fairburn) has said in response to my amendment. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 3, in page 2, line 17, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(h) affect any existing rule or practice whereby a minor may make or influence decisions in relation to control over his own person'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment appears under the name of "Dr Goodman", but I assure you, Mr. Martin, that it is my handiwork, assisted by the Scottish child law centre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, I seek assurances from the hon. and learned Gentleman on the means by which a child can protect itself in difficult family circumstances. I shall use as examples a couple of case studies that involve children in distressing domestic circumstances, I have been given the details of one case—of course, with the usual proviso of protecting confidentiality—that involves a 15-year-old girl who, because of the most appalling circumstances, sought to leave home and move in with her aunt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Social workers are a much maligned body of people, but they are professionals who do fine work on behalf of children and others. Some may say that I must say that as my wife is a senior social worker, but I would say it even if I were not married to that delightful lady.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the hon. Gentleman say 15?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the case involves a girl of 15. The social workers agreed to the girl moving in with her aunt, but they wanted to know whether the girl's parents could force her to return to her family home. As the girl was a minor, no offence would be committed if she left the family home, but the parents could seek a court order for her delivery back to them. Perhaps the hon. and learned Gentleman will correct me if I am wrong, but in those circumstances under existing law the minor's wishes would be regarded as exceptionally weighty and would be adhered to so long as they were not unreasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tabled the amendment because the Bill might reduce the girl to the status of a pupil. The aunt might be threatened with a charge of plagium—child stealing—which applies to pupil children only. The loss of minor's ability to move in with another family member might result in the greater use of the procedures for
	<br><blockquote><p>"taking refuge in a place of safety"</p></blockquote>
and in greater intervention by social workers in cases where that was previously deemed unnecessary. I seek an assurance from the hon. and learned Gentleman about such cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A second case study involves a 14-year-old girl in Strathclyde who made allegations of sexual abuse to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
social work department. Her mother insisted on being present at the interview with the social worker. As the girl is a minor under current law, she has the right to decide on the circumstances of the interview and to have confidentiality respected. It has been claimed to me that an unintended consequence of the Bill would be to deny that young person the right of access to her files and to give that right to the parent. The parent might also be able to insist on being present at such an interview. Under the Bill, would that young girl lose such protection?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without referring to matters that are sub judice, disclosure of abuse is important. My amendment is a probing one and I seek the preservation of the rights of minors to have a degree of control over their person. It is essential that every protection is given to the child in cases of wilful neglect, physical and sexual abuse. Such circumstances are difficult not only for the child, but for professionals, such as doctors, social workers, teachers and others, who try to defend such vulnerable young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my usual way, I am seeking assurances from the hon. and learned Gentleman that help will be offered when the first disclosure of abuse comes to light and children seek help with the violations inflicted on them, perhaps by their own fathers or close relatives. There are cases pending in Scotland and we must ensure that such children are given the utmost protection in the intitial stages of an investigation. The Bill must not harm a vulnerable child who is caught up in such disgusting circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Devlin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stockton, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important issue, which lies at the core of the Children Act 1989. When the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman) referred to Professor Thomson of the university of Strathclyde, he was referring to a speech that was made to the Scottish child law centre on 14th June 1989, which was the day after I spoke on the same subject in the Committee stage of the Children Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman's speech will be helpful, but it will assist the Committee to specify that the Act to which he referred is an English Act and that we do not have a Scottish Children Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Devlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I wondered whether there would be a parity of provision in this Bill with the Children Act 1989, which refers to England and Wales, and future legislation for Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will, as usual, be amazed to know that we have the Law Reform (Parent and Child) (Scotland) Act 1986, which preceded by three years the English legislation and is considerably preferable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Devlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The interesting point about that is that section 1 of the Children Act 1989 refers to the paramountcy of the child's interest and deals with the issue to which the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is anxiety about the way in which children's legislation is being implemented by social work departments throughout the country. It is not yet clear at what age children are capable of saying what their best interests are. In some circumstances, children may be too young to decide what those may be. That is why I referred to my speech on 13 June 1989.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Children Act 1989, the Bill and the Scottish legislation do nothing about the conflicting specifications
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0179">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
of the age of majority. For example, one can own a shotgun at the age of 12, but one cannot buy fireworks until the age of 16. Similarly, one can drive a car at 17, but cannot make a will until 18, although one can join the army. When we consider what is best for children, at what age they should be consulted and at what age their wishes should be paramount, we are in limbo.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Social work departments are interpreting our legislation to mean that they should listen to a child of any age and treat his or her wishes as paramount. That is not what the legislation provides. It provides that the interests—not the wishes—of the child should be paramount. Children often have wishes that are not in their best interests. Because of their extreme youth they are not capable of taking into account all the factors to be considered when a decision is to be taken on their behalf.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Stockton, South (Mr. Devlin) for offering a distinction between the interests of a child and his or her wishes. The behaviour of youngsters who are entering adolescence is often eccentric, to put it mildly. I point out to the hon. Gentleman, with reference to the intervention made by the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir N. Fairbairn), that each legal system can learn from the other about the interests of children. For example, the English system would benefit from the introduction of children's hearings, and the Scottish legal system is lagging behind the English system in respect of the use in evidence of video recorded interviews, as proposed in the Criminal Justice Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Devlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, when we discussed the English legislation, the system of children's hearings was put forward as a good example of what could be done south of the border. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that English and Scottish legal systems can learn from each other in many areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have considerable experience of Scottish Standing Committees and in the past my honourable and learned Friend the Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir N. Fairbairn) has frequently told me that under the Act of Union, the Scots protected their system of law, that that is what distinguishes them from the English, and that there is no reason why the two systems should converge. I am, therefore, interested to hear him today recommending a measure that will do just that. Where will the future distinctions lie?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps I can help the honourable Gentleman. We are considering a Bill that relates exclusively to Scottish law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be extremely brief, Mr. Martin. The Government welcome the Bill. The report on which it is based is the first stage of a major project by the Scottish Law Commission on the law of children. In due course, there will be further reports on the related topics of custody and guardianship and, more generally, the scope of parental rights and duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may interest honourable Members to know that the Scottish Office consulted various interest groups on the Commission's proposals and found that there was substantial support for the recommendations in the report.

The Bill is an important first stage, but other stages will follow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would preserve the legal rights of minors to make or influence decisions relating to control of their own person. I congratulate the honourable Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman) and the Scottish child law centre on drawing attention to possible problems in what is otherwise generally agreed by lawyers in my constituency to be a useful consolidation of the law on legal capacity. It is important to explore the issues and for the sponsors of the Bill to explore the issues and for the sponsors of the Bill to explain clearly how it would affect the existing rights of persons now categorised as minors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill would give legal rights to 16 to 18-year-olds and abolish that category of minors. The onus is on the Bill's sponsors to state clearly why those changes for minors are necessary. I hope that the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir N. Fairbairn) will answer fully the concerns expressed by the Scottish child law centre and say whether its fears are justified.

I greatly regret the passing of forisfamiliation simply because it was a great standby and saw me through many a Scots law test for the Institute of Bankers examinations. No doubt the imagination of examiners will immediately latch on to the Bill, if it is enacted, and a new batch of questions will appear. Has the hon. and learned Gentleman an employment scheme in mind? No doubt every textbook will have to be rewritten and employment will increase as the measure takes effect and the law books have to change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the hon. and learned Gentleman, who has undoubted experience and expertise in practical legal matters, state clearly whether the fears expressed by the Scottish child law centre are justified? Concern centres around personal rights and the main worries expressed require an answer. Will the Bill as drafted, by altering the status of young people between the ages of 12 and 15 or 16, deprive them of the fundamental right to make and influence decisions that affect them? Will it remove the rights that they now have in cases such as those illustrated by my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow? Legal opinion seems to be contradictory and there is no expertise in law. One expert says, "Yes" another says, "No". Will the Bill, as drafted, remove those personal rights from persons currently described as minors? The hon. and learned Gentleman must give a clear answer to that straightforward question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow for raising these issues and I look forward to listening to the right hon. and learned Gentleman's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most obliged to the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman) for raising this matter. We all know about his sensitivity on behalf of children. I am also obliged to my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South (Mr. Devlin) who, as usual, got the law wrong and the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) who asked for confirmation on important matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the present law a child is subject to parental consent for most contracts until the age of 16 and that remains unaltered. All that is altered is the varying capacity

of a child between 12, 14, 16 and 22. We are saying that a child under the age of 16 without forisfamiliation or enorm lesion—to introduce the hon. Member for Angus, East to a term in Scots law of which, as a Scottish Nationalist, he is no doubt ignorant—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman if he can tell me what enorm lesion is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall leave that until later as the hon. and learned Gentleman has more practical experience than me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since the hon. Gentleman clearly does not know, he, unfortunately, despite being over 16 years of age, has failed the exam.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the important matter raised by the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow, the Scottish child law centre is a diligent and concerned association which has expressed anxiety about what it envisages could arise from the Bill. That anxiety is genuine, but groundless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Reform (Parent and Child) (Scotland) Act 1986 is a much more liberal piece of legislation than the Children Act 1989, even if the important speech by the hon. Member for Stockton, South the day after the legislation's birth, put it into history.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A child is subject to parental consent until the age of 16. Indeed, it is a criminal offence to leave a child unattended and without a baby sitter until the age of 14.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is different in England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is different in England. Scotland has responsible law on the protection of children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish child law centre raised several matters, one of which was whether a child could decide its own religion. If a child decides to become a Moonie, Muslim or an aetheist, the parent can do nothing about it. A child's freedom to become a Catholic or to be confirmed is not subject to parental control and the Bill does not alter that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman is absolutely right. Anyone may become an aetheist, a Catholic and so on. Only if a child takes actions as a consequence of his belief—for example, if he decides at the age of 13 or 14 to go away to join a Moonie community—can a parent take action, at least in theory, although it may be a different matter in practice. The anxiety is that under the Bill, parents could not take action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is certainly so. If a child wants to live with glue sniffers or Moonies, the law enables the parent to prevent that, and that would be so under the Bill. A parent who takes the view that a child's actions are against its interests, can prevent such actions in cases such as that to which the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr Maxton) referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are considering extremes in discussing Moonies. If a 13 or 14-year-old Protestant child decides that he wishes to become a Roman Catholic, can the parent prevent the child from attending classes and being confirmed in the Roman Catholic Church and would he be able to do so under the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Only parental persuasion can be used at present and that would be so in future. A parent cannot prevent a child from attending a religious
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
institution unless by force or fear. He cannot persuade a child to go to school unless by force or fear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The law also comes into that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Sam Galbraith	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Strathkelvin and Bearsden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a child changes his religion, for example, from Protestant to Catholic, can he then choose to attend a Catholic school against the wishes of a parent and could he do so under the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I am right in saying that a parent has no right to prevent a child from attending the school of his choice. Whether the school would admit the child is, of course, another matter. It would doubtless consider the wishes of the parent—and so it should.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under the Education Acts, the obligation to ensure that a child attends full-time education until the age of 16 is not the responsibility of the child. On the contrary, it is the responsibility of the parent, and action is taken against the parent if a child fails to attend school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely right. The parent has the right to choose the school to which the child will go. In the event of a child changing religion—a fairly rare event as we are creatures of habit and tend to follow the religion with which we were graced by birth—a complication arises. I am an Episcopalian because my mother was an Episcopalian. I am not a Catholic or a Presbyterian because it did not occur to me to alter the habit with which I was born. As I said, it is a rare event for a child to change religion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a fascinating exchange, but may I respectfully bring the hon. and learned Gentleman back to one of my earlier questions. How stands the child vis-a-vis the law and the Bill if he seeks refuge with his aunt, for example, because one of his parents is abusing him? Could he stay with a relative against the wishes of his parents who wish him to return to the family home?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman for getting us out of the ecclesiastical stratosphere into which we had drifted. Under the Bill, the right of the child from the age of 12 upwards to sign an adoption order in his own interest is absolute. If he wishes to stay with his aunt and his parents disapprove, he can have himself adopted. To that extent he is protected from the age of 12.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill does not make any change to existing law in this area. In the absence of a court order a parent has rights to determine with whom any child under 16 resides. However, the Law Reform (Parent and Child) (Scotland) Act 1986 comes into effect, so a child can secure a court order in his own interest. That applies especially where there has been abuse or estrangement from the family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman a most important issue. I should like to emphasise that the Bill does not in any way impede the protection of any child under 16—on the contrary, it promotes it. A child will be able to opt for adoption by any person with whom he believes the comfort of life may be achieved or the pain of life removed. I am glad that the Scottish child law centre raised this important matter, I assure the hon. Gentleman that the Bill will not undermine the protections of the child; it will enhance them. The

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
child's welfare will be a paramount consideration in any conflict that he may have with his parents. If his aunt secures his best interests, any court—and, under the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968, any hearing—will take into account as a major benefit for him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I am almost always in profound disagreement with the political perspective of the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir N. Fairbairn), I trust and respect his views on the legal protection of children in Scotland. I, therefore, accept what he says. I offer one caveat, and that with some diffidence: it is not an offence per se to leave a child of any age unattended.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I want to bring up an old chestnut which, the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir N. Fairbairn) will not be surprised to hear, relates to subsection (4). That subsection provides a useful and important clarification of the law of consent relating to medical operations. Neither I nor my colleagues were sure whether the age of consent was at 18, 16, 14 or 12 years of age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chestnut that I want to raise relates to the pill. I realise that this is a difficult issue. I understand that parental rights on that matter will not be altered and that the law will stay as it stands, although I am unsure how to interpret it. If a girl under 16 wants to have the pill prescribed, her doctor is not under an obligation to prescribe it for her. Does the doctor have to seek the consent of her parents or are there avenues that he can take, if he thinks that prescribing it would be in the girl's medical interest, without seeking her parents' consent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, should like to speak briefly as I have a couple of questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the notes on clauses, subsection (3), which is most welcome, provides
	<br><blockquote><p>"the rule whereby a minor (a girl aged 12–16 or a boy aged 14–16) must consent to his or her own adoption".</p></blockquote>
They suggest that section 12(8) of the Adoption (Scotland) Act 1978
	<br><blockquote><p>"should be retained but suitably amended to apply to any child aged 12 or over".</p></blockquote>
The notes on clauses are absolutely right to state that
	<br><blockquote><p>"becoming a member, legally, of a new family is such an important step that it should not be imposed against the will of a child old enough to have a decided view; and there seems no reason to deprive a female child of her existing capacity in this area."</p></blockquote>
I wholly agree. It is an extremely sensible measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To follow the path of my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith), who is an
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
expert in medical matters, I shall comment on subsection (4). Paragraph 2 on page 4 of the notes on clauses states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subsection 4 deals with consent to surgical, medical or dental procedure and treatment."</p></blockquote>
I take it that that would include treatment given by a consultant psychiatrist. I know that the hon. and learned Gentleman has definite views on psychiatry. A problem arises here. The same paragraph states:
	<br><blockquote><p>Problems of conflict between parent and child over medical treatment and infringement of parental rights are deliberately left untouched."</p></blockquote>
Why? I, not the Scottish child law centre, wish to know what would be the position of a grievously sick child who was denied medical treatment or hospital treatment because of the parents' religious principles and scruples. Can such principles override the child's need to seek the best treatment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not a lawyer and I may be wrong, but I believe that there have been cases where court action has been raised—presumably by doctors—under the national health service law, which gives the national health service, oddly enough, the right to override the wishes of such parents and treat children under a certain age.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. He states modestly that he is not entirely expert in Scottish law and he may be telling the truth. When I came across that sentence in the notes on clauses, I felt concern. There may be isolated cases of a child being denied treatment because of psychopathic parents or parents who have particular and, in my opinion, extremely strange Christian principles. I seek assurance from the hon. and learned Gentleman that a child caught up in such appalling circumstances could obtain the necessary treatment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to hon. Members who have contributed to the debate, especially to the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith), whom we are delighted to see back in rude health.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rude—I do not know about his health.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was referring to his health, not his tongue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the law is clear because the medical profession has never known for sure whether a child who, for example, was involved in a car accident, could consent to having its leg amputated or whatever treatment was required. It is important that the Bill gives a child over 12 the capacity to consent to a medical operation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to quibble with the hon. and learned Gentleman, but I must point out that subsection (4) does not mention the age of 12. It refers to any child.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, any child can consent. That is absolutely right. I was trying to distinguish the previous position under which a child could not give that capacity to a doctor. Any child can give that right. At present, there is a built-in legal presumption for those who can give capacity—that they give the right to a responsible Physician who carries out an operation which he regards as in the patient's interests. That is a presumption of all professional relationships and is a built-in presumption of the common law. I am glad that the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) is reassured and that the matter is made absolutely plain to the medical profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
In response to the matter by the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow, I should say that, in general, the provision would cover any medical attention—forget dental attention for the moment—in other words, any remedial interference with the mind or body by a person who is trained so to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me back to the appallingly difficult problem of those whom, for some reason, the hon. Gentleman called people of strange Christian belief. I prefer the word "religious"; it does not seem to me that those who say that their child should die rather than be saved fall within any concept of Christian doctrine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not say that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can only say,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do."</p></blockquote>
We must be clear about the matter. Suppose that a parent is so fanatical that he requires his child to take drugs, to act out fantasies, not go to hospital, or whatever. If the parent has such control of the child, no statute can do anything to prevent the consequences—alas. It is terrible, but no statute could order a parent whose child was suffering from intense migraine to take that child to hospital. That, I regret, is a fact.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman is right on that. But suppose that a child is knocked down in the street by a car and is taken by ambulance to hospital. I think that, in those circumstances, there would be an opportunity for doctors treating that child to ensure that treatment was given, even if the parents arrived and said, "No. We do not want our child to be treated."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a matter of medical ethics; I believe that the doctor would carry on and say, in effect, "I am not interested in your views. I am in the operating theatre, operating. Good night." That, I believe, would be the normal, ethical response of most responsible physicians.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Devlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Physicians do not operate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In an emergency, a doctor will operate, regardless of consent. If a child has been knocked down and is unconscious, it is plain that the child cannot consent. The doctor will not telephone the parents to say, "By the way, do you consent to my trying to save your child?" In an emergency, he will act automatically on his own best judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may put the reverse position. This is an important point for the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, as he raised the principle. If a parent consents to the castration of his child, it does not mean that a medical practitioner is under any obligation to carry that out. The Bill makes it absolutely clear that a doctor can treat a child who consents to the treatment. However, no wish by a guardian or parent for treatment to be carried out on a child can put an obligation on a physician or practitioner to carry out what he does not believe is in the best interests of the child.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer to circumstances in which parents do not want certain treatment to be carried out on their child. Let us suppose that a girl wishes to take the pill against her parents' wishes. If the parents exercise their
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
parental right, I understand that, under the law, the doctor is under no obligation to accept their wishes if he decides that it is in the girl's medical interests for the pill to be prescribed. Will that still apply under the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman for raising that matter. As he knows, I founded the birth control clinics in Scotland. Parents' wishes will have no effect if the doctor believes that it is in the best interests of the child that certain treatment—contraceptive or otherwise—should be prescribed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 7, in page 4, line 28, leave out '16' and insert '12'.

No. 8, in page 4, line 31, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(b) any reference in any rule of law, enactment or document to the curatory of a minor child shall be construed as a reference to the curator or, as the case may be, curatory of a person of or over the age of 12 years but under the age of 18 years; and accordingly the curator of such a person shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, have in relation to him and his estate the powers and duties which, immediately before such commencement, a curator had in relation to a minor'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I promise that I shall be brief. We have had the sort of debate that I sought to initiate through my amendments. I seek from the hon. and learned Gentleman a defence of clause 5, as I consider that amendment No. 4, in conjunction with amendment Nos. 7 and 8, would strengthen the provision. The Bill will reduce the status of minority and will reduce the status of children under 16 to that of pupils. The amendment would preserve the status of minority and would standardise it at the age of 12 for boys and girls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Understandably, the Bill will replace the old terminology of "tutor" and "curator" when referring to guardians. My amendment would preserve the old terminology, not becasue such descriptions are essential but because they reflect a difference in the nature of guardianship in relation to older and younger children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I promised that I would speak briefly to the amendments, and I now seek from the hon. and learned Gentleman a defence of the clause or perhaps a courteous acceptance of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer to the late Tarn Galbraith who, members of the Committee may remember, got into some difficulty with a man from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, a Mr Vassall. He said in the Chamber not long after I was elected that feu duty was only brought into disrespect by using such terms as "landlord" and "vassal". The concept of tutelage and pupillage, which arises from Justinian's "Corpus Juris Civilis" and the works of Gaius, is somewhat inappropriate to present-day teenagers.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
The amendment would reverse what we are attempting to achieve by the Bill. A child entering into a transaction is already protected, regardless of its age. A child can buy sweets, for example, but it could not buy a tenement in New York, without its guardian's consent. After the age of 16, a child can enter into any transaction, subject to the protection of 	<i>enorm lesion</i>—I thought that the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) would remember that term. The person can disengage himself from a contract for a fixed period if the transaction is one into which an adult would not have entered, it is seen to be unfair or if 	<i>enorm lesion</i> can be shown.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was thought appropriate to subject 15-year-olds and those who are younger to guardianship to protect them from the harsh realities of the commercial world, subject to their capacity to undertake what they would be expected to contract for and subject to their being able to make a will or consenting to their own adoption. I believe that the amendment would contradict that simple principle, while the Bill is trying to simplify the principle of contractual responsibility among those who are growing up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, on the basis of the hon. and learned Gentleman's response to my remarks, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 12, in page 4, line 37, leave out subsection (3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful if the hon. and learned Gentleman explained why he would be unwilling to accept the amendment, given the paragraph in the notes on clauses which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Under the scheme, a person below the age of 16 would, generally speaking, have no capacity to act on his own behalf. Subject to a few exceptions, all transactions would have to be entered into by his parent of guardian."</p></blockquote>
Subsection (3) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As from the commencement of this Act, no person shall, by reason of age alone, be subject to the curatory of another person."</p></blockquote>
I ask the hon. and learned Gentleman to defend the Bill as it stands or to accept my amendment with his customary courtesy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the present, archaic system is to be removed, it seems sensible that it should be removed at once. If subsection (3) were left out, there would be a lingering pupillarity and minority that would continue for children until they came within the scope of the Bill. That would be farcical and it would create three classes of persons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always said that there are only three classes of people who die—those who die peacefully, suddenly or after a long illness bravely borne. I do not want the living to fall into the categories of minority, pupillarity and guardianship. If we are moving to guardianship, let us do so now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman) said that every child under the age of 16 would now become a pupil as opposed to a minor. Can the hon. and learned Gentleman clarify the position, because he shook his head when my hon. Friend made that point? My view is that we are creating a new category which is neither pupil nor minor but something different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman. Indeed, that is the position that we are creating. Children are children, subject to the capacities that I have outlined, until they are 16. Thereafter, they are full contractual adults, subject to enorm lesion if they can establish it. The hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) has probably gone to look that up because, being a Scottish Nationalist, he will not understand a term of Scottish law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are creating a point at which a child has contractual capacity in full and leaving the common law protections for children under that age.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the most helpful notes on clauses, a brief paragraph is entitled "Interpretation". It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Clause 9 is solely an interpretation provision. In particular it gives an inclusive definition of 'transaction', which is not however meant to be an exhaustive definition."</p></blockquote>
If the hon. and learned Gentleman were so gracious as to accept them, amendments Nos. 13 and 14 would limit the definition of "transaction" by removing two subsections. The aim is to restrict the Bill's application to contractual matters and it seems that subsections (f) and (g) are not relevant to the control over one's person.

I am sorry to say it again but, as is my right, I ask the hon. and learned Gentleman to defend clause 9 and to explain in his characteristic way why he cannot accept the amendments, even though they have been presented in such a brief and concise manner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am smarmy. It is one of my most noted characteristics. I have been a suck-up all my days: that is spelt with an "s", not with the old fashioned style of "s" that we used in the law of Scotland.

"Transaction" essentially means a legal transaction—a transaction having legal effect—which gives rise to a benefit or a disbenefit to the child who enters into it. The hon. Gentleman wants to remove subsections (c) to (g).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The exercise of a power of appointment is most important. A child may be orphaned and have to appoint a trustee or a curator bonus. That is much more important than buying a motor car. The hon. Gentleman doubtless agrees. I trust that this is a closed session and off the record, because solicitors are not necessarily the most reliable people when dealing with the interests of those who put their affairs in their hands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek an explanation. Is not a curator bonus appointed by a court to protect the interests of a person who is deemed not able to protect their own interests?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. It is a court appointment. However, if a court had reason to appoint a curator bonus, and the child had already selected a solicitor, the likelihood would be that the court would appoint the child's solicitor. The child would have influenced the court in its choice, which might not be in the child's interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The bringing or defending or taking of any step in civil proceedings comes under the same caution that adults are not good at choosing lawyers to act in their best interests. A child should be protected rather more from the same defaults. The giving of consent that has legal effect is in the same category. Acting as an arbiter or trustee is a more theoretical concept but, nevertheless, one that should be protected. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) is not present to explain what
	<br><blockquote><p>"acting as an instrumentary witness"</p></blockquote>
means, but as he and the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow clearly know, I shall not bother to explain it. I shall simply add that it is important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow wants to remove the relevant subsections. They concern transactions in which children under the age of 16 cannot take part, but at present those between 16 and 18 cannot take part in some of those transactions. For example, I believe that, at present, someone between 16 and 18 cannot act as an instrumentary witness. I presume that the term means that if a person draws up a will, he needs a witness, who is an instrumentary witness. Furthermore, at present, a person between 16 and 18 cannot act as an arbiter or trustee. Am I right in thinking that the Bill would allow people aged between 16 and 18 to act in those capacities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. There is a conflict of lunacy in the ages at which people are allowed to act in various capacities, or to watch films or to own certain possessions, but as we are dealing with a law that is based on the ability to conceive a child or to have intercourse at 12 or 14—the law now is that that is legal at 16—it seems odd that a person can consent to intercourse but cannot sign a deed to verify a signature. It is not a great departure from sovereignty to lower the age of an instrumentary witness from 18 to 16.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That might be true in relation to a person's signature, but I presume that the term means that the person can act as witness for anyone. For example, the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
next-door neighbour may be looking for someone to witness his will and, if he finds the parents out, he may ask the 16-year-old son or daughter. I presume that the Bill means that they could now act as witnesses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but the hon. Gentleman must be clear that the 16-year-old is witnessing only the signature. He is not endorsing the validity, content or purpose of the document. In the law of Scotland there are two ways of witnessing a signature: one is to write one's name in front of the witness, who then witnesses that the person wrote it; the other is to come along with one's signature and say, "That is my signature. Please witness it." The law of Scotland allows for a major fraud on the basis of the assumption that the witness accepts the truth that the person claiming the signature that is, or is not, his is his.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 15, in page 5, line 33, leave out from 'force' to end of line 34 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'on such date as the Secretary of State may by order made by statutory instrument appoint, and different days may be appointed for different provisions or for different purposes of the same provision'.</p></blockquote>
This amendment has a simple aim. It seeks to introduce flexibility into the bringing into force of the Bill. I shall listen closely and intently to the hon. and learned Gentleman's dismissal of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I first got into the House, I had the extraordinary misfortune to be put on the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments. Every week, a yard of statutory instruments was delivered to me. The duties of the members of that Committee were to ensure that every line and provision within each statutory instrument was intra vires of the Acts which authorised subsidiary legislation, to ensure that they were valid in terms of application and to ensure that they were comprehensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I had taken my duties seriously—and I have never been foolish enough to do that—it would have taken the rest of my life to go through all the statutes and check whether each asinine application of each instrument was valid under the Food Regulations Act 1943, the Confectionery Sales Act, the Shops Act, the Sales Act and so on. I am against subsidiary legislation in principle. This is a simple Bill which introduces a simple proposition to bring the law of Scotland out of the fourth century. There is no need for it to be delayed or altered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman was quite right not to go into the statutory instruments too far. Apparently, the present Chairman of the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments frequently reads them to see whether they are intra vires and comprehensible. Even if they are not intra vires and he reports it to the House, the House and the Government pay no attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

He used to read the whole damn lot. I had a simple technique. I read each one until I found a fault in it. That was enough. It saved me much time.
