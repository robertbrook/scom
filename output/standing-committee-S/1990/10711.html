Fishing and Fish-farming in Scotland</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the matter of fishing and fish-farming in Scotland.</p></blockquote>
Fishing and fish-farming are rarely far from the top of the Scottish political agenda, and rightly so. They are important industries which make a sizeable contribution to the Scottish economy and are the life-blood of many of our coastal communities.<br><br>
The fishing industry currently employs more than 8,000 fishermen and more than £267 million worth of fish was landed into Scotland in 1990. That is backed up by a substantial fish-processing industry and by services such as boat-building. The Government are acutely aware that this is a difficult time for the Scottish fishing industry and those who depend on it. A run of poor year classes of cod and haddock, combined with continuing high levels of fishing pressure have led to a serious decline in those stocks; and that has inevitably affected those who fish mainly for those species.<br><br>
I am at a disadvantage in this debate because I do not have ministerial responsibility for this subject, but I know enough to recognise how difficult and intractable are the problems of the industry. My noble Friend the Minister with responsibility for agriculture and fisheries, who was at the latest Fisheries Council meeting earlier this week, is working hard to achieve a European solution on technical conservation. He has to achieve a proper balance between the short-term interests of present fishermen and the interests of their successors in another generation. In addition, we are not free agents in this area of policy and have to secure agreement in the European Community.<br><br>
All of that is difficult enough without the kind of outrageous attacks that we have witnessed recently, particularly from the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond). I am sure that all of us on the Conservative Benches would wish my noble Friend well in the negotiations that must continue in Brussels in the autumn. We can contrast his excellent efforts on behalf of the Scottish industry with the negative views expressed by the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alex Salmond <span class='memberconstituency'>(Banff and Buchan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister has been well briefed by Lord Caithness for this morning's proceedings. Will the Minister clarify whether it is true that the former Scottish Office Minister, Lord Sanderson of Bowden, presented a detailed proposal for a decommissioning scheme to a Cabinet committee in November 1989, only to have it shot down by the present Minister with responsibility for agriculture and fisheries? Is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2</span>
that true? If it is, will the Minister explain why the Scottish Office team has been arguing against decommissioning—living a lie—for the past 18 months?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is typical of the type of comment that we have come to expect from the hon. Gentleman. The hon. Gentleman would expect the Government to have considered all the proposals and representations on decommissioning that we have received over the years. That, of course, has happened. The Government have considered a decommissioning scheme and the collective view has been that such a scheme would not be appropriate. The Government's latest position, of which the hon. Gentleman is aware, is that we should be prepared to consider proposals from the fishing industry, which involved an industry contribution. That is a far more constructuve approach than the hon. Gentleman's own so-called five-point plan.<br><br>
Perhaps we could deal with that plan. The first point in that plan is the abolition of the eight-day tie-up rule. But that, of course, cannot happen; the tie-up is enshrined in Community law and we are in no position to change that policy. If the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan has his way and we had an independent Scotland, any representations that we made in the Fisheries Council would command all of three votes, whereas, as part of the United Kingdom, we have 10 votes and can argue for the interests of the Scottish fishing industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose—</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me deal with the hon. Gentleman's five-point plan first. His second point is to introduce an 80 mm square mesh panel for the white-fish fleet, but that would be illegal under Community law. We know from earlier discussions in the Scottish Fishermen's Federation on mesh proposals that an 80 mm square mesh is completely unsellable either to the Commission or to our European partners. The reason for that is simple. As with the need for the eight-day tie-up, other member states recognise perfectly well that we simply cannot sell out the fishing industry for the sake of short-term advantage. The hon. Gentleman knows that, but of course he does not, and never will, have the responsibility of office.<br><br>
The third point of the five-point plan is a European clampdown on industrial fishing. The Government agree that industrial fishing must be properly controlled and regulated, but we also need to bear it in mind that it is an important industry for Denmark—a country that we hear a great deal about from the Scottish National party and others. It will be interesting to know whether the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan will expect other member states of the Community to treat a small, independent Scotland in the cavalier way in which he considers treating Denmark, one of the smaller members of the Community.<br><br>
The fourth point of the so-called five-point plan proposes the introduction of a decommissioning scheme, which I shall consider later. The fifth point
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0228">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 3</span>
is that Scottish Enterprise should be used to win European funding for fish processors. It would seem that the hon. Gentleman does not know enough about the industry to realise that Scottish Enterprise is already helping, notably through the Aberdeen seafood project, and that Scottish fish processors have received £7 million in EC grants in the past five years. They will continue to receive substantial grants in the years ahead.<br><br>
Therefore, the five-point plan advanced by the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan is illegal, impractical, careless of conservation needs and based on ignorance of the true position. I do not believe that the fishing industry of Scotland will be fooled for one minute.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Norman A. Godman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Port Glasgow)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned the European Community earlier and I have a question about that and the European Free Trade Association. Have the EC negotiators sought any concessions from Norway and Iceland concerning access by EC fishing vessels to the Icelandic and Norwegian fishing grounds? I do not know about the industry, but that could be a bargaining counter to be used by negotiators to provide working fishing days for certain types of Scottish fishing vessels.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Interventions will have to be shorter than that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with that issue when I wind up. However, I share the hon. Member's concern about the importance of the negotiations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that strong advertisement for a most excellent five-point plan for the fishing industry. Does the Minister agree that the Scottish industry would do far better with three votes in the Council of Ministers used to argue for the industry as opposed to 10 votes used to argue against it? If the Minister wants the industry to publish details of a decommissioning scheme—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I intend to call the hon. Member to speak, and I have already told the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman) that his intervention was too long. The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) should come to the point so that the Minister can reply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Government want the industry to commit itself to a decommissioning scheme, will the Minister publish the 1989 Government proposals to help the industry in its submission?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is an absolute scandal that an hon. Member who represents a fishing constituency is unable to defend his five-point plan, which I dismissed as illegal, impractical and careless of conservation needs. His contribution to the debate is to concentrate on what might have happened in the Government in 1989. The Scottish nationalists have nothing to say on the issue, other than to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
champion a populist view that is not in the long-term interests of the industry.<br><br>
The issues facing the fishing industry today include key issues such as effort limitation, selective fishing gear and fleet structure. I want to bear in mind the broader context of European fisheries management and conservation, and, in particular, the issues arising from the mid-term review of the common fisheries policy—the CFP—which is taking place between now and the end of 1992. The Government have taken the lead within Europe on conservation of fish stocks and my noble Friend fights resolutely for the interests of the Scottish fishing industry.<br><br>
The CFP was agreed in January 1983 after protracted discussions and endless council meetings. I pay tribute to the role in those negotiations of my right hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside. (Mr. Buchanan-Smith). I know that he would have liked to be here today and I am sure that the Committee wishes him a speedy recovery from his recent period in hospital.<br><br>
The Government achieved their two main objectives in the negotiations—restricting access to our inshore waters and securing a high share of the fish for United Kingdom fishermen. That affects Scottish fishermen especially as they take 75 per cent of the United Kingdom catch. Some member states believe the United Kingdom was too successful in the negotiations and we must defend our position against periodic attempts to chip away at what we achieved in 1983. The CFP was designed to apply for 20 years until 2002 with a limited mid-term review in 1992. The only aspects of the policy which the European Community is committed to review next year are access to coastal waters and the north of Scotland box.<br><br>
The main issues that the review will cover are already becoming clear. A communication from the European Commission at the end of last year coincided with the Government's analysis of the position. The basic framework of the CFP is sound. The arrangements on access to fisheries and the relative stability that underlines the allocation of quotas have served the Community well and should be retained.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Wallace <span class='memberconstituency'>(Orkney and Shetland)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am startled to hear that the north of Scotland box will be considered during the 1992 review. I do not expect the Minister to give away the Government's bargaining and negotiating position, but will he state the general direction in which he wants to see changes made to the north of Scotland box? Does he accept that if the 1983 arrangements were designed as conservation measures, they are not very effective as the number of licences allowed for the box greatly exceeds the number of vessels fishing there? There has been a tightening up in the number of vessels allowed—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have already told the Committee that such interventions are too long. I intend to call the hon. Member to speak after the Minister.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0229">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your protection, Mr. Hogg. The hon. Gentleman is correct—local fishermen would like the area of the Shetland box to be extended and the number of vessels allowed to fish in it reduced. We shall consider that idea sympathetically.<br><br>
The United Kingdom will hold the presidency of the Council of Ministers during the second half of 1992 when the review reaches a critical stage. The Government will try to bring the review to a successful conclusion with a stronger CFP to take us through the following 10 years.<br><br>
The present rules largely restrict access to waters within 12 miles of the United Kingdom to United Kingdom fishermen, except where there are historic rights of access by other member states. The system of total allowable catches and quotas provides a mechanism for establishing the shares of each stock that each member state is to receive each year through the principle of relative stability, which safeguards the United Kingdom share of the stocks. In addition, the Hague preference arrangement recognises the importance of fishing to the northern part of the United Kingdom, including Scotland and Ireland.<br><br>
The setting of quotas, however, is meaningless unless adequate arrangements are in place to ensure that those quotas are adhered to. The Commission communication has recognised that in most member states, the level of enforcement of fisheries rules must be improved. The United Kingdom was singled out as the only member state putting adequate resources into the surveillance of fishing activities; but we must not be complacent about that. In Scotland, our fisheries protection services was reorganised into an agency in April this year. It has been set clear performance targets, which should lead to greater efficiency through better co-ordination of enforcement services at sea, on land, and in the air. We will be pressing to ensure that all member states meet their obligation to enforce the fisheries regulations.<br><br>
The basic conservation problems facing the Scottish industry are common across the European Community. Fishing pressure on most stocks is too high, and too few fish are being left in the sea. That is hopeless short-termism, which totally ignores the interests of future generations of fishermen.<br><br>
The first strand to a conservation policy must be to make fishing gear more selective so that juvenile fish escape. My noble Friend the Minister has been taking a leading role within the Community in pressing for urgent measures on this. We are faced on the one hand with Commission proposals that are so extreme that very few fish would be caught at all. On the other hand, there are a few member states who are opposed to any meaningful progress on conservation. My noble Friend and other ministerial colleagues have been building an alliance with other member states who see, as we do, that action on conservation is necessary. We have persuaded them of the merits of the introduction of the square mesh panel and they agree the case for a moderate increase in mesh size. The Commission's proposals for 110 or 120 mm mesh are totally unacceptable.<br><br>
In view of the enormous importance to our fishermen of some of the stocks we have taken
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
unilateral action meantime by requiring our larger fishing vessels which go after cod, haddock and whiting to incorporate a 90 mm square mesh panel into their nets, which will result in a great many small fish surviving which would otherwise have been caught, and then thrown back into the sea dead. That is an important step towards conserving the stocks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister deal with safety at sea, which is extremely important? Many hon. Members from Scottish constituencies want to debate it. Will the Minister reach that issue today?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be happy to respond to any specific points about safety that the hon. Gentleman makes in the debate. If the hon. Gentleman is referring to the undertakings that I made to the House about the tie-up rule I am happy to reiterate what I said—boats returning to port that are prevented by bad weather from so doing will be considered sympathetically on the grounds of safety considerations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must allow me to proceed with my speech. So far I have concentrated on current negotiations in the EC and the problems of maintaining the fishing industry while maintaining an effective conservation policy at the same time.<br><br>
The second element of conservation must be to reduce the amount of fishing done in pursuit of pressure stocks. The eight-day tie-up is a crude expedient, but necessary to meet the crisis that we are facing. I know that many fishermen do not like it, but swift action was necessary and many in the industry are now coming to accept that. We were able to ameliorate the effect of the eight-day tie-up on fishermen by negotiating with the Commission for the option of allowing them to use 110 mm mesh nets instead. Some 150 Scottish vessels have taken up this option.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brian Wilson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cunninghame, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister is aware that the Scottish Fishermen's Federation is disappointed by the fact that some of us members have taken up the mesh option as an alternative to the eight-day tie-up. Briefly, at this stage, will the Minister assure us that the take-up of that option will be monitored as closely as adherence to the eight-day tie-up? There should be no question of one group of fishermen being the winners.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not entirely sure what the hon. Gentleman is getting at. However, I assure him that those who adopt the gear option will be closely monitored to ensure that they obey the rules.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Exactly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that that might have been what the hon. Gentleman was implying. He was suggesting that people might appear to be taking
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0230">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
advantage of the gear option without fishing in a proper manner with 110 mm nets. I assure him that the rules will be enforced. Fishermen who cheat will have that net option removed, and they will have to operate under the eight-day tie-up.<br><br>
The take-up is encouraging, and my noble Friend the Minister deserves considerable credit for negotiating the option with his ministerial colleagues. In the longer term, we are talking with the Commission and our Community partners about a strategy for reducing fishing mortality. The immediate reaction from some quarters is to propose a decommissioning scheme. By popular request I shall clarify the Government's position on that matter.<br><br>
We accept that there is surplus capacity in the United Kingdom's fishing fleet. However, we are not persuaded that a grant-aided decommissioning scheme would be either the best way in which to tackle the problem or that it would be an effective way of doing so. However, we do not have a closed mind on the issue. [<i>Laughter.</i>] Hon. Members will no doubt be delighted to hear that. We will be prepared to consider a decommissioning scheme if it is part of an appropriate conservation package, and provided that the industry itself is prepared to make a contribution.<br><br>
When I say that decommissioning is not, in our view, the best way in which to tackle overcapacity, I have two points in mind. First, we cannot overlook the serious criticisms made by the Public Accounts Committee of the previous decommissioning scheme. I accept that those criticisms were particular to the details of that scheme. Nevertheless, it is bound to be difficult to ensure good value for money in such expenditure. The appropriate size of the fleet and, therefore, the appropriate level to which it should be reduced, is a moving target that will depend on the level of fish stocks at a particular time, the prices they bring and the input costs that go into catching them. The Government are not best placed to take decisions of that kind although the EC does attempt to prescribe desirable fleet sizes through its so-called multi-annual guidance programme.<br><br>
When I said that I was not persuaded that decommissioning would be effective, I had in mind that under the present system of full pressure-stock licences, we could easily spend a lot of money decommissioning a number of vessels only to discover other fishermen fishing more intensively with the remaining vessels. Those other fishermen would, of course, secure a better economic reward—I acknowledge that. However, the pressure on the fish stocks would not be correspondingly reduced. Before we attempt to embark on decommissioning, we need to be a lot more confident that that would not happen.<br><br>
Finally, it does seem not unreasonable to ask the industry to contribute to any decommissioning scheme since the benefits of the scheme would, of course, accrue to the remaining part of the industry in the form of enhanced fish stocks and better catches in future years.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dumfries)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend make it clear what he means by the phrase, "ask the industry to contribute"? Does he mean a contribution to conservation or a financial contribution?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I mean that the industry should pay. The industry will be the principal beneficiary, and it is not therefore unreasonable that the costs of the scheme should come, at least in part, from it.<br><br>
I know that at least some hon. Members have the best interests of the fishing industry at heart. I must tell them that that offer to the industry is genuine. If the industry is prepared to fund a decommissioning scheme that requires a contribution from the Government, that scheme will be considered. The Government's view is that the industry's contribution should reflect the considerable interest and benefit that would accrue to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: What proportion of the scheme does the Minister envisage should be contributed by the industry?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall say again, for the benefit of the hon. and learned Gentleman, that we are prepared to consider a scheme that has been devised by the industry itself. The Government would expect the industry to contribute towards the cost of that scheme. We think that the industry would be the principal beneficiary and we would, therefore, expect it to be the principal source of funding. Because no specific scheme has been outlined, it is difficult for me to express a view on its merits. The hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Campbell), who is a member of the Liberal Democrats party has been quoted in the newspapers, under his own name—and even on the radio this morning—as suggesting that the Government have not responded to schemes from Shetland fishermen. Such schemes have simply not come to the Scottish Office. If the industry is serious, the opportunity exists for the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, its representative body, to propose a scheme which my noble Friend the Minister, as he has repeatedly made it clear, will be happy to consider.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs Margaret Ewing <span class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister give us some idea of the proportion that he would ask the industry to pay? If the fishermen are being asked to make proposals, they should at least have some clear guidelines from the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Two factors are important. First, because the industry is one of the principal beneficiaries, we would expect that to be reflected in the scheme. Second, the Government's involvement would be determined by the extent of the conservation package and conservation benefits that would accrue from the scheme. That is a clear invitation and a clear opportunity. I suggest that people's energies be directed towards being positive, rather than towards trying to score points against a Government who are committed to the long-term future of the industry.<br><br>
On the subject of fish-farming—</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister leaves the subject of fishing, he must surely deal with safety at sea. The Select Committee on Defence has severely criticised the Government's delay in testing the transponders that would help to protect fishing boats from the danger of submarines. Will the Minister take that matter up immediately with the Ministry of Defence, and try to get some action on it? Will he cover the question of safety at sea in this important debate?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All members of the Committee were, I am sure, deeply saddened by the loss of the Antares and her crew. It was a terrible tragedy. The hon. Gentleman will know—or if he does not, he will in a moment—that trials are under way on an underwater bleeper that is attached to fishing nets and which warns submarines of the nets' presence. Following a review, the warning arrangements in the Clyde were extended from 1 June to the Clyde submarine exercises line, either wholly or partially within the United Kingdom 12-mile limit. I think that the hon. Gentleman is aware of that. If there are any specific points that he wishes to make, he can make them in his own speech and I shall happily respond the them when I wind up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Godman</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will allow me to make progress, I am sure that he will no doubt be able to catch your eye later, Mr. Hogg.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Godman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I doubt it very much.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, I cannot take responsibility for those matters. I have quite enough on my plate this morning.<br><br>
Salmon farming, with fish-farming generally, has been a great success story in Scotland, with the production of up to 32,000 tons last year and a first-sale value of well over £100 million. More than a third of the production is sold overseas. More than 2,000 jobs have been created directly, with a multiplier of two or three in related industries. The special significance of the industry is the opportunity that it brings to remote areas.<br><br>
I do not want to dwell on the subject at length, as I have recently gone over that ground in response to an Adjournment debate initiated by the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs Michie). The problem is clearly understood. The industry is threatened by a market that has faltered, by problems of disease among the fish and by Norwegian overproduction of salmon, which has led to allegations of dumping by Norway on to EC markets. As I said in the recent Adjournment debate to the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute, the Norwegian Government appeared to have taken effective action and prices recovered during 1990.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs Ray Mitchie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll and Bute)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister tell the Committee exactly who is responsible for the salmon fishing industry in Scotland? Is it the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food; is it the Secretary of State for Scotland
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
or is it his noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland? The farmers are puzzled. If the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is responsible, why was the issue not on the formal agenda at the recent Fisheries Council meeting?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suppose that there is a rule in the House never to ask a question unless one knows the answer. I am sure that the hon. Lady is aware of the position. There is a whole range of areas of policy which affects the fishing industry. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) has responsibilities for planning and I understand that he may make a statement on that in the near future. My noble Friend, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary, also takes a keen interest in the industry. It is also true that, on occasions, the Scottish Office and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food work together. The issue of dumping is the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. I assure the hon. Lady that the Government are committed to fight for the interests of the industry.<br><br>
The Norwegian Government appeared to take effective action and prices of salmon recovered during 1990. However, prices have recently fallen to the levels that gave rise to the anti-dumping case in 1989. As I reported to the House recently, the Norwegians have now taken some steps to control supplies and future output, including the financing of new withdrawals from the market and the destruction of large numbers of smolts this year. However, they do not appear to have achieved effective operation of their minimum price system, and prices are still being undermined by consignments of salmon, arriving on the French market particularly, at prices that are inconsistent with the Norwegians' own minimum prices.<br><br>
We are doing our best to deal with the problem as effectively and as quickly as possible, although hon. Members must recognise that—as with sea fisheries' interests—we must operate through the EC. Discussions took place in Brussels this week and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry raised the matter with members of the Commission during meetings in Strasbourg on Tuesday.<br><br>
We have now received the long-awaited evidence from the Scottish Salmon Growers Association and that is now being examined by the Government and by the Commission.<br><br>
The salmon-farming industry is of real importance to Scotland and we shall continue to exercise pressure until we have achieved a satisfactory resolution to the recent problems.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston <span class='memberconstituency'>(Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: There have been rumours that the reason that we have not clamped down on dumping by Norway is because the issue has been mixed up with trade-offs in fishing in the advance negotiations about Norway's possible entry into the Community. Can the Minister assure us that that is not true?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0232">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Gentleman that the Government are fighting hard for the interests of the industry. I can also assure him that—as with conservation issues—those matters are subject to negotiation and we have to obtain agreement with our partners. The Government will always fight for the interests of the industry overall.<br><br>
There are many serious issues facing the fishing and fish-farming industry in Scotland, but we should not forget that there has been some good news for the industry. The total value of fish landings into Scotland in the first five months of the year was 8 per cent higher than in 1990. Prices for cod and haddock rose by 11 per cent. Even in areas where conservation is a top priority, we have obtained preferential quotas in EC negotiations through the use of the Hague preference arrangement, which has given well over 80 per cent of the EC quota of available haddock to the north and west of Scotland.<br><br>
There is less pressure on the stocks of some pelagic species such as herring and mackerel and the increasing publicity about the health benefit of eating those species is expanding the market for them. The salmon farming industry has been one of the major successes of recent years and continues to make a significant contribution to the rural economy. While parts of the fish-processing industry are suffering from the shortage of supplies of cod and haddock, we have seen considerable new investment in processing facilities for salmon, herring and mackerel. Our processors are increasingly turning to value-added products where, in the past, they have simply undertaken primary processing.<br><br>
We have a vibrant fishing and fish-farming industry in Scotland, which demonstrates the very best entrepreneurial spirit. In the difficult negotiations in Europe in the coming months the Government will be fighting hard on behalf of those industries to secure the best possible deal for them.</span></p>
<p>11.6 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister regrets that when the Scottish Office was having a trawl through the Department to find out who would speak in this debate, the mesh size was not big enough for him to slip through. Nevertheless, we thank the Minister for that spirited opening.<br><br>
Interventions can sometimes lead to speeches being cut short, but some of the Minister's answers were not quite as satisfactory as we would have hoped. My Liberal Democrat colleagues and I have been pushing for this debate for more than a year. The regret is not so much the delay as the fact that the problems of the fishing industry—and now the fish-farming industry—are so much to the fore.<br><br>
The Minister was right to point to some of the successes of the fish-farming industry. The industry has gone from a relatively small base in 1980 to one with an output of £140 million with 6,300 dependent jobs. As the Minister rightly pointed out, jobs are dependent on that industry in areas where otherwise the economy tends to be rather fragile. A letter sent to my hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir Russell Johnston) by Glendale
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
Salmon Ltd. stated that that company provided six full-time jobs only and that
<br><blockquote><p>"at our particular location, we are the largest employer in an area which is otherwise devoted to crofting. For these jobs to disappear would be a tragedy".</p></blockquote>
That underlines the crisis that is facing the industry as a result of the allegations, largely proved, of dumping Norwegian salmon on the market, which inevitably puts pressure on the industry.<br><br>
This matter was gone into in some depth in the debate initiated by my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs Michie) and, like the Minister, I do not see much point in going over the same ground. However, we can take the matter on from there because, since Christmas, the industry has given the Scottish Office a regular weekly price information service and examples from France and Spain of 20 per cent price changes—such a change was sufficient for the Commission to mount an inquiry in 1989. It should be remembered that that Commission inquiry found the allegation substantiated. The tragedy was that the British Government could find only one other national Government who were prepared to support them in the Council of Ministers to adopt the 11.4 per cent tariff which had been proposed by the Commission to tackle the problem.<br><br>
I shall not make points about the lack of credit that the Government may have in the Council of Ministers. However, as the Minister said in a reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll and Bute, dumping is dealt with by the Department of Trade and Industry and is a trade matter involving fish, rather than a fishing matter. I suspect the extent to which those who dealt with that matter were aware of the vital importance of this industry to Scotland, and especially to the highlands and islands. I do not see why we should be bound up with institutional arrangements when we are dealing with an industry as critical to Scotland as this one. I do not see why the Scottish Office should not deal with dumping in the European Community. If the Minister wants to clarify the point, I shall give way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman misrepresents what I said. I was asked which Departments had responsibility and I pointed out that the DTI had a responsibility. Only this week my right hon. Friend raised the issue with the EC Vice-President Andriessen and with Commissioner MacSharry. My noble Friend the Minister raised it at the meeting of the Fisheries Council. There is no question of the Scottish Office and its Ministers not pursuing the matter through every avenue in the Community.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, but he misses the point about the critical meeting in the Council of Ministers to determine whether tariffs should be imposed as part of an anti-dumping package. The responsibility lies with the DTI, not with any of the other Departments to which the hon. Gentleman referred.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber asked whether the matter had not been pursued as seriously as it might have been because of EC and EFTA discussions, not least with regard
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0233">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
to Norway's possible application to join the Community. It would be deplorable if the salmon-farming industy in Scotland was traded off in that way.<br><br>
The Minister, in common with me, is a firm believer in free trade, but I am sure that he also believes in fair trade. The suspicion is that what we have now is not fair trade. While we accept that there is monitoring, that assurances have been sought and steps taken, the day-to-day reality in the industry is that prices are low and that is putting it under pressure.<br><br>
In the past when the EC has acted, it has acted slowly, and even then we could not get a guarantee about the action to be taken. Now the salmon prices are undercutting those of trout. Perhaps the Minister can gather a better coalition of other member states such as Spain, Germany and Italy, which all have trout industries, to prompt the introduction of a safeguard mechanism that can be used at short notice to impose a tariff where there is clear evidence of dumping.<br><br>
In the longer term the Minister should consider the integration of farmed salmon into the common fisheries policy, in particular the establishment of a reference price and the recognition of producer organisations. I am sure that he agrees that a wide fluctuation of prices cannot be in the best interests of the industry—producers and processors. If some long-term steps could be taken to ensure greater stability, they would be welcomed by the industry.<br><br>
The role of the Crown estate commissioners has plagued the fish-farming industry from its outset. I have been fortunate in my constituency because the Shetland islands council and the Orkney islands council have been more responsible for granting works licences than the Crown estate commissioners, but I am well aware of the problems that have occurred in other areas where those commissioners have been principally responsible for laying down planning conditions.<br><br>
Back in the 18th century it was never intended that the Crown estate commissioners should be a planning authority. It would be far better if an adapted Shetland model was adopted, whereby local planning authorities undertook the environmental and planning considerations and, when they granted a works licence, the Crown estates commissioners would be obliged to grant the lease—if they should have a role at all. The rents that they charge are extravagent—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs Margaret Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Rachmanite.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I agree. As landlords they put little or nothing into the industry and yet take a substantial amount out of it. That has not escaped the attention of many, not least the Select Committee on Agriculture, which pointed out that money was going to the Treasury via the Crown estate from areas that the Treasury was trying to help through bodies such as Highlands and Islands Enterprise. We are in a ridiculous position in which the Government are sucking money out of fragile areas because of the anachronistic role of the Crown estate
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
commissioners. A thorough review of their role is long overdue.<br><br>
Not enough is done in this country to co-ordinate research or to apply it, as happens in, for example, Norway. Much needs to be done to find alternatives to substances such as Nuvan to combat sea lice. Research is also required into scope for diversification in the production of new farm species such as halibut and turbot. I hope that the Minister, who has a constituency interest in aquatic research, will be prepared to see the Government taking a stronger role in bringing together private and public bodies engaged in aquaculture research and helping to indentify priorities.<br><br>
My final point on salmon farming relates to the role of HIE. My hon. Friend the Member for Argyll and Bute asked, in her Adjournment debate, about the discriminatory way in which HIE seems to hand out grants and give assistance. She was told that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stuart) would reply. I do not attribute any blame for the fact that the reply has not come yet, but I know that my hon. Friend awaits it with interest.<br><br>
The Shetland Salmon Farmers Association has complained to me about advertisements such as that sponsored by the Scottish Salmon Board, with funding assistance from the HIE, which has the slogan:
<br><blockquote><p>"No other salmon is up to the mark".</p></blockquote>
It says that such advertisements undermine other ventures in the highlands and islands undertaken by those who are not members of the Scottish Salmon Board. It is quite deplorable that a public body is funding a promotion that undermines other activities in the highlands and islands. That is not necessarily accidental given the comments made in a recent letter to a salmon producer in Argyll from the chief executive of HIE.<br><br>
[MR. BILL WALKER <i>in the Chair.</i>]<br><br>
I welcome you to the chair, Mr. Walker. The letter states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Shetland continues to operate largely independently on marketing issues. We would like to see more farmers joining the SSB."</p></blockquote>
Over many years Shetland has developed a high quality control of its seafood products, both fishing and fish-farm products, which have a widely-held good reputation. It is wrong that that industry is not being supported as it should be by HIE. I hope that my words will prompt some action by the Government. It is wrong that public funds should help one section of the industry at the expense of the other.<br><br>
This is by no means our first debate on the fishing industry this session. Indeed, in my eight years in the House I have never known so many debates on it. There were two debates in the Chamber before Christmas, an Opposition day debate introduced by the Liberal Democrats in February and a debate on the eight-day tie-up in March which, thanks to the impressario efforts of the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond), became a box office success
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0234">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
in the north-east. The common feature of all those debates has been the agreement between right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the House with the single exception of those sitting on the Government Front Bench.<br><br>
I share the Minister's view that it is a matter of great regret that the right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) is not here today: had he been here I am sure that he would have made a valuable contribution. I join the Minister in sending him our good wishes for a speedy recovery.<br><br>
Although the Minister made some effort to clarify the situation he seemed, ultimately, to leave more confusion than there was at the beginning of the debate. He did not surprise me when he suggested that when one looked at the value of landings not much was amiss. We have heard that one before. The present Secretary of State used the same argument when he addressed the Committee on this subject in 1989. No one will challenge the fact that the value of landings is up. That was also brought out in the briefings sent to members of the Committee by Grampian regional council. However, the Minister is a good exponent of the free market. He knows that when prices rise it is usually because demand is outstripping supply. The effect of recent cuts in total available catches has led to a considerable fall in supply.<br><br>
Higher prices are not a solution to the problem, but a symptom of that problem. They are certainly not a recipe for inaction. Higher landing prices bring little relief to an already hard-pressed processing sector on which many land-based jobs depend. That sector may be said to have the worst of both worlds. It now has smaller quantities to process—51,000 boxes was the average weekly haddock allowance in 1988, but it is down to 13,000 boxes in 1991. There is a similar trend for cod and a higher price has been paid for that smaller throughput. In addition the industry faces substantial investment costs to meet new European Community and United Kingdom hygiene regulations.<br><br>
The Minister said recently that there have been worthwhile investments in salmon processing and in the pelagic sector. Such investment is welcome and necessary, especially in the pelagic sector where we are trying to retrieve ground that was lost as a result of the seven-year closure of the herring fishery. The warning coming from the white fish processing sector is that if we do not watch out, we are in danger of losing that sector and of having to rebuild it from the beginning, as happened with the pelagic sector.<br><br>
Mr. Milne of the Scottish Fish Merchants Federation wrote in a letter to colleagues:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is no exaggeration to say that the Scottish fish processors are facing the most difficult period since the end of World War II and the main clearing banks can readily provide the evidence for that statement."</p></blockquote>
Can the Minister tell us about the Government's attitude towards the white fish processing industry? Are they prepared to follow Spain and Portugal in assisting with the industry's investment costs resulting from the new hygiene regulations? If so, what will be the nature of that assistance? When
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
will the regulations be fully implemented? Will the industry play on a level playing field? Will some parts of the industry go ahead and invest, with all the costs involved, and the continuing investment payments, while others lag behind and enjoy the benefits of not having those additional burdens? The industry wants clear information about Government policy.<br><br>
Regarding the catching sector, the debate would serve a purpose if it flushed out the Government's policy and intentions on decommissioning and technical conservation measures. We have heard the Minister's contribution, but I am not sure whether we are much the wiser. I intended to quote newspaper reports to show how confused the industry is—which is not surprising given recent ministerial comment on the subject. Perhaps the industry needs to look carefully, as I am sure it will, at the report of the Minister of State's speech; it will see that all the confusions have been rolled into one there.<br><br>
A headline in the <i>Press and Journal</i> of 13 April states:
<br><blockquote><p>"No plans for scheme to cut UK fleet."</p></blockquote>
However, by 24 April, we were being told in <i>The Scotsman:</i>
<br><blockquote><p>"Lang tells fishermen he will consider decommission scheme."</p></blockquote>
On 10 May, in a report on the Scottish Tory party conference, the <i>Press and Journal</i> wrote:
<br><blockquote><p>"Hopes dashed on decommissioning".</p></blockquote>
By 11 May, after the Prime Minister's intervention, we were told that there was
<br><blockquote><p>"Hope for fishers as PM steps in."</p></blockquote>
On 25 May we were told:
<br><blockquote><p>"Pay up to get out, fishers are told."</p></blockquote>
A report stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"Fisheries Minister Mr. John Gummer, who led the team of Ministers at the meeting told the SSF that he did not like decommissioning on principle".</p></blockquote>
He made it clear that there would be no Government guarantee of funding in the future. Today we have heard that the Government might contribute in the future, the extent of that contribution is unknown.<br><br>
By 5 June Mr. Robin Chrystal of the Scottish White Fish Producers Association said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Mr. Gummer must get very dizzy twisting and turning as he does. There must be a fisheries policy somewhere but it is getting very difficult to determine any coherent effective policy which the Government has just now."</p></blockquote>
With all due credit to the Minister, he has tried to enlighten us today, but unfortunately he has left us more confused than when we began. I took careful note of what the Minister said. He used the word "contribution" and then the word "funding". There is a possibility of the Government giving a contribution to a scheme that, basically, the industry would fund. He ignored or avoided questions about the amount of that contribution.<br><br>
When my hon. Friends and I met Lord Strathclyde and asked him what the amount of contribution would be, he was disarmingly frank; he replied, "I don't know." In the light of what happened afterwards, we wondered whether he had not been told because clearly the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food does not know who Lord
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0235">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
Strathclyde is, and he added insult to injury by downgrading the title of the noble Lord from a region to a district when he described him as "Lord Caithness". Today the Minister attempted to answer the question, but still I do not know how things stand.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making mischief. It is perfectly clear—the responsibility falls on the industry to propose a decommissioning scheme. If such a scheme should propose that there are contributions from the industry, the Government will be prepared to consider it. In terms of Government involvement, the amount of conservation that will arise from the scheme will be one of the factors to be taken into account. There is a clear offer on the table. The hon. Gentleman, by saying that that is not the case, is making matters more difficult.</span></p>
<p>[MR. NORMAN HOGG <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree that there is an offer on the table. The industry knows that, but it is being blindfolded. The Government are giving the industry no clue about what they are looking for. The Minister says that it is up to the industry to come forward with a plan. That is not the view taken by all our EC partners—they have taken the initiative. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] What sort of decommissioning scheme would be acceptable? What do the Government want the industry to target? Have the Government any idea, or are they simply handing the matter over to the industry in the hope that it will come up with something?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for intervening in the hon. Gentleman's speech again, but he is making mischief. The Government are yet to be persuaded that a decommissioning scheme will tackle the conservation problem, which is the central problem. If the industry believes that it is possible to produce a decommissioning scheme which will tackle that problem, and which has industry support, we are prepared to consider it. It could not be clearer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister thinks that it could not be clearer. Conservation is important, and I shall discuss the technical conservation measures shortly.<br><br>
As the Minister rightly said, a decommissioning scheme would not necessarily lead to a reduction in the amount of fish caught. However, as he accepted, it would make the lives of those left in the industry much easier because the value of the catch would be shared among fewer people. Indeed, the Minister put that forward as an argument for the industry making a contribution. Decommissioning has never been seen principally as a conservation measure. It is designed to reduce the size and capacity of the fleet.<br><br>
In a speech in this Committee on 13 July 1989, the Minister's right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State—the then Minister of State—emphasised more than once the importance of reducing the catching capacity of the fleet to bring it into line with fishing effort. But how do the Government see such a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
reduction taking place? Do they simply hope that the industry will come up with a decommissioning scheme that might persuade them, or will they leave the matter to free-market forces, with those who cannot cope going to the wall?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In many ways the principle is much the same as in agriculture. We could consider this to be a set-aside at sea—a way of putting money into the industry and increasing conservation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I cannot hear the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We said, "Bring back Sir Hector."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One must always be cautious when comparing the fishing and farming industries. The hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro) has made a valuable point, to which the industry has drawn attention on a number of occasions. If the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food prosecuted the interests of fishermen with regard to decommissioning as much as he done those of farmers with regard to set-aside, many of the problems would not exist.<br><br>
I should like to refer to the technical conservation measures, which were the subject of last Monday's Council of Ministers meeting. The industry feels aggrieved at the Government's unilateral action in imposing the 90 mm diamond panel with the 90 mm square mesh panel. It feels that if that were imposed on a Community-wide basis, it would be much more acceptable. It also feels that there should be a derogation for smaller vessels with an 80 mm square mesh panel and that compensation should be paid to all fishermen for losses in the marketable value of the fish that they would catch.<br><br>
The Minister tried to make mischief with the proposals from the hon. Members for Banff and Buchan. However, I am sure that that hon. Gentleman is more than capable of defending himself. It was not valid to argue that that five-point plan would be illegal and against EC law. As matters stand, that is true, but surely one of the Government's functions in the Community is to try to change the law if they consider that it is not working for them. The plan might not be illegal if the Minister achieved a sufficient coalition of interests, with 10 votes, to try to change the law.<br><br>
I took up the eight-day tie-up rule with Lord Strathclyde who replied that it resulted from a EC decision and that he can do nothing about it. He could do something. For example, many vessels have to spend one day sailing back from the port where they landed their fish to their home port. That does not count as a tie-up day, yet it is a day of non-fishing. If the political will existed to press the matter, the Community might agree to flexibility in that respect. My hon. Friend the Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) and I raised this matter with the commissioner—it did not seem to

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
give him any headaches. My hon. Friend might wish to comment on that meeting. Such flexibility did not appear to be an insuperable problem to the commissioner. It is a small matter but of great importance to those who are caught up in the hardline interpretation of the rules.<br><br>
The industry is despondent because, from what it has gleaned about what happened on Monday, it is not clear that the British Government are trying to force the issue of square mesh panels as much as the industry would wish. Some of the debriefings seemed to imply that, in the end, we might be unable to persuade the Commission to agree to a square mesh panel.<br><br>
The industry first proposed the square mesh panel as a serious technical conservation measure about two years ago. The industry believes that it would make an important contribution. To their credit, the Government have taken up the issue and have argued it with the Commission. However, it is disappointing if the signals now being received are that the Government are not pushing the issue as much as they might in an effort to persuade our Community partners.<br><br>
The industry perhaps feels aggrieved because it has been left all the sticks. The eight-day tie-up rule was unilaterally imposed as was the 1990 net rule. Yet, it has none of the carrots; it does not have a decommissioning scheme and it does not receive the compensation that several other EC countries pay to their fishermen who suffer as a result of the changes. When my hon. Friend the Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire and I met Senor Marin he said, in effect, that such matters are on the table and it is up to the United Kingdom Government to take them up. Up to date, they have not done so.<br><br>
We need clearer guidance about what the Government seek from technical conservation measures when they say that there is an offer on the table—it is perfectly fair to say that there is such an offer. The Minister did not give clear guidance about the kind of factors that would make up a satsifactory package—although this is not the place to negotiate such matters. If a package of technical conservation measures were proposed that did not include a tie-up period, would the United Kingdom Government be prepared to accept that and to argue in the EC that the tie-up period should be withdrawn?<br><br>
The Minister said that he did not know what the Shetland Fishermens Association's proposals were. My hon. Friends and I who met Lord Strathclyde a week past Monday had no doubt that Lord Strathclyde knew. I recall that he made some favourable comments about the secretary of the Shetland Fishermens Association, Mr. John Goodlad. If the Minister so wishes, I shall give him a copy of some of the proposals at the end of our proceedings today.<br><br>
Some of the proposals tabled have been in the fishing press. One hopes that those in the Scottish Office read <i>Fishing News</i> and <i>Scottish Fishing Weekly.</i> At least the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the other place knew what was being talked about.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman really suggesting that proposals that the Scottish Office has learnt about in the newspapers constitute proper proposals sent to the Scottish Office? As the hon. Gentleman well knows, the Scottish Office has received no proposals directly. My colleagues and I have read about the proposals in the newspapers and read about the hon. Gentleman saying that the Scottish Office had not responded to them. If proposals from the industry were to come from the SFF, they would, of course, be looked at seriously.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is making a mountain out of a molehill. The point is that Lord Strathclyde knew what we were talking about. I was not asking for a formal response. I recall what I said to Lord Strathclyde well. Hon. Members who used to play hunt the thimble when they were children might remember saying, "Am I getting hot or am I cold?" I said to Lord Strathclyde that the Shetland Fishermens Association had put forward proposals and I asked whether it was getting hot, or whether it was still cold. Lord Strathclyde did not know.<br><br>
The Minister is right to say that an offer has been made, but there should be parameters on that offer so that when a response is given it is meaningful and not a shot in the dark. It is fair enough to say that, beyond decommissioning and a conservation package, the door is no longer shut and bolted. However, to put a padlock and a combination lock on that door and ask the industry to guess what the combination is is no way for the Government to treat such an important Scottish industry. Because of the crisis that the white-fish sector has gone through, the pelagic sector has sometimes been overlooked. I understand that there will be an increase in the total allowable catch for herring and mackerel. However, there is concern that United Kingdom fishermen will not benefit much from that unless there is a renegotiation of the EC deals with Norway. What is being done about that to provide greater flexibility of fishing east of 4 deg west? The negotiation with Norway this year for pelagic stocks is critical. I hope that we will not find ourselves again in the position where the EC civil servants initial a deal with the Norwegian Government which subsequently proves impossible for the European Council of Ministers to unscramble because it is offered on a take it or leave it basis.<br><br>
In relation to that, what about the designation of Lerwick as a landing and trans-shipping port for both herring and mackerel thoughout the year? There is nothing in the white fish industry that makes provision for, or stipulation that, seafish caught on the west coast must be landed on the west coast and may not go to an east coast port, or vice versa. It is an anomaly for that still to be the case for the landing of pelagic stocks. Certainly, with the fine new pelagic factory at Lerwick it would be welcome if more could be done to allow for the designation of Lerwick as a landing and trans-shipping port throughout the year.<br><br>
I shall conclude by reminding the Committee of the remarks made by the then Minister of State, who is now Secretary of State, when he spoke in a similar debate two years ago. He said:

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"There can be no doubt, therefore, that steps need to be taken to reduce the United Kingdom's fishing capacity. It is also clear that we need to devise arrangements so that future fishing capacity remains more closely aligned with fishing opportunities."</p></blockquote>
I am sure that everyone will say, "Hear, hear" to that. He continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"Specifying the problem is not difficult, but getting the right solution is not so easy."—</p></blockquote>
Most of us would agree with that—
<br><blockquote><p>"These issues are too complicated to be solved quickly and too important to be solved carelessly. Many approaches are possible, but all have disadvantages, some of them potentially serious, as well as advantages."—[<i>Official Report,</i> Scottish Grand Committee, 13 July 1989; C.56]</p></blockquote>
No one doubts that the problem is difficult but we would like to be reassured that the problems are not so difficult that the Government have found them too complicated to find a solution.</span></p>
<p>11.39 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brian Wilson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cunninghame, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can only venture to speculate that the confusion over the identity of the Scottish Office Minister with responsibility for these matters is based on the fact that things are in a position of transition. I understand that the Minister who is with us today has been lobbying heavily for these matters to be passed to the safe pair of hands of Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish who has experience of them.<br><br>
I congratulate the Liberal Democrats in initiating today's debate and, in particular, for extending it to include the equally hard-pressed fish farming industry. The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) represents a constituency in which both fishing and fish farming are of great importance. That was reflected in the commonsense remarks that he made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not a matter to which I would normally respond, but I cannot understand why the hon. Gentleman suggested that I was lobbying for any responsibilities to be moved. That is completely untrue, and I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his remark. I made the position clear in my speech—that my noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary has done a splendid job for the fishing industry in Scotland and will continue to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's normally vivacious sense of humour has deserted him. It is quite reasonable to remark upon the fact that Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish was formerly a Minister with responsibility for fisheries. As chairman of the Sea Fishing Industry Authority he has great experience of the subject and he is now clearly in the job market. I have no intention of withdrawing my remark—whether the Minister likes it or not. It is certainly possible that as a result of a fairly disastrous performance by Lord Strathclyde, such a development may not be entirely unwelcome in the few months that remain to the Government.<br><br>
The most depressing aspect of the Scottish sea fishing industry is reflected in the briefing that we received from the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, which seems to have nothing new to say:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"Month after month we are treading water while the crisis deepens, and in the absence of a decommissioning scheme the grim reaper of debt and bankruptcy takes its toll."</p></blockquote>
I recently visited the Aberdeen branch of the Scottish Fish Merchants Association with my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran). According to that association, Scottish fish processors are facing the most difficult period since the end of world war two.<br><br>
I spoke yesterday to Bob Allen, secretary of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, who is in despair about the failure of the European talks earlier this week. His members are affected not only by the iniquitous eight-day tie-up but by the unilateral action on mesh size imposed by the United Kingdom Government.<br><br>
Meanwhile no progress has been made towards adopting the conservation measure based on square mesh panels, which the SFF put on the table as providing an adequate basis for such conservation. The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland has already provided the Committee with detail about that, so I shall not waste any more time on it.<br><br>
On the west coast the price of prawns has plummeted this season—that is as much a matter of concern to me as it is to those on the east coast and the northern isles. It is part of a knock-on effect from events on the east coast. When the eight-day tie-up was introduced, some of the most powerful vessels from the north-east immediately turned their attention to non-quota stocks—especially of prawns, with huge catches going into cold storage. That had an extremely serious effect on the market. Thus the impact of ill-judged actions and inactions of the Government and the EC ripples around our fishing communities.<br><br>
At the root of many problems lies the Government's refusal to implement a decommissioning scheme, which would contribute to a rational restructuring of the fleet and a matching of catching effort to available stocks. Without that approach, we shall continue in the same atmosphere of crisis management. If there are insufficient stocks, Peter, in the guise of the weaker and less capital intensive fishery areas, will continue to be robbed to pay Paul. Decommissioning will continue in an utterly unselective manner with those without the greatest catching power having to give up or pull out.<br><br>
On 13 June the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Scotland wrote a letter to the chief executive of the Grampian region. Following the efforts of the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland to cover the twists and turns of this issue I shall quote from it:
<br><blockquote><p>"the Government is prepared to consider decommissioning, but only as part of a package which would tackle our current conservation problems, be realistic in terms of our commitments to the European Community, and be cost effective for the tax payer."</p></blockquote>
There is no mention there of the proposition that it should be paid for by the fishing industry. We could all agree on the basis of what was contained in the Scottish Office letter of 13 June. The letter appears to be excellent. Of course a decommissioning scheme should be part of a wider aproach to conservation and be cost-effective for the taxpayer. If those words
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0238">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
represented Government policy, we could make real progress, with all interested parties sitting around a table to work out the details. However, the salutary practical experience of discussing such matters with the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has demonstrated that those words are not worth the paper that they are written on. They are mere casuistry, as the Minister demonstrated again this morning when he emphasised the financial contribution to be made by the fishing industry towards any decommissioning scheme. The parallel, as the hon. Member for Dumfries rightly said, would be for the Minister to tell the Stirling branch of the National Fanners Union, "Of course you can have set-aside, but, sorry chaps, you will have to pay for it yourselves." I suspect that he would receive a very dusty response.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no parallel.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dumfries and I believe that there is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The parallel that the hon. Gentleman draws with set-aside is absurd. Set-aside was introduced to deal with surpluses. We are discussing shortage of fish in the North sea.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surpluses arise from surplus capacity and intensity of effort.<br><br>
One sad aspect is that when we debate agricultural issues we talk about farmers, but not enough about consumers. It is not a matter of satisfaction that the price of fish is being forced up, and out of the reach of people who most need that healthy and nutritional food. It is of no satisfaction that the price of white fish in the shops is higher than steak. That is neither good for the fishing industry, nor for the nation's health. I agree with the hon. Member for Dumfries that there is a parallel.<br><br>
I am pleased to give an undertaking that the incoming Labour Government will introduce a decommissioning scheme. We shall maintain that commitment to the fishing industry in the knowledge that British taxpayers are already contributing 75 per cent to the cost of decommissioning schemes. The problem is not the principle of decommissioning but the fact that the Government are so mean and shortsighted that they are prepared to squander taxpayers' money by contributing to schemes in every other Community country, except Ireland and, presumably, Luxembourg, yet fail to make the necessary relatively small contribution to introduce such a scheme in Scotland.<br><br>
I am not an uncritical admirer of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, but the reasonableness of its approach on this matter is absolute. It is not asking the Government to give details of a decommissioning scheme; only for the principle to be accepted, and for the details then to be negotiated open-mindedly around a table.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman made the policy statement that a Labour
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
Government, if and when they were elected, will introduce a decommissioning scheme. I am not opposed to such a scheme, but I want to know what its cost will be and how it would work. Presumably the hon. Gentleman worked out the figures and can give me the answer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the standard smart Alick question we have come to expect from a Government who have squandered more money on demented projects than any other. Is the hon. Gentleman not concerned that we are paying 75 per cent? Other figures have been quoted, but the precise sums that are contributed depend entirely on the decommissioning scheme. That is understood by the fishing industry, which does not expect to be told that £20 million, £50 million, or any other sum will be spent on a decommissioning scheme. It rightly wants to get to first base.<br><br>
The industry is, perhaps, a more natural spiritual ally of the Government than of my party, but it finds the conduct of the Minister and his colleagues deplorable. They have not been prepared to go to first base and to take the opportunity of sitting at a table with representatives of the fishing industry, to try to work out a scheme that is compatible with the Government's economic priorities and the industry's interests. There is no problem in giving a commitment to get to first base. The Minister fails to understand that that commitment is valued. There is no demand at present to put x million of pounds into a scheme. However, a reasonable, sensible approach is demanded. The debate should not be dominated and distorted by the paranoia of the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, simply because he was caught with his pants down in the Humber a decade ago.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that a Labour Government would introduce a decommissioning scheme, but that he does not know what form it would take, or how much it would cost. He made it apparent that he does not understand that, because of the Fontainebleau arrangements, two thirds of the cost of any decommissioning scheme would be met by the British taxpayer. Is the hon. Gentleman committing himself to a decommissioning scheme without knowing its cost, or to a scheme that involves no cost to the taxpayer? Two thirds of the cost would fall on the taxpayer. We are entitled to know how his party's scheme would work and its cost.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister asks which option I support. It is possible that I support neither. A decommissioning scheme is not an absolute. It depends entirely on the terms—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman committed himself to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not committed myself to anything new today. My hon. Friends have discussed the matter repeatedly at the Dispatch Box in various fishing debates this year. There is nothing new about our commitment.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0239">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How much will it cost?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister asks how much it will cost. Does he not know about a range of measures that could be implemented? The Minister said that decommissioning is my policy. How very interesting. When he attended earlier fisheries debates, did he not have a range of options to hand about how to introduce a decommissioning scheme? If he did not, my point is reinforced—he should discuss the options with the Scottish Fishermen's Federation. Perhaps he should send Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, who would know what the SFF was talking about. Such a meeting would discuss the options and the level at which a decommissioning scheme could be introduced. That would open up the process, and perhaps one could subsequently build on those discussions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This may be an appropriate moment at which to ask the Minister: how much would the Scottish Office's proposal for decommissioning in December 1989 have cost?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be appropriate, but I doubt whether the Minister will answer, because he does not know. He has been handed a piece of paper by the Government that says, "We are against the decommissioning scheme. Give them the one about, `If the industry wants to pay for it they can have it.' That will get us through another day." [<i>Interruption.</i>] I am contemptuous of the Minister's snipes. Everyone knows the parameters of a decommissioning scheme and the level at which one discusses it. The type of scheme will be dictated by the financial priorities of the incoming Labour Government and by the legitimate needs of the fishing industry.<br><br>
We should remember that it costs to do nothing. One could argue—on sound financial grounds—that it costs the taxpayer more to do nothing about decommissioning than to introduce a scheme. However, I do not want to get bogged down in that debate, and thus I prevent other hon. Members from contributing.<br><br>
I have a word of caution about the white fish sector of the processing industry, which is going through what the herring processing industry went through 10 or 15 years ago—a temporary crisis in stocks. Nothing was done to protect the industry during the earlier crisis. The herring fleet started fishing mackerel but there was no industry to process that fish. The Klondike-type industry in Shetland and Ullapool developed because there was no indigenous processing industry. It is crazy and short-sighted not to defend the white fish processing industry until stocks revive—as they will. If, because of the closures generated by the present situation, there is no processing industry when stocks revive, that will be an indictment of the Government's lack of action.<br><br>
I resent it when debates concentrate too much on one part of the country and on one part of the fishing industry. We should not forget that the Scottish fishing industry is made up of many smaller industries—there is one on the Clyde, one on the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
west coast, and another in the Western Isles. All are important to the communities that they serve.<br><br>
Can the Minister comment on regional management? Local priorities should determine to some extent how the fisheries in those areas are managed, so that companies from the powerful capital-intensive areas cannot move in and dominate the industry when that suits their purpose.<br><br>
I have two specific questions of particular relevance to the west coast, and which relate to my points about fish-farming. I referred to the depressed price of prawns, which affects hundreds of people. Hundreds of jobs on the west coast are dependent on prawn fishing. That industry has been severely hit in recent months by the sharp drop in prices. At present, it is non-quota stock. I know that the Minister's civil servants have heard the arguments at first hand, and I regret that there has been no reaction, but strong views are held on the west coast. It is felt that a management system for prawn fishing should be introduced, there should be a control on effort, quotas should be introduced, and local industries should be protected from all-comers who find it temporarily convenient to move into new areas.<br><br>
The device that is favoured on the west coast is the creation of a five-day fishery. Weekend closure would be a conservation measure that the Government should support.<br><br>
My second specific point—and it has been drawn to my attention by the west coast—is the fact that the price of lobsters is now at rock bottom. If that persists, many small boat keel fishermen will suffer severely. I understand that the cause is a size control imposed by the United States on small lobsters from Canada. That caused the Canadians to divert their exports from the US market on to the European market—and particularly the British market.<br><br>
Why is it always other countries that—and this is at the heart of the matter—can impose such restrictions to protect their own industries, and that the product in question is then dumped in this country? Will the Minister or one of his colleagues take the same kind of action to protect lobster fishermen in Scotland, by banning the importation of small lobsters? That would also be a conservation measure. I do not expect the Minister to give a detailed reply, but I should be grateful if he wrote to me.<br><br>
I shall truncate my remarks on fish-farming. It is an equally urgent issue and one about which I feel deeply. I am familiar with the communities in which fish-farming is now virtually the only form of waged employment. If the rug is taken out from under the feet of fish farmers, the repercussions for those communities will be catastrophic. While fish-farming has become the dominant waged industry in those areas, other industries have fallen by the wayside. If fish-farming is taken away, there will be nothing left.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dumfries, several other hon. Members, and myself, were present at a briefing given by the Scottish Salmon Growers Association. One statement made at that briefing was more chilling than the rest. It was that even the "big boys" cannot continue to sustain such losses for much longer. That
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0240">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
has an historical basis and, as I said, there is no point in going over old ground.<br><br>
The way that the industry developed means that the decision on its life or death now rests in perhaps three or four boardrooms far removed from the scene of the action. If Booker McConnell, Unilever, or one or two others decide to pull out, more than 90 per cent of the industry and its jobs will be affected. The decisions are concentrated in so few hands. The salmon-farming industry lost £20 million last year. It will not be able to lose £20 million for more than another year or two without going down, and everything that has been built up in those communities over the past 15 years will disappear with it. The Government must act.<br><br>
It is not a case of not making a convincing argument. The argument was put and won. The European Commission accepted unanimously that Norway was dumping. Then, astonishingly, there was a 10:2 vote against doing anything. What is the point of that procedure if, in the end, the British Government, armed with a European Commission finding, can attract only Ireland as an ally against the other 10 states in the European Community? The net result is that nothing happened, and Norway continues to dump as it likes.<br><br>
The issue must be given a higher priority. I do not care if the Department of Trade and Industry, the Scottish Office, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, or whoever, does it, but priority must be given to protecting fish-farming or it will disappear. Make no mistake—it is that urgent.<br><br>
The point made about the Crown estate commissioners was a good one. They are not the major contributors to the present crisis, but it is galling if, when an industry loses £20 million a year, more than £1 million must be gratuitously handed over to a landlord for absolutely and precisely nothing. That is adding insult to injury.<br><br>
I read in the <i>Financial Times</i> today that because of the devaluation of property over the past year, the value of the Crown estate diminished by 12.5 per cent to £2.08 billion. Fish-farm rents, at around £1 million, represent less than 1 per cent of the commissioners' annual revenue. In other words, fish-farming is worth nothing to them, but the Crown estates are financially important to the fish-farming industry.<br><br>
I ask the Minister to put pressure on the Crown estate commissioners, not to withdraw completely—that is another argument—but, when their rent reviews take place later this year, to declare that they will return to charging peppercorn rents, so that that burden at least will be removed from the salmon-farming industry in Scotland.<br><br>
I stress the urgency. There must be action or salmon-farming will collapse. Some £25 million of public money will be thrown away and the Government will have been entirely responsible through washing their hands and their lack of action.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several Hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I intend to call the Liberal Democrat spokesman to wind up at 12.40 pm and, with his co-operation, the Minister at 12.50 pm.</span></p>
<p>12.5 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The horse has bolted. It is past 12 o'clock. There are now restrictions on the poor old Back Benchers, who have 40 minutes in which to speak. I know that it is not your fault, Mr. Hogg, but for three Front-Bench spokesmen to take an hour and a half is a gross injustice for the Back Benchers who are here because of their constituency interests.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I simply told the Committee of the agreement between the Liberal Democrat and Government Front-Bench spokesmen, to assist Back Benchers in co-operating with one another. I am conscious of the difficulties, but I was trying to be helpful. The Minister signalled to me that he will take only five minutes to wind up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was making the point that poor old Back Benchers have to carry the can for the very long speeches from members of the Front Benches, who should limit their contributions to 20 minutes. It is a pity that agriculture is not a part of the debate because there are so many difficulties with the common agricultural policy that we should like to discuss.<br><br>
Along with every other member of the Committee, I accept that fishing is going through a difficult time. What is needed above all else is an acknowledgement that those difficulties exist. Collectively, we must find a way forward. All my views are shared, but would be expressed much more eloquently, by my right hon. and close friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) who would normally be making a powerful speech from these Back Benches. We all hope that he is out and about soon.<br><br>
I appreciate that in many respects our hands are tied by the EC, but sometimes I suspect that we interpret the regulations far more inflexibly than is necessary. Perhaps do not go to the end of the road to try to obtain better terms for our fishermen. By fishermen, I mean processors, too. Like all hon. Members, I received a useful letter from the Scottish Fish Merchants Federation and a briefing on fishing generally from Grampian region. With regard to processing, I am glad that the Government have put so much European money into marketing in recent years and will continue to do so in future. I note that the letter of 13 June mentions expenditure of £15 million over the next three years. That should help the processing industry—which like the catching sector, is experiencing great difficulties.<br><br>
The catching sector is restrictive, and I accept that that is an essential part of all conservation policy. I do not profess to be an expert, so I shall certainly not discuss mesh sizes and whether they are 90 mm or 120 mm, or whether they are diamond or square. I leave that to those who are much more involved than I am. But in terms of our inflexibility, I got rather cross at our debate on 5 March in which I spoke about the eight-day tie-up—as did my right hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside.<br><br>

Although we have a limited, but important, amount of fishing in the Solway, I know more about the fishing towns of the Moray Firth—and I realise just how important the industry is to the people in Lossiemouth, Burghead, and elsewhere. I felt that whatever the rules and regulations of the EC on the eight-day tie-up, which have been enshrined in legislation, some flexibility was needed on the non-fishing time—the time spent steaming from one port back to the home port, or to the boatyard for repairs. I felt that there must surely be a way around the problem—even if it meant someone going on board to put a seal on the gear so that it could not be used until it got into the harbour again, where the seal could be broken. I was unhappy about that debate, and I did not support the order when it came to a Division.<br><br>
I thank all the Ministers, and particularly my noble Friend Lord Strathclyde, who is making staunch efforts both in Europe with the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and directly, by touring round the fishing areas of Scotland to meet fishermen and the representatives of highly important organisations such as Bob Allen and his Scottish Fishermen's Federation. There is strong feeling, and we must try to strike a new balance between conservation—which is essential—and the catch. We must also find a way of balancing the two with the EC regulations.<br><br>
After all, ours is by far the biggest fishing country in the EC. Our interests ought to be at the top of the tree, and other countries should be pecking away below, trying to accept the fishing policies that we advance. We have the greatest experience, and the industry is of great financial importance to us.<br><br>
If we follow the simple logic that conservation must have top priority or else there will be no stock in future, we must find a way of helping fishermen financially, yet reducing the pressure on them. That leads us back to decommissioning. I accept that such a scheme is frequently used in Europe, where a substantial amount of money is available from the EEC. Such money is needed to match the amount of money that would have to be put in by the Treasury.<br><br>
It is generally agreed by members of the Committee—with the exception of my hon. Friend the Minister, who cannot agree from his place on the Front Bench—that we must find a way forward. I cannot see that happening without getting round a table and talking the matter through.<br><br>
We need to know what amount the Government expect the industry to contribute and how much conservation is to be included in the equation. We must agree about what to put to the Treasury. Inviting the fishermen's federation to propose a scheme would lead to months of negotiation. I should like to inject more rapidity into the discussions, and that can be achieved only by getting round the table and discussing what the Government mean by "contribution", in financial and conservation terms.<br><br>
There is great dissatisfaction throughout the fishing industry, and we must all do our best to find solutions. That can be done only by compromise and by round-table talks.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
I was slightly worried at my hon. Friend's instant reaction, when I compared decommissioning with set-aside. I am no enthusiast of set-aside, because I believe that the principle is wrong. Good land is taken out of production and nothing is done with it; sadly, people are often put out of work. Decommissioning is, in principle, the same. We are taking something out of production, by denying the industry the opportunity to catch fish. That is surely the same as taking the production capacity of their land away from farmers to reduce food stocks. The EEC and the Treasury seem happy to fund set-aside schemes, yet they are reluctant to fund a reduction in fishing by production by removing a substantial number of fishing boats and controlling the type of gear that the remainder use.<br><br>
There should be harmony in the industry. We can obtain that only by discussing the issue and proposing constructive schemes that achieve conservation and which are acceptable to Europe, the Government and fishermen.<br><br>
Drift netting has no impact on Scottish fishermen. It is a problem for the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. However, the results of drift netting off the north-east English coast and elsewhere have a serious impact on Scotland so the Scottish Office must try to reach a solution on that issue, too. We in Scotland gave up drift netting years ago. Only two countries continue the practice—Eire and England. This year the Faroes gave up drift netting. That is a shining example to England. Surely the Government cannot continue to support drift net fishing off the north-east coast of England to the detriment of salmon and sea trout stocks in Scotland when the Faroes are prepared to give up the practice in the interests of conservation.<br><br>
I shall not go through all the arguments that were advanced in the Committee stage of the Salmon Act 1986. We highlighted how important salmon stocks are to tourism and to the rural areas of Scotland in that they bring many people to fish in our country. If we run down our salmon stocks any further, that great advantage will disappear.<br><br>
I remind my hon. Friend the Minister that the Committee of the Salmon Act 1986 proposed that a committee be set up to consider drift netting and to make recommendations—perhaps to phase it out. It is now 1991, yet I have not seen a report or heard of any action being taken.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Godman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that those north-east English drift net fishermen should receive compensation for giving up that method?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I spoke of phasing out. As people with drift netting interests come to retirement, or give up fishing, then, so be it—but new licences should not be issued. There is too little time now to discuss the possibility of compensation. But if we are to retain a salmon fishing industry in the east coast rivers of Scotland, we must do something pretty urgently about the catches now coming from the drift net fisheries of the north-east.<br><br>
I am a recipient in my constituency of the product of fish farms. We must ensure that there will be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0242">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
adequate stocks in the future. There are 300 people employed in salmon smoking in Arran, and many others in the Ross group handle scampi and prawns.<br><br>
We must look after the fish-farming industry right through to the end. That includes keeping a close watch on the Food Act 1990. It has nothing to do with Europe, which, incidentally, has caused enormous problems over the posting of smoked salmon during the past year. That problem has now been resolved, but it should have been anticipated and ought not to have arisen. We must deal with the dumping of salmon from Norway, as the hon. Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) said. We cannot have salmon which sells at £1.50. It will destroy the immensely important fish-farming industry—especially in the west and north of Scotland—which means so much to us. It would be a total waste of the money that the Government and industry have invested in the fishing industry if action is not taken. I have read the correspondence and listened to debates in the House, but it is action that is needed to deal with Norwegian dumping.<br><br>
I wish that people would act responsibly. There have been headlines about the damage done to fish by pesticides. It would be better if people kept quiet until they could prove their claims, rather than fly kites. They should wait until the results of laboratory tests are known before starting a row and destroying an industry with outspoken comments—such as those from Friends of the Earth—which may prove entirely wrong. People should act with greater responsibility given that so many jobs, as well as the interests of consumers, are at stake.<br><br>
I agree with the comments about Crown estates, planning, marine nature reserves, and the recommendations in the nature conservancy report on fishing farming and on safeguarding the natural marine environment. If time permitted, I could speak at length about those matters.<br><br>
Fish-farming is crucial to Scotland. We must have prime involvement in all the aspects that I have mentioned—the fishing industry generally, salmon farming, and the retention of salmon in Scottish rivers through taking action on drift netting. I urge the Government to bring about that involvement.</span></p>
<p>12.18 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Speeches by the Minister of State on the health service have been described as abusive, knowledgeable and wrong. When the Minister speaks about fishing, the knowledge drops out, and only the abuse and mistaken policy remain.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman's performance in the debate on the eight-day tie-up in March, and that of the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)—together with their attitude to genuine points made about safety by a range of hon. Members representing fishing communities—will not be lightly forgotten nor forgiven, around the coast of Scotland.<br><br>
I accept the Minister's invitation to defend the five-point plan that I put forward some weeks ago, but first I shall briefly address points made by the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
Scottish Salmon Growers Association and the problems that that industry faces.<br><br>
Members of Parliament who attended the SSGA's briefing felt that it was one of the best that had ever been given in the House. It was knowledgeable on fact, positive in approach, and provided much detail on the industry's importance to the Scottish economy. The industry's total output is worth about £140 million, and upwards of 6,000 jobs are dependent on it.<br><br>
The Minister said that the Scottish Office is fighting hard for the industry in Europe; but that is not the view of the SSGA, which said that when approached, Ministers offered only platitudes. The SSGA fears that the industry's interests are being sacrificed in the discussions between the European Community and the EFTA countries—the same fear that the Scottish Fishermen's Federation has over access to regional stocks.<br><br>
The Minister owes the Committee a firm assurance that the interests of the Scottish salmon industry are not being soft-pedalled for fear of upsetting the EFTA discussions. He should specify the exact role of the Scottish Office in those negotiations so far.<br><br>
I resent being told by the Minister of State—or any other Tory Minister—that I am not interested in conservation of fish stocks. In a similar debate two years ago, I listed seven specific conservation measures as a central part of my speech. The Scottish Office acted on none of them. The only so-called conservation initiative from the Scottish Office was the mistaken, misjudged, and futile eight-day tie-up provision.<br><br>
The kernel of the argument against tie-up centres on fishing safety. It is now summer, but when autumn's bad weather arrives, the fishing safety problems will increase, and the danger that continuous tie-up imposes on fishermen will be exacerbated. The problem will then return to the forefront of political thinking—hopefully in this House, but certainly in Scottish communities.<br><br>
The argument against tie-up does not relate solely to fishing safety, for the fact remains that it does not work. It does not restrict fishing effort, but simply concentrates fishing efforts into specific—and largely unsuitable—time periods. The Government's alibi is that tie-up was not really their fault, but was imposed by the European Commissioner and other bad people in the EC. That argument does not hold water—either with the fishing industry, or with Members of Parliament who represent fishing communities. We remember debating the issue before the Council negotiations in December that introduced tie-up. We especially remember the closing remarks of the Secretary of State for Scotland:
<br><blockquote><p>"That seems another sensible measure which is worth considering in the context of the need to conserve stocks."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 13 December 1990; Vol. 182, c.1223]</p></blockquote>
So it is not good enough for the Minister of State to tell us that the measure was imposed by the European Community when we know that the Secretary of State for Scotland went into the December negotiations arguing in favour of tie-up as a sensible measure.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman) will bear me out on account of his
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0243">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
discussions with Senor Marin. The argument coming from Europe is, how can the British Government complain about the eight-day tie-up when they supported it as a sensible measure in the Council negotiations?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Godman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was told in Brussels that British Ministers made the initial proposal on the period of time involved—[Hon. Members: "Ten days".]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a lot of sense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman started his speech by protesting his knowledge of the subject, he should have known that that assertion was incorrect. The hon. Gentleman should give credit where credit is due. It was thanks to the efforts of my noble Friend and other Ministers that the proposed tie-up period was reduced from 10 days to eight days. If the hon. Gentleman goes around the country saying that eight days is proving ineffective, he is simply passing ammunition to those who argue that the tie-up rule should cover a longer period, as it does in other EC countries.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister deny that the Secretary of State for Scotland decided before the Brussels negotiations that tie-up was a sensible proposal? How can we believe that a ministerial team entered those negotiations to argue against the proposal when a key member of that team, who should have had an interest in fisheries policy, described it as a sensible measure in the House before the negotiations took place? That was not root and branch opposition to the measure.<br><br>
The issue is not of EC imposition; it is the fact that the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, either because he did not understand the measure, or because he wanted to impose it on the fishing industry, went into the negotiations supporting the measure—as the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow stated.<br><br>
The second proposal in my five-point plan covers square-mesh panels. I was arguing for such panels when the Minister probably still thought that they were something that went behind football goal posts. Square mesh panels have gained tremendous support in the fishing community. No one who has seen the videos and detailed examination of the potential escape of young fish alive into the sea could gainsay the tremendous support panels have in the fishing community. The Government jettisoned that support. Scientific advice clearly demonstrated in the Sunbeam trials that the 1980 formulation was the best scientific basis for the Mex fishery in the North Sea. The Government compulsorily introduced the 1990 formulation, with no concessions for smaller boats, which were hardest hit. After the latest breakdown in the negotiations, it seems likely that there will be settlement on 100 mm diamond mesh with 90 mm square-mesh panels as an option. If so, no one will take up the option because to fish with such a formulation would be not to fish at all, and the concept of the square-mesh panel with its benefits for conservation will be lost. Members of Parliament
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
who represent the fishing community believe that the proposal for square-mesh panels, which has such enormous potential, has been hopelessly mishandled by the Government, and the Scottish fishing industry has been left high and dry yet again.<br><br>
The Minister belittled the question of whether there should be a Scottish Enterprise effort for increased European assistance for fishing communities. I discussed that suggestion three weeks ago with Grampian Enterprise, which did not think it was silly. It is aware of the European Commission's report to Parliament approximately two months ago, which referred to a vastly increased structural funding budget. It is also aware that at the Eurofish conference the Commission's officials discussed a substantial increase in structural funding oriented towards areas dependent on fishing. It is aware that the Commission has already undertaken economic consultancy studies, to try to define which Community areas are most dependent on the fishing industry.<br><br>
My worry, and that of all Opposition parties, is that if the Government continue their obdurate insistence on to opposing structural funding on the basis of losing an element of the Fontainebleau clawback, none of the increased funds will be available for the fishing industry—in the same way that the fishing community has been deprived of the £130 million of structural assistance that went to other Community countries over the past three years or more.<br><br>
It is astonishing that the Minister made no substantive reference to the submissions that he received during the past few weeks from fish merchants and boat builders, all of whom argue that their industries are in severe trouble. There is no positive reference to how increased European Community funding might assist those vital industries in Scotland.<br><br>
My anxieties about industrial fishing are not simply that the Government say that they have a long-standing opposition to it, but that over the past five years—in the very period when the stocks for human consumption have been reduced to almost residual levels—industrial fishing in the North sea has increased year by year. If that happens against a background of Government efforts against industrial fishing, I hate to think what the result would have been if those efforts had not been made. In fact, no substantial effort to clamp down on industrial fishing has been made.<br><br>
The Minister seems to think it a slight matter that in November 1989 the Scottish Office argued for a decommissioning scheme. He did not make the mistake that Lord Strathclyde made on BBC television, of actually denying that was so. It is an important point. The Scottish Office—the same civil servants who are currently involved in fisheries policy management—presumably produced a detailed submission to go before a Cabinet committee in November 1989, which left Lord Sanderson to take forward the submission. How, over the past 18 months, could the same civil servants and the same Scottish Office belittle the arguments for a scheme? None of us who supports decommissioning believes
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0244">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
that it is a panacea to the industry's problems but know that over-capacity is such that decommissioning could help to reduce that overcapacity and make matters a little easier for those who remain.<br><br>
Every commentator on the industry, and every organisation representing it, believes that decommissioning should be part of an overall package to stabilise the industry's fortunes. The odd man out—just as he was the only Scottish Member of Parliament to vote for the eight-day tie-up—is the Minister of State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that he was not, but he was the only Scottish Member of Parliament to vote for the eight-day tie-up. The record is clear.<br><br>
What has the Scottish Office done in the past 18 months to promulgate the concept of decommissioning? It is perhaps because the Minister has his own personal reasons for opposing decommissioning that that policy has been totally abandoned by the Scottish Office during that period?<br><br>
I hope that when the Minister sums up the debate he will make a more positive contribution in those five minutes than he did in the half an hour that he took to introduce the debate. Yet again, we have had another fisheries debate which makes the case for direct Scottish representation in the European Community. We know that the Scottish Office itself could not put forward its own policy during the past 18 months because it suffers from the London veto.<br><br>
I believe that the fishing communities of Scotland, the boat builders, the processors, and all who are involved in this vital industry know full well the advantages of having directly elected Scottish representatives arguing for their case in the European Community—as opposed to those who are not elected by the people of Scotland and who argue against the interests of those communities and the industry at every opportunity.</span></p>
<p>12.33 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Doran <span class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must curtail fairly considerably what I had intended to say to allow my colleagues to speak.<br><br>
I shall concentrate my remarks on the fish-processing sector. However, I must express my dismay at the tone of these debates. Every time that there is a fishing debate, exactly the same things happen. We see the Government with their backs to the wall—represented today by the Minister, who has even had to fend off attacks even from his own Back Benches. All those with an interest in the fishing industry, who are close to it, and know its problems, go away feeling extremely frustrated and exasperated.<br><br>
There is an opportunity for partnership and a way ahead. The industry is attempting to give a lead but my contacts with the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, fish processors, and others involved in the industry say that their frustration is as deep as ours. However, no one in the Scottish Office or the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
Ministry of Agriculture in London is prepared to listen. They have no understanding of the industry. That was obvious today, when the Minister spoke about a vibrant fishing industry in Scotland. There is no such thing. Every aspect of it is threatened, and it feels isolated because of the lack of Government suppport.<br><br>
That is difficult for the industry to comprehend, because it is clear from all available evidence that there is a way ahead and the opportunity for all-party co-operation. We could go to Brussels with a unified voice but for the intransigence of the Government—in particular, on the decommissioning aspects of the policy.<br><br>
The fish-processing industry, which is of closest interest to me, makes a vital contribution to the country's health. All scientific evidence shows that fish is a healthy food and one people should be encouraged to eat. But as my hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, South (Mr. Lambie) said, it is being priced out of the market, and is regarded as almost a luxury food. In most areas of the country, fishmongers are closing and fish is being relegated to one small counter in supermarkets—unless one is prepared to settle for Brazilian tinned tuna or sardines. That appears to be the place that the nation will have to obtain its future supplies of fish. Our own industry is in severe danger, and it is running down dramatically.<br><br>
Unhappily, 1,000 jobs were lost in the fish processing industry since the beginning of 1990, 20 firms closed, and more are threatened. The tragedy is that the companies which were encouraged to invest in meeting the new European hygiene regulations are those that face the gravest problems. They are the most highly geared, and are also the ones being pressurised by banks.<br><br>
The Government say that there are plenty of stocks around if we are prepared to go out on to the world market. I visited a fish processing works in my constituency recently where virtually 75 per cent of its throughput was foreign fish that had been imported to meet the crisis. It was held in cold store to meet the demands of its customers. At the same time, the firm was having to pay extravagantly high prices for its fish.<br><br>
The Government claim that there is no problem because despite the reduction in the volume of fish landed, the price had gone up—which has consequences at the supermarkets because the housewife will not buy the product—and that helps the fish catchers. However, it does not help fish merchants, who have not seen a corresponding increase in the price at which retailers buy their products.<br><br>
There is a crisis in the industry. The threat comes from three directions. First, we need to invest to meet the European food hygiene regulations. Secondly, there is the problem of supplies—the bulk of which are now being imported. There has been investment to meet the processing requirements of different types of fish, and the salmon industry is playing a vital part in providing those supplies. But, again, that fish is expensive fish compared to just a year ago. Thirdly, there is the Government's
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0245">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
contribution. In Aberdeen, there is a tremendous fear about the consequences of the possible privatisation of the harbour, and a tremendous investment has been made by the harbour board in the new fish market there, but it is uneconomic and would never survive in a privatised company. However, for the past year we have had to fight off the suggestion that the harbour and the fish market will be privatised.<br><br>
Those are all matters of considerable concern to the industry, at a time when it should be receiving Government support to compensate for the lower availability of fish, and to meet new hygiene regulations. But the industry is receiving no support whatsoever. It presented its case and sought the Government's support, but was rebuffed at every turn. The industry did not understand why, because no proper replies were given to its questions—and the Government refused to consider any change in their policy.<br><br>
I do not comprehend why we separate agricultural from fishing policy, nor why we have no food policy to deal with the nation's needs and their consequences. Recently, the Government published a paper about healthy food, which suggested that we might change our diets. However, they gave no advice about making that change. Fish is one of the healthiest foods that we produce, and can improve the health of everyone. But the Government simply sit back and allow fish to be priced out of the market. We cannot understand that. It causes immense frustration—and, what is worse, it costs jobs.</span></p>
<p>12.40 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Calum Macdonald <span class='memberconstituency'>(Western Isles)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Safety at sea is a matter of life and death. I appreciate that an extension of the notification scheme, which the Minister mentioned, is not his direct responsibility but that of his colleagues in the Ministry of Defence. However, safety is of importance to Scottish fishermen and to hon. Members who represent Scottish constituencies—including my hon. Friends the Members for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes), and for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman).<br><br>
The extension of the notification scheme, which went beyond the Clyde to embrace a wider area, was welcome. However, it still omits large parts of the west coast inshore waters, where much fishing takes place, and where there is a lot of submarine activity. An incident occurred recently outside Stornoway harbour. One could argue—and I expect that the Ministry of Defence will argue—that there is less danger outside the present notification scheme area because there is less submarine activity, and therefore less chance of collisions between submarines and fishing boats. However, a danger still exists. One could argue, from the opposite direction, that once notification is accepted in principle—which is the difficult part—it ought to be easy to extend it in practice to areas such as the north Minch, where submarine activity is less intense. I hope that the Minister will convey to his colleagues in the Ministry of Defence the urgency and seriousness with which Scottish members of Parliament view that matter.<br><br>
I welcome the Minister's hesitant moves towards embracing a decommissioning scheme, even though
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
his moves were hedged with conditions and caveats. I shall not discuss the conditions that he mentioned. However—to introduce a note of caution—it is important for any decommissioning scheme to be targeted properly at those parts of a fleet that are responsible for overcapacity.<br><br>
There is a real danger, because many smaller or older boats operate on narrow margins, that it will prove tempting for some boat owners to embrace a decommissioning scheme with some enthusiasm. No one could blame them, but although it might benefit them as individuals, it would be a disaster for the west coast communities. The west coast fleet has already sunk far enough over past decades. A decommissioning scheme would have to be precisely targeted, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, North said, on those elements of the fleet that are responsible for the overcapacity. A decommissioning scheme could provide a breathing space and a new lease of life for the communities on the west coast.<br><br>
Shellfish fisheries are important to the west coast and to Scotland, and they have not received enough attention in the debate. Can the Minister assure the Committee that the Government will defend the exclusive rights of prawn fisheries up to the 12-mile limit in the review of the common fisheries policy? That is a matter of great importance to the Scottish fishing industry.<br><br>
I have asked the Secretary of State numerous times to impose a weekend ban on prawn fisheries on the west coast. I know that the Minister will not be able to answer that point in this debate, but I would be grateful if he wrote to me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Godman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. Do you have the authority to extend the sitting of the Committee by 15 minutes? I believe that the Chairman of a Standing Committee has that power.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will consider the position at one o'clock.</span></p>
<p>12.46 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Munro) is not present because I thought that his contribution to the debate was a model of its kind. An irreverent suggestion was made earlier that the hon. Gentleman might make a ministerial come-back. If he were to make a come-back, and was to bring to his responsibilities for fishing the same sense of purpose and vision that he showed this morning, some of us would feel more comfortable than we do with the knowledge that the responsibility for fishing lies with the current Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dumfries was particularly sensible in his observations about the eight-day tie-up. We know that that is a blunt instrument, but nothing has a more adverse effect that the insensitive use of a blunt instrument. One only has to read the fishing press to realise that the application of the eight-day tie-up is riddled with anomalies. While I accept the undertaking that the Minister repeated
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0246">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 39</span>
this morning, it will not deal with the point that the hon. Member for Dumfries raised.<br><br>
I am pleased to see that the hon. Member for Dumfries has returned to his seat so that he may hear rather than read of the congratulations that I extend to him. I hope that they cause him no local political damage. His speech this moring was a valuable contribution to the debate.<br><br>
It was inevitable that the debate would concentrate on the possibility of a decommissioning scheme. It is not easy to depart from the conclusion that Government opposition to a decommissioning scheme is based on a desire to protect the present Minister from any embarrassment that he might feel about the previous scheme for which he was responsible. Perhaps that explains the offence and disillusionment that the Scottish Fishermen's Federation felt after their meeting with the Minister on 3 June 1991.<br><br>
I suspect—and there is plenty of evidence—that the present Minister is a zealot. A zealot is someone who defies logic and whose conclusions defy the evidence placed before him. It has been said that the industry must provide the bulk of the money, and that appeared to be repeated today by the Minister, who said that the industry should make the principal contribution. That defies logic and evidence. It is not a viable industry that is being invited to make a contribution, but an industry that is severely crippled. The idea that such an industry should be obliged to make the principal contribution defies logic, as does saying that the responsibility for producing such a scheme should fall on the industry. Why should that be the case? Is there anywhere in Europe where it has been the responsibility of the industry concerned to devise a scheme for decommissioning?<br><br>
In endeavouring to fulfil the Government's request, the industry is operating blindfold. It may be argued that this is a matter of self-determination which the industry should be willing to take on itself, but we must remember that this is the most regulated industry in the United Kingdom. The idea that, in an exercise of freedom, the industry should be responsible for producing a decommissioning scheme—without which, apparently, the Government are unwilling to move—defies all logic. The Minister said that it was essential that a decommissioning scheme should be part of an overall conservation package. I put it the other way round: we will not have effective conservation until we have an effective decommissioning scheme.<br><br>
I should like to raise a constituency matter which also has significance in relation to what can be described as the village-based fishing industry. I believe that the Government are responsible for providing the infrastructure within which the industry can face its challenges now and in the future. In my constituency, the harbour at Pittenweem about which the hon. Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) obviously cares so deeply, is the subject of redevelopment proposals. It requires redevelopment to ensure proper standards of safety and hygiene. So far, the Government's response to the proposals has been, to put it charitably,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 40</span>
lukewarm. The village-based fishing industry will have little hope of survival unless there is a genuine commitment from the Government to ensure that the infrastructure is in place to allow the continuance of such industries which frequently have a disproportionate effect on the local economy.<br><br>
Those in my constituency who have responsibility for the fishing industry, such as Mr. Billy Hughes of the Fishermen's Mutual Association, find it difficult to understand that Danish boats 150 ft long may fish 25 miles off the coast of Fife, while boats half that length must be tied up for eight days in Fife harbour.<br><br>
We all wish to hear the Minister's response to our contributions but first, I should like to say a word or two about the industry. There is a deep sense of frustration in the fishing industry. A senior skipper, well known in the industry, told me the other day that he believed that the present regulations had turned those in the industry into law breakers. There always have been and always will be those who operate at the margin, but the existing circumstances encourage people to break the law—not to make unreasonable profits, but merely to stay in business. People find themselves compelled to break the law, not out of greed, but out of the desire for survival. If any of them have been listening to the debate, they can have derived very little comfort from it, because the Government's message has essentially been the same. The Government say that it is business as usual, but for the fishing industry that means a decline in business as usual.<br><br>
The fishing industry has not always found it easy to speak with one voice because of the diversity of interests that it represents. However, the Government have achieved the near-miracle of bringing about greater unanimity in the industry than ever before. That achievement arises not from a recognition of the merits of the Government's case but from the overwhelming feeling of adversity in the industry. The industry is united in its frustration and in its condemnation of the Government. There can rarely have been a time in the history of the industry—which is, by its nature, cyclical—when morale has been so poor and the sense of frustration so great.<br><br>
There has been a great deal of speculation, outside the Committee and in it, that the manicured accents of Ayrshire may be replaced by the more middle-class vowels of Argyllshire. That will make very little difference to the fishermen of Scotland unless the policy changes. I suspect that it may take more than a shuffling of coronets in the upper House to bring about an effective change in policy. Until that change in policy is effected, the fishing industry in Scotland will continue to face the problems that it finds it so difficult to cope with at present. It may be driven further and further into circumstances from which it finds it impossible to recover.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You have kindly allowed me five minutes to respond to the debate, Mr. Hogg. I should be happy to write to hon. Members on points that I am not able to deal with now. The hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Campbell)
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0247">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 41</span>
described the industry as crippled. There is no doubt that it is going through a difficult period but those who forecast desolation in the industry in 1990 were proved wrong and fishermen's earnings have risen again this year.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) told me something that I did not know, namely, that I was the only Scottish Member of Parliament to vote for the eight-day tie-up rule. I take a certain amount of pride in that. We are looking not at short-term solutions but at the industry's future as a whole. It is important that in taking such decisions, we look at the industry's long-term viability. If the hon. Gentleman goes around the country saying that the eight-day tie-up rule is not working in reducing fishing effort he will be in conflict with the industry that argues to the contrary. If he is successful in persuading the fishing community of that, he will wish upon their heads those who argue that the tie-up days should be extended as was originally suggested.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) produced a decommissioning scheme out of a hat. He could not tell us what types of vessels would be targeted or what rates of grants would be offered. He could not tell us how grants would be split between geographical areas. He could not tell us what age of vessels would qualify or how much it would cost. He could not answer the question that his hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) put to him about how we would protect the fragile fishing vessels of the Western Isles from such a scheme.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) raised the point that the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs Michie) made in her Adjournment debate about Highlands and Islands Enterprise. He expressed concern that membership of the Scottish Salmon Growers Association was being used as a condition for grant. I promised the hon. Lady that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary would write to her about that. I am sorry that she has not had a reply but it is because my hon. Friend is investigating the matter. If what she claims is happening, it goes well beyond what would be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 42</span>
appropriate for HIE to do in carrying out its grant policy.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman) asked about the EC negotiations and for an assurance that the fishing industry's interests would be protected. Part of the negotiations include additional access to Norwegian waters for EC fishermen. We are very much aware of the concerns of the salmon fishing industry. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has communicated that to the Foreign Secretary. It is very much in our minds during the negotiations.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland highlighted, as he has done elsewhere, the Shetland proposals. We have never received those proposals but I understand that they are not acceptable to the Scottish Fishermen's Federation. It seems unduly harsh to criticise the Scottish Office for not having responded to things which can be read about in the press only and which are not acceptable to the representative body.<br><br>
I was asked about assistance for the processing industry. Assistance is being provided through the EC. Almost 10 million has been awarded to Scottish processors in the past 10 years which must be added to significant back-up grant from the Agriculture and Fisheries Department. In addition, considerable investment has been made in the Aberdeen processing area, as the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) highlighted, through the Scottish Development Agency and local government.<br><br>
The Government have shown a willingness to stand up for the interests of our industry across a wide range of issues. We have been prepared to take the difficult decisions when they are in the best interests of the industry and we shall continue to do so. I am confident that as our conservation measures take effect, we will see stock recovering and the industry continuing to prosper.</span></p>
