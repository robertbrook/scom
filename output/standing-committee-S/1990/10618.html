	<br><blockquote><p>That during further proceedings on the matter of Local Government Structure and Finance in Scotland the Committee do meet on Thursday 20 June at half-last Ten o'clock.—[	<i>Mr. Lang.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Lang)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the matter of Local Government Structure and Finance in Scotland</p></blockquote>
I welcome the opportunity offered by the debates today and on Thursday to review the local government in Scotland and to reflect on the current review exercise. I also welcome the opportunity to debunk some of the myths that have grown up over our years in office and to put the record straight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the past decade, we have promoted considerable changes in the way that local government does its business. We have introduced competitive tendering. We have encouraged local government to work with new organisations such as the local enterprise companies. We have made changes to local taxation. We have set up the urban partnerships.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As established organisations are rarely comfortable with change, and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities is, of course, dominated by the Labour party, the public response of local government to all these changes has been somewhat negative. If one believed the doom and gloom that is preached by Opposition Members, one would think that local government had never been in such a sorry state. It is alleged constantly that the Government have reduced financial support for Scottish local authorities with the result that there has been a deterioration in the quality of local services. In fact, as so often is the case, the truth is very different from such allegations. It may be difficult for some members of the Committee to face the facts, but I propose to outline some of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall start with financial support. Government grants to Scottish authorities—rate or revenue support grant and specific grants—have increased in real terms from £2,562 million in 1979–80 to £2,809 million in 1991–92. So far from Government support having been reduced in the Government's period of office, there has been an increase in real terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What of the alleged deterioration in local authority services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gavin Strang 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the right hon. Gentleman including in that the current year, in which a bottom-up increase in Government support
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2</span>
has been achieved by putting up value added tax? Is he seriously including that in the Government's increased contribution to local authority expenditure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The figures that I gave relate to the period from 1979–80 to 1991–92, so they include the current year. Far from there having been a cut, as Opposition Members repeatedly allege, there has been a substantial, real terms, increase in Government support of 9.6 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What of the alleged deterioration in local authority services as a result of the Government's actions? The facts are very different from the allegations. Let us look at the three services that account for the biggest shares of local authority current expenditure—education, social work and the police. Since 1979 the percentage of pupils staying on until fifth year has increased from 35 to 54 per cent. The percentage staying on until sixth year has increased from 14 to 25 per cent and the percentage entering higher education has increased from 16.8 to 24 per cent. Expenditure per pupil has increased in real terms by 49 per cent. The number of field social workers has also increased.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Secretary of State leaves the subject of education, I have a question for him. I visited Queensferry high school last night to present Duke of Edinburgh awards. Teachers in Lothian region are appalled by the effects of charge capping. How can he justify in Lothian something that he will not impose in Dumfries and Galloway, which includes his constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Lothian spent more money—over 12 per cent—over its grant-aided expenditure than any other region. I note the relative speed with which Lothian regional council has moved to meet my demand for a reduction in its plans. That shows that the region is able to meet revised expenditure figures without inflicting undue pain on local residents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alistair Darling 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State cannot get away with that ridiculous statement. If the council had not moved quickly, the cuts would have been far worse when implemented in the late summer or in the autumn. Lothian region is in difficulties because grant settlements have been shamelessly rigged. The cost of providing services per head in the borders is greater than in Edinburgh, the poll tax in Edinburgh is lower because it receives more grant. Why does Westminster council receive £1,000 per poll tax payer while Lothian receives £453 per head? The Government continue to conduct a political vendetta against Lothian. The losers are, among others, school pupils and pensioners who do not receive home help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We cannot have such long interventions. We shall never get through the many speeches that will be called today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Lothian's objection to the basis of calculation for grant distribution is between it and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. That
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0302">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>3</span>
organisation is involved in negotiating how such calculations are made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I gave examples of the quality of local government services from education and social work. The number of field social workers has increased from 2,985 to 4,700—an increase of 47 per cent. There has been a 26 per cent increase in all social work staff, including a 13 per cent increase in home care staff. The number of places in local authority day care centres for the elderly has increased by 152 per cent. Places in such centres for the mentally handicapped have increased by 59 per cent and those for the physically handicapped by 49 per cent. Places for the mentally handicapped in local authority residential homes have increased by 77 per cent. The number of people who receive assistance from home helps has increased from 58,000 to over 80,000—an increase of 39 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Expenditure on the police service has increased in real terms by more than 50 per cent. The authorised establishment of police officers has increased from 13,275 to 14,045. Actual police strength has increased from 12,831 to 13,841. There are over 1,000 more police officers in Scotland now than in 1979. Such statistics do not show a deterioration, or even a marginal improvement, in the quality of local services. Services have improved greatly since 1979. The figures firmly dispel any doubts above the Government's commitment to local services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Staff and other resources are being used more effectively. In those services that are subject to competition, an improved standard of service is achieved with the same, or fewer, staff. I doubt whether that would have happened without the spur of competition, which the Government had the courage and foresight to apply to the unwilling flanks of local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was always possible for local authorities to test the market to ensure that they provided the best services. Very few did so. The Government had to legislate to secure competition in some local authority services. The Local Government Act 1988 has been in force for three years. It shows that the discipline of competition works. Some authorities claim that competitive tendering leads to increased costs. That may be so in some cases, especially when initial, one-off costs are considered. However, the savings that result from competitive pressures outweigh the extra cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Competitive tendering means more than savings. Benefits accrue from setting clear specifications, the acquisition of new and improved management skills, the cultivation of a more business like and innovative approach, the removal of restrictive practices, the setting of targets for standards and productivity and the development of performance indicators. The whole process, whether authorities have won the work themselves or awarded contracts to private firms, has been the catalyst for increased efficiency, better value for money and the best possible service for the consumer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the background against which it has been possible and appropriate to consider change in the structure of local government. The Government have done a great deal to ensure that the needs and wishes of the consumer of local authority services are better identified and better met by authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Secretary of State is truly interested in the consumer of services, will he explain why spending in Lothian region has been below the Scottish average in each of the past seven years, and it has received less in grant than any other regional council over the past eight years, including the present one? How is Lothian region supposed to serve its public when it receives such a poor Government grant? The level of grant is far below what the Secretary of State accepts for his constituency. How is Lothian supposed to deliver services at below the Scottish average cost? Is not the Secretary of State's treatment of Lothina region grossly unfair, and has he not robbed it of money so as to keep his constituents' poll tax artificially low?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is nonsense, and the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) knows it. He knows that the Government use the client group approach and that the grant-aided expenditure figures are calculated and negotiated every year with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities to take account of the needs and problems of each of Scotland's regions and districts. The hon. Gentleman knows that Lothian region has by far the densest population of all the regions, and that the circumstances there are very different from those obtaining in areas such as Dumfries and Galloway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities are now providing services that are more cost-effective and more closely geared to what their electorates want. They are doing that because of Government policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also encouraged local authorities to look beyond the provision of services at their own hand. That is often derided as eroding the role of local government. In fact, our efforts have been directed not at taking powers to the centre but at pushing power down to consumers of services or at encouraging a pluralistic approach, with local authorities working alongside specialist bodies such as Scottish Enterprise, the local enterprise companies and Scottish Homes as well as the private and voluntary sectors and community groups. Local government cannot be all things to all men, nor should it be. However, it can be a catalyst and an enabler, with its own special role to play. Our policies have encouraged and sometimes forced local authorities to be more outward-looking, to forge new and creative relationships with a multiplicity of organisations and groups. That may not have been comfortable, but it was necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In sum, the past decade has been one of substantial change and real progress. I see no evidence that local authorities in Scotland are a shadow of their former selves—quite the reverse. Local government in Scotland is alive and well. It is expanding in terms of overall staffing levels, unlike my own Department, where staff numbers have been reduced by 22 per cent since 1979. In addition, its expenditure has increased substantially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those changes in the role of local government, and the importance of maintaining accountability, have led us to conclude that the time has come to prepare for a move to a single-tier structure. The argument about
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0303">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
single-tier versus two-tier structures is not new. It was considered by Lord Wheatley. The Stodart committee clearly wished to consider the matter but its remit did not allow it. Even so, that committee felt it necessary to put up a clear marker that a single-tier approach would command widespread support in local government circles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Stodart committee was absolutely right, and that the response to the consultation paper which I published yesterday will demonstrate widespread support for a single-tier system of local government in Scotland. I hasten to add, in view of one of today's newspaper headlines, that such a system will not involve the wholesale abolition of the regions or of the districts. We intend to establish a system that meets the specific needs of all parts of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Maclennan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caithness and Sutherland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State clarify his attitude to the highlands, as there has been wide speculation that it differs from his approach to the rest of Scotland? He said in the House yesterday that the problem of remoteness was part of the reason for the Government's thinking on a single-tier structure, but that he did not think that remoteness was a reason why the highlands would be unsuitable for such a structure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be wrong for me to recommend any solution in any part of the country. For that reason, I would not like to foreclose on any of the options that will be considered during the consultation process, but I encourage the hon. Gentleman, his region and district councils and other bodies with an interest in the future local government of the highlands to submit their views on consultation. They will be taken fully into account and the needs of the highlands will be considered in their own right and not as part of some blueprint to be imposed across the highlands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the consultation paper will have reasured at least some Members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State give way to the overspill Bench?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give way to my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am not that. Better the sinner that repents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to ask the Secretary of State the question to which I did not get an answer yesterday. In the last reorganisation of local government in Scotland, the number of local councillors was reduced by 50 per cent and the bureaucracy was almost doubled. Do the Government intend further to reduce the number of local councillors in Scotland through this reorganisation? If so, will the Secretary of State concede that local government thereby becomes less social?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not concede the hon. Gentleman's conclusion, but we have emphasised in the consultation paper the need to minimise the cost and disruption of change in local government—something that did not happen in the previous change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
The consultation process will establish whether there will be more or fewer councillors. I expect that we shall end up with fewer councillors, but that would not diminish local government's capacity to deliver good local service. We propose to eliminate the two-tier system whereby there are two councillors for every part of the country, but that is a matter for more detailed examination in the consulation period and in subsequent consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am clear about the need for change. The changes which have taken place in local government since 1975, the shift in emphasis from direct service provider to enabler, the friction, duplication and waste that result from the two-tier system, the confusion in the public's mind are powerful arguments for a move to single-tier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also clear, however that the cases for change and for a single-tier structure need to be properly set out and considered. The principles that should underlie the new system also need to be set out and debated. That is what the consultation paper deals with and I assure the Committee that the consultation process will be thorough and not just a hollow exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The paper seeks views on several important issues such as what factors should determine the size of the new units; whatever there is an optimum, minimum or maximum size, and how we develop and sustain effective community links.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Instead of dealing with the real issues as the consultation paper does, it is significant that Opposition parties have tried to distract attention from the central thrust of our proposals, with which they seem to agree, by arguing for a commission, as there is to be in England, or arguing that reform is not necessary if we are not to have a Scottish assembly or Parliament. The truth is that the argument for a commission is a diversion to create some bogus controversy. I have made it clear that we shall set up whatever advisory body may be appropriate. An assembly would do nothing to make local government more local, powerful or effective—the reverse is true. To argue that the present structure of local government can be reformed only if a new layer of central Government is set up in Edinburgh is to insult those involved in local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monklands, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not one of the arguments for an independent commission that the Government's thinking is vague? The Secretary of State said yesterday:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I cannot think of any service at present delivered by local authorities that could be better delivered on a national basis."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 17 June 1991; Vol. 193, c. 36.]</p></blockquote>
Is that his view this morning? If it is, has the right hon. Gentleman changed his mind on the colleges of further education, which we discussed last week?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is sad that the hon. Gentleman so totally misunderstands our proposals for the colleges of education. We do not intend to centralise the delivery of further education. We intend to set up college councils—some have already been set up—and to devolve to them the powers to run their own colleges. The funding will come from the centre and that will be a considerable advantage to the colleges. I have no

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
doubt that the colleges will use such funding to obtain further funding from the private sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State's reply makes the Government's position even more vague. Will he confirm that the colleges of further education will be responsible not to the new local authorities for funding, but directly to the Secretary of State?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the position. I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman is not aware of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of my comments yesterday, I have been accused on the one hand of being doctrinaire and dogmatic and, on the other, of being vague and vacuous. Therefore, I suspect that I got it right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Eadie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Midlothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given all that the Secretary of State has said about the great progress that has been made under his administration and the proposal to have one-tier authorities, would not an independent commission bear out his belief that the consultation that he has proposed will be welcomed in Scotland? Therefore, why is the Secretary of State so unconfident about the proposals that he refuses to appoint an independent commission to examine them and to report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish I knew what the hon. Gentleman thinks an independent commission would do. What he seems to be contemplating is some kind of court sitting high above us mere mortals and passing judgment on us. In England, an advisory commission will look at the needs of the whole country on a rolling basis from area to area. The commission will develop proposals for the much more complex and larger-scale operation in England. That is not necessary in Scotland because we already have a more coherent and cohesive system of local government. Much of the background information and the possible building blocks for a new system are already available. Much of the preliminary work to being together the disparate and confused parts of local government has been done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Sillars 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not yet, because I am still responding to the hon. Member for Midlothian (Mr. Eadie).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of the rationalisation has already been done by the Wheatley commission. Against that background, there is no need to set up an advisory commission for the sake of it. If, later on, we need independent advice on the specific and detailed proposals, we are willing to consider—as I have said a number of times—establishing a body to give that advice. However, we should not set up a commission at the outset, just for the sake of having one. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales takes the same view about reform of Welsh local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sillars</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State said that he does not understand why some of us are arguing for a commission. Once the genie is out of the bottle, there will be a battle royal, crossing party boundaries, at the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
political level between district councils and regional councils that will cross party boundaries. That debate is perfectly legitimate. However, technical services such as water, transport, sewerage and drainage and strategic services such as education are above that political battle. The public, legislators and opinion formers could do with some objective advice from people with no district, regional or political axe to grind. That is the merit of such a commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is moving on to what will be the second stage of consultation. He rightly identifies issues that will need to be considered carefully, and we intend that they should be, but I cannot envisage one supreme body that would be omniscient on the entire range of issues. On certain specific issues, we may need to seek independent, impartial advice. However, I hope that those of us with Scotland's interests at heart will be able to rise above the party political battle to which the hon. Gentleman seems wedded and put the interests of Scotland first, as the Government firmly intend to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must press on with the taxation aspect of our proposals for the council tax. Effective local government requires a system of local taxation that will be stable, easy to administer and will be seen to be fair. I believe that the council tax will meet those objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under our proposals, each household will receive a single bill that takes account of the value of the property and the number of people resident there. There will be discounts of 25 per cent for single households and 50 per cent for empty second homes. There will also be discounts for students, student nurses and apprentices, while those on income support will be exempt. There will, of course, be a rebate scheme. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] In deference to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), I will compress my remarks on the council tax; plainly he realises that it is a winner and wishes to hear no more about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These arrangements will help to make the tax more acceptable and easier to administer and collect. We also intend to avoid those aspects of domestic rates that made them so unacceptable. Banding will prevent large tax burdens falling on a few people. Local authorities will have to take account of the burden on all their taxpayers when setting tax levels. By ensuring that local authority spending above or below a standard level will be reflected in its council tax bills, local taxpayers will have a clear message as to how their local authority's spending decisions influence what they are asked to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final part of our package is a strengthening of our approach to capping. One problem that we faced under the community charge was the abject failure of most local authorities to hold themselves accountable to their local residents. Last year, most authorities' spending went up by no more than the rate of inflation, but that was the year of the regional elections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This year, despite a generous RSG settlement of more that 10 per cent—even the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities acknowledged that it was generous—community charges were increased by an average of 30 per cent, regardless of whether an authority was

having problems with collection, a reason that has been used as a scapegoat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State mentions the increase in expenditure on one hand and the increase in the poll tax on the other. What was the increase in expenditure, rather than in the poll tax, this year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that the hon. Gentleman asked the question because he knows the answer. His reference to the link between expenditure and community charge is a revelation, because he seemed to think that the two are unrelated. The community charge has had to increase because of the high spending plans of local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The unacceptable part of local authorities' behaviour is their total disregard for the community charge burdens that they have imposed on their local residents as a result of spending programmes that they have made no effort to adjust in the light of the resources available to them. The supreme example of that was the figure of £584, which the combined efforts of Lothian regional and Edinburgh district council were to impose on the citizens Of Edinburgh. That was the height of irresponsibility and it prompted us to intervene to protect local residents from their own authorities. There was no need for charges to have risen by as much 30 per cent. It would have been possible for local authorities to have adjusted their spending without significantly affecting the delivery of services and to avoid putting up charges by that amount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should not have been surprising that one of the first conclusions that we reached as a result of our review of local government finance was that the burden on local domestic taxpayers was too high. We acted immediately to deal with that by reducing by £140 the charges set by local authorities this year
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That general increase in spending and lack of self control by local authorities was one reason why I decided to strengthen the capping powers available to me, as Secretary of State, and why my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment intends to widen the scope of his capping powers. I give way to my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish that when the Secretary of State refers to "my hon. Friend", he will distinguish between his hon. Friends sitting at the top end of the Government Benches and my hon. Friends sitting at the far end of those Benches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Secretary of State has again mentioned Lothian, will he explain why he has taken it upon himself to decide that it is unreasonable for the elected local authority of Lothian to provide free transport for pensioners within the region? The authority was elected to do that. The Secretary of State has not been elected by the people of Scotland, let alone those of Lothian, and should explain why he has imposed that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
restriction. By what democratic right does the Secretary of State act?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My democratic right is that given me by statute passed by this House. That is a sound basis for action. How Lothian spends its money is a matter for the council. The hon. Gentleman should ask the council about its decisions on charges to its spending programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government moved quickly to introduce the Local Government Finance and Valuation Bill, which the House considered last week. I hope that it will not be necessary to use those capping powers extensively, but Scottish local authorities substantially increased the burden on their taxpayers in real terms this year. There is no reason why the protection for Scottish local taxpayers should be any less than that for their English and Welsh counterparts. Consultation on the council tax has been completed. We shall carefully study the many responses that we have received and bring forward proposals for introducing the tax after considering those responses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, where do the Opposition stand? What would they do about capping? They would abolish it. What would they put in its place? The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We would certainly do all we can to encourage councils to behave sensibly."</p></blockquote>
There is the smack of firm government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What would the Opposition do about the council tax? That is more difficult. The right hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley) said that they would repeal it, but the hon. Member for Dagenham said that they would only change it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am having difficulty hearing the Secretary of State because the hon. Gentlemen in the back stalls keep talking to them in the Gallery.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a great pity, Mr. Hogg, because I am sure that you wish to hear about the Labour party's confusion on these matters. The Labour party is all over the place and does not know what to say or do. In the past three years, the Labour party has given us no fewer than 65 different policy position on local government finance. The Opposition's final position is the worst of all possible worlds. They would take us back to the rates—the revaluation lottery, high bills, spendthrift uncapped councils and uncontrolled business rates at the mercy of each local authority. At the next election, the country will have a clear choice between our council tax or going back to the rates under Labour. I have no doubt which people will choose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been working our way, in consultation with others, towards a fair and durable solution. The Labour party has stood on the sidelines, sniping and continuing the unconstructive, factional approach to policy making that has become its hallmark in recent years. It was unwilling to participate in discussions of our proposals while we were formulating them because it refused to talk without setting preconditions. Its policy position has been subject to confusion, uncertainty, drift and change throughout the past three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0306">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
Not only does the Labour party want to return to domestic rates, which its leader described as being the most unjust of all taxes, but it claims that it will do so within less than nine months, although no local government professional believes that that timetable is possible, pending the introduction of a supposedly different, but fairer, rate alternative. Labour then wants to move on to the delights of the roof tax, which has been rejected by four-fifths of its supporters and was quickly hidden from sight because it was so unattractive. That is all to be achieved while abandoning any capping of local authority expenditure and harmonisation of business rates and with a system that uses four different valuation factors and annual rolling revaluations. Labour would let local government spending rip and abolish our controls on business rates. That is a recipe for economic disaster and local government mayhem. The Government's actions speak for themselves. Local government is far from being in a state of collapse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I am sorry, I shall finish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local government is being revitalised and given new direction. The Government will ensure that the review results in a local government system that is properly resourced, strong, flexible and cost-effective, commands local loyalties and meets Scotland's needs now and in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. The Committee is entitled to know whether the last five minutes of that speech was written by a civil servant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nothing in our standing orders permits me to ask any member of the Committee who wrote his or her speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.5 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar (Glasgow, Carscadden)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was unaware that my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) thought so badly of the civil service. Clearly the latter part of the Secretary of State's speech was a case of "in his own writ" and that is what is so depressing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State may imagine that local government is alive and well, but that raises the interesting question of whom he speaks to. It may undermine the rumour that the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) is no longer in favour in the Scottish Office, as I can only imagine that it is from such a source that such eminent nonsense comes. The Secretary of State must know that there is a major crisis of morale in local government. I am talking about not only elected councillors, but officials and anyone involved in local government. No doubt we shall refer to that many times in this debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to get away from the arid gabble of statistics with which the Secretary of State began. Later, I shall refer to the paper on structure published yesterday, which on a first reading it seemed a remarkably shallow
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
and uninformative document. I shall begin with finance. Almost everyone in Scotland would agree that nowhere have the Government done more damage than with the poll tax. No single episode in my political memory has been so irresponsible. Such stupidity arises when panic creates a political void and gives an opportunity for extremists and zealots. We have had two years of bitter experience and it has taken all of that time to convince the Government that they must retreat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The price of their pride has been high. One casualty is the credibility of the local government finance system. It will—I say this with no pleasure—be very difficult to establish any replacement in the public mind as fair and justifiable. It will be virtually impossible to sustain the poll tax through the remainder of its wretched and limited life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the new rating system that the Government propose. I use the term deliberately because it is disingenuous of the Secretary of State to pretend that what he advocates is not a rating system. It has special features; it has been dressed up to allow the maintenance of the pretence that it is not a rating system, but it is completely that in all its essentials. It has one or two features that we regard as unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed banding is unnaturally restricted. There are to be seven bands, but built into the system is a protection for those living in houses at the top end of the valuation scale. The Secretary of State has been unashamed about that; in politics it would be called gerrymandering—a fix. To be fair, there are signs of unease on the Conservative Benches. Under the auspices of the right hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Heseltine), there was the brief appearance of a nine-band exercise, which might have done something to redress the balance. It was instantly countermanded by the Prime Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It cannot be right that, under that system, a wealthy man living in a luxury apartment will pay only twice as much as a couple living in a difficult-to-let council flat. There is no doubt that the Secretary of State has been a fierce critic of capital valuations. I concede that until recently he was consistent on that point. He developed the theme that capital valuations were unfair on many people, but especially on those at the bottom of the scale—for example, the person who had bought his council house would find that local taxation liability would be based on its capital value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not mention it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State may not have done, but the right hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind) mentioned it consistently: I have the quotes. I shall give way if the Secretary of State wants to repudiate the right hon. and learned Gentleman's arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A capital valuation system would be an insult to people who had bought council houses. Added to that insult is the injury of weighting the system so that those at the bottom of the valuation range will pay more than they would otherwise have had to. Many Scottish
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0307">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
organsiations have made that point and I hope that the Secretary of State will listen to them, even at this late stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party believes that the range should be extended. Government figures for 1991–92 suggest that the average household bill under their system would be £420. It would, on average, be less under our system. I say that the average would be less because we assume that the same amount of money would be raised. In our system, the average would be lower as the distribution that we propose is different and fairer. We should not over-protect those who will benefit from the generosity of a Conservative Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 25 per cent discount should be re-examined. I do not quarrel with its aims: many people live in houses with inflated values that are out of line with their income. However, assistance should be targeted. There is no reason why a bachelor living in a semidetached house should benefit from a 25 per cent rebate when next door the pensioner couple living on a lower income pay considerably more. The rebate scheme should be used to ensure that distribution is fairer and that help is concentrated on those in need. It is difficult to discuss that issue as we do not know how the rebate scheme will be funded or what form it will take. We can, however, consider whether the proposed 25 per cent rebate could be targeted more accurately. Failure to do that will mean that the system will create as many problems as it solves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government conceded that the 20 per cent rule is wrong in principle and indefensible in practice. It causes misery, confusion and distress to the most vulnerable in the community. The Government have surrendered on the argument. The tax does not have a friend in the land and hsould be killed off now, not allowed to limp on until 1993. Every major organisation that commented on the matter called for instant abolition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Audit Commission has blow out of the water the Government's case for retaining this nonsense until 1993. It was argued that abolition would cost over £30 million. That would have been a good buy. According to the Audit Commission's investigations, the average cost of collecting from those on income support in England is two and a half times the net yield to the Exchequer. Does the Secretary of State believe that the arithmetic for Scotland would be any different? It is financial madness and social vandalism to allow this form of taxation to continue until 1993.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A consequential reduction in income support rate when the poll tax and the 20 per cent rule go would be monstrous. In paragraph 3.8 of the consultation paper, the Government claim that they will need to consider just such a reduction at the relevant time. In effect, that would cut £2.61 a week from the meagre amount allowed to a married couple on income support. It would reduce their subsistence payment to about 18 per cent of average male gross earnings. As a result their income would be lower as a percentage of those earnings than when the poll tax first made its sorry appearance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those on income support have had a particularly rough passage with the poll tax. They already face the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
disappointment of discovering that the £140 reduction this year has been sold on a false prospectus and is worth only £28 to them. It would be wrong if they had to make a further sacrifice on the death of the tax. No Government with heart or a sense of social responsibility would contemplate that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister replies to the debate on Thursday, will he say something about water and sewage charges? I understand that those charges will not be within the rebate system and will still have to be met, even by those who have 100 per cent rebate for the new tax. Present charges suggest that those at the bottom of the income scale will have to meet a substantial remaining bill. It is important that the Minister clears up that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that I can support much of what the Government are doing. I do not want to be ungracious. Indeed, I support some proposals with more enthusiasm that the hon. Members for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) or for Stirling. I doubt whether the hon. Member for Stirling can contemplate the wreck of his hopes. Those two hon. Members are the equivalents of the cabin boys, loyal to the last, going down with the Thatcherite flagship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, I welcome the property-based system and that the liability is on the householder alone. Who would have imagined that only a few months ago those principles would have had such unlikely advocates? What I do not like is the dishonesty and pretence that is still built in to the scheme. The hon. Member for Eastwood suggested that there was no need to value properties individually. I hope that he has read the assessors' comments on that. They say that they would have no basis to argue their case at appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also object to the fact that the Secretary of State—he was at it again today—suggests that under his system there will be no need for revaluations. He should ask the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in Scotland about that. In Paragraph 6.1 of the institution's comments says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"some provision for revaluation would, it is submitted, be essential."</p></blockquote>
I see that the hon. Member for Stirling is leaving. Some disappointments must be bravely borne.
	<br><blockquote><p>"some provision for revaluation would, it is submitted, be essential. A tax based on out of date property values would rapidly become discredited in the eyes of the public."</p></blockquote>
That point has been made in one form or another by almost every relevant organisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman considered that the average length of a mortgage is between six and seven years? that means that a house is automatically priced when it goes on the market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have considered many aspects. I am simply making the point that the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in Scotland, the Law Society, the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives and the Scottish Assessors Association all believe that if the system is to have any credibility, some form of revaluation must be built into it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0308">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
I do not know whether the Secretary of State goes along with his hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government and Inner Cities who said that once a property was in a band it would be there in perpetuity. If that is true, there would be no need for revaluation, but there would be no difficulty in using, for example, the 1985 valuation roll for the banding process. If a house stays in the same band, irrespective of the value of properties in the area and no matter how many hundreds of years pass, the huff, puff and commotion about the wickedness of the 1985 revaluation can hardly be justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one assumes that properties do not shift bands and that there is therefore no need for revaluation, why was there all that panic in 1985 and why is the main charge against the old system the fact that it involved these damaging revaluations? If there is some risk in the principle of revaluation, one can only assume that without revaluation, the banding would lose credibility and the system could not survive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure why the hon. Gentleman is getting so hung up on revaluation. There has to be some capacity for a limited measure of revaluation, but what matters is the relative position of a house to other property values in the same and adjacent bands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested to hear that there is to be a limited measure of revaluation. We look forward to hearing that further defined. Commenting on the suggestion that revaluation should take place only when a house is sold, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors pointed out that in the case of three properties in a row, if one is sold three times in 10 years and is revalued each time so that it moves up several bands because of inflation, the others would remain where they were. An enormous gap would open up in the liability of the occupiers of those neighbouring properties. Is that a serious suggestion? Do the Government really put that forward as worthy of discussion? If so, they should listen to the professionals, the people who know how these systems work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is on to a crucial point. In 1985 when revaluation took place the then Secretary of State gave instructions that the burden had to be transferred from the industrial properties to the domestic and commercial properties. The rate support grant was reduced by 12 per cent. No system could have withstood the combination of all three factors. The key factor in the present Secretary of State's proposals will be the balance between the property tax and the personal tax. The Secretary of State has singularly failed to say anything about the balance that will be struck between those taxes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made a relevant point. There was a shift between the non-domestic and the domestic rates, although I do not know whether it was under instructions from the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take it from the vehemence with which the Secretary of State makes that point that he thinks
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
that there would have been something wrong in an instruction from the Secretary of State to alter that balance. We understand that he is taking powers to be able to issue such instructions about the balance between the personal and property element to which my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Ewing) referred. That raises interesting questions about probity and political morality in these difficult areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State would be well advised to look at our proposal for an emergency package. He should consider using the 1985 valuation roll as an initial bridging operation from which the parties could continue the argument and professionals could continue the work for the introduction of a new weighting system based upon property values. We must avoid the present situation in which the Government are running scared, desperately ahead of the poll tax disaster. They are coming up with one idea after another—mostly bad ones—to get themselves out of trouble.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 20 per cent rule should be ended now. Benefits ought to be backdated. I do not suggest an amnesty, but a return of entitlement which Parliament always intended. That is an important point although I cannot go into it in detail. Over the two years it is quite possible that a person who ought to have paid £300 and who is perhaps now prepared to pay that sum, sadly late, will find that, having lost the entitlement to an 80 per cent rebate and having been faced with a number of charges that accrue, he faces a bill three or four times larger than originally envisaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tackled the Secretary of State on my next point before but I have received no satisfactory answers. I hope that he will recognise that there is a real difficulty in keeping to the 1993 timetable in England, but not such an acute difficulty in Scotland. Anyone who reads the professional journals or has read the Audit Commission report, which said that the English target "may be achievable" will recognise that we could kill off the poll tax in Scotland in April 1993, but that the English will not be able to do it before April 1994. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"there may be grounds for optimism that arrangements for the new tax could be in place in Scotland by April 1993, whatever the problems which may be encountered elsewhere in the United Kingdom in meeting this deadline."</p></blockquote>
What I want from the Secretary of State is not the bland denial that I got the other day from the hon. Member for Eastwood, who said that the problem may not arise. Everyone knows that it might arise. I want the Secretary of State to guarantee that, if the problem does arise, he will not mark time to save the blushes of the right hon. Member for Henley and that he will abolish the poll tax in Scotland at the earliest opportunity. That abolition should happen earlier in Scotland than in England. Nobody in Scotland would consider that demand risible or inappropriate, given that we got the poll tax a year earlier than the rest of the country.

The major problem is that the financial system and the local government restructuring proposals may have been designed to undermine local democracy, which

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
has long been in the firing line with this Conservative Government. The following, from the impeccable source of the Audit Commission, was written about England, but I believe that it applies to Scotland:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The low proportion of expenditure now to be raised by local taxation, combined with the very high gearing on tax rises, may make the system unsustainable in the long term without either extensive capping or a reduction in the functions of local government. Neither would be supported by the Commission."</p></blockquote>
I agree with that. The clear implication of the Government's action is that capping will be imposed permanently or that the powers and functions of local government will be reduced to an extent that is almost impossible to defend. The Secretary of State yesterday dismissed the suggestion that a hidden agenda is inherent in the discussion document on structure. The effects of that agenda would mean that education would fade away through the opting-out of schools, that economic planning would pass to local enterprise companies and that housing would become less important as Scottish Homes flourishes. The Secretary of State said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The hon. Gentleman related one or two changing roles in local authorities that I could not recognise. Whether they are Labour party policy I do not know."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 17 June 1991; Vol. 193, c. 36.]</p></blockquote>
I do not know whether the Secretary of State was being disingenuous or thick. Clearly, he has forgotten the contents of his own document, of which I shall be pleased to remind him. Paragraph 22 of the consultation paper states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The enactment of legislation to allow schools to become self-governing points to another possible change in the discharge of the education function."</p></blockquote>
Perhaps the Secretary of State would care to examine paragraph 13, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For example, the encouragement of economic development, perceived by Lord Wheatley's Commission as a key local authority responsibility under the title of economic planning, is now largely the task of Scottish Enterprise and the LECs."</p></blockquote>
How can the Secretary of State suggest that that is Labour party policy, but not Conservative party policy, even though the consultation paper refers to it specifically? Who can believe that he does not envisage a diminution in district councils' responsibility for housing? The Secretary of State demeans himself and impedes the debate by denying what is self-evidently true and what can clearly be substantiated by reference to the Government's consultation paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we discuss these matters, we shall have to examine many unanswered questions about the delivery of services from a fragmented base. We know that the Secretary of State has talked of the fire and police services being run by joint boards. History teaches us that that is not a satisfactory solution and that in the past in has been a recipe for friction. There is time for one example only, but what is to happen to strategic planning? The Wheatley estuarial principle did not survive, but everyone agreed that there was a need for an overall view of strategic planning. The fragmentation suggested by the Secretary of State, or some of his supporters, may be the view from the Scottish Office window. That is not an attractive prospect. There is a hint that the cities will become unitary auth-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
orities. For example, taking Aberdeen out of Grampian and Edinburgh out of Lothian would create problems
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a case for establishing an independent review to define the debate, set out the options and concentrate the discussion, in the way that the apology for a consultation document fails to do. There is no point in the Secretary of State's praise for the Wheatley commission or his claim that Montgomery and Stodart did a tremendous job when he also states that that job does not need to be done. Without independent input, the proposals will be seen as partial. The local goverment world is unanimous about that. I know that the Secretary of State is not inclined to listen to the Labour party about such matters, but perhaps he will listen to a brave group of political refugees—the Conservative group on Glasgow district council, which moved a specific addendum to the council's resolution, advocating an independent commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
COSLA invited me and representatives from other parties to a meeting. We found ourselves sitting in a room with local government representatives, including some from Eastwood, who unanimously favoured an independent commission. I warn the Secretary of State that his idea that consensus will be easily achieved is wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the hon. Member for Eastwood has seen the quotation in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> on 18 April from Mr. Ian Hutchison, a respected member of the Conservative party, who said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The matter came before Eastwood District and we decided to write directly to Ian Lang. At this point in time, we feel there is no justification for change. We see no reason for it … We have had no difficulty with Strathclyde in 15 years … We have always had a good working relationship with Strathclyde which has done a very good job."</p></blockquote>
I quote that as a corrective to the easy assumption in Eastwood that Strathclyde has not done a good job and should go. Perhaps reorganisation is necessary in that area, but it should not be based on prejudice. The hon. Member for Eastwood is a rebel in his own constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the Secretary of State's attention to an article published on 18 March. I concede that that was some time ago, but it was published after the discussion document on local finance appeared. The article was written by the vice-president of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Association, Mr. Brian Meek. He complained:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Every day, it would appear, the Government has a new notion for doing something to or with our present council structure … Now it seems there is another Tory scheme. This one abolishes regions, gives power over education, police, and roads to central Government, and leaves a structure of district councils, some the size of Glasgow and others hardly more than a row of semi-detached. I would definitely like the cost of this spelled out.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>For the plan has the smell of the broken-hearted right about it and they have done the party enough harm."</p></blockquote>
I am glad that the hon. Member for Eastwood recognises the reference. The article continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I happen to care about local democracy; I believe councils, sometimes, have to challenge Government diktats; I want able, elected people, not Government-sponsored poodles, to take local decision."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0310">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
Mr. Meek is right. Such principles will have to be defended against Government proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know that there is a case for reform—that is Labour party policy. There is a strong case for unitary, single-tier, all-purpose authorities. However, the Opposition would view them as part of a wider, general reform, which would strengthen democracy. Setting up a Scottish Parliament in a United Kingdom framework would pass power from central bureaucracy to the people. It is a deliberate misrepresentation to suggest that a Scottish Parliament, drawing its power exclusively from Westminster and bringing it to Scotland, is a further centralisation measure and a threat to local democracy. Conservative party policies have constituted the real threat to local democracy. No one doubts that. The Opposition are not prepared to support any scheme that whittles away the essential power of local communities to run their own affairs. We will not support any scheme that leaves councils hogtied, cabined and confined, with control over only 14 per cent of what they spend. That is a negation of the principles that the Secretary of State bravely set out in the opening pages of his discussion document. He is blind if he does not see that. Well-founded suspicions about his motives remain. The danger is that reform will be dictated by the need of Ministers to escape from the embarrassment of the poll tax. Our commitment must be to a just and permanent settlement and to a sound foundation on which local government can build securely for the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was lucky enough to be a county councillor from 1952 onwards, operating within the old system which had both small and large boroughs. I had a great deal of respect for that system. In some ways, with the exception of the very small boroughs, I can see us working back towards the situation that existed before 1973.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One is very concerned about the attitude of the boundary commissioners to local government in rural constituencies. Where does their writ lie and who has written their terms of reference? They seem hell bent on making certain that every local government boundary contains the same numerical electorate as the others. Therefore, the idea that communities and parishes should stick together has gone by the board. That is most unsatisfactory. Why are we trying to achieve equality in the size of local government constituencies when we are not prepared to do so for parliamentary constituencies? I accept that some seats in Glasgow and in the borders are very small compared with others, yet I am unhappy with that the boundary commissioners are trying to do to local authority boundaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>

The hon. Gentleman's point is well founded in that rural areas or others with a small population must be considered in any reorganisation. Was not the hon. Gentleman perturbed when the Secretary of State said to my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Ewing) that there would probably be fewer local councillors under the new proposals? I assume that the hon. Gentleman will be sticking to the most important point—that it would mean less democracy if, in the reorganisation, all the little areas that he is trying to defend, lost their local councillor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point. I am not so sure that there will be a significant drop in the number of councillors in the ultimate scheme. We must have local representation, in which local councillors will have an important part to play. We must also consider the community councillors who play an important part in filling in for the small areas which do not have the influence that they had in the old days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the local authorities in my area responded to the COSLA inquiry and not one wanted to adopt a system of proportional representation, including the local authority that has a Liberal Democrat majority. There is some misunderstanding somewhere in that party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The structure is the most important matter to get right. The feeling now is that decisions on services should be taken at the lowest level. That should build in a degree of accountability. The longer I am in Parliament and the longer I am involved in local affairs, the less sure I am that accountability in local elections is as straightforward as people think.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a lot to be said for the leadership given by the old, small boroughs. Most of the councillors were non-political and independent and the provost was the leader of the community. In my parliamentary work, it was valuable to be able to call the provost and ask about the feeling in a particular town and to know that when I went to meet the town council the provost would be chairing the meeting. The provost had an executive role to play as well as being a councillor, unlike community councillors today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The loss of a local forum at a lower level than district or region is one of the things that is missed today. I am worried about how the single-tier authority will translate into a low tier, such as the old boroughs or current community councils. The latter do not have executive powers and the old boroughs do not exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has shown a high degree of flexibility. I am not

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
yet convinced by any one solution. There are many variations throughout Scotland that must be considered. In some regions, one option may be more appropriate than another. The success of the island councils has shown that. What may be successful for Dumfries and Galloway may not fit in Strathclyde or central Lothian.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Wheatley commission took a long time—rightly—to come to a conclusion. There were many distinguished people on that commission. As the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said, the estuarial theory has never worked in practice, but it did have an impact on the drawing of the map. I am sure that if we had not been tied to that theory, we would have made Ayrshire a region by itself in the 1970s. Once Fife was made into a region, it showed that great strategic planning was not as important as some people made out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local planning is desperately important. If one reads the minutes of local councils, one can see that it is rare for them to follow a strategic plan. They look at local issues. We must not be tied to the idea that strategic planning is of immense importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other hon. Members have mentioned sewerage, water and other services. Those are provided on a broad scale, but they can still be planned on a local scale. In my region, unlike many others in Scotland, the districts do not have planning powers. I know that the districts feel a lack of authority that they would like to have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, we have both regional and district authorities. If we adopt a one-tier region, through what operational forum will the lower tier be able to influence the people in charge? If the districts are designated as the authority, it is inevitable that joint committees will be set up for education, police, fire and possibly for water. If that were so, we would be back to regions by another name. That is not a practical way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the old county council days, when I was chairman of the police committee, there were a few joint committees. They worked very well and there was no disharmony. I am worried about how we are to translate a single tier to the local echelons where the work is carried out. The districts were looked at by Stodart. Little change was made. At that time the districts in my area were reluctant to take on planning, although they are anxious to do so now. They also want to get involved in industrial development and with a local enterprise company and the region is keen to get involved in the health service. There are numerous cross-council views on how we should proceed. During the consultation process we should concentrate on trying to get the structure right rather than on finance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about the staff employed by local authorities, which are probably the largest employers in Scotland. All the staff will be concerned about their long-term future. In a year or more, when the lengthy consultation process is complete, we should proceed more quickly. If the local government system is to be in place by 1996, many local authority employees will have had five years in which to worry about the impli-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
cations of the change. We should give special consideration to the staff who do an excellent job and we should not underestimate their worries about losing their jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we shall legislate no later than 1993 even if we cannot manage to do so by the winter of 1992. To hold the matter in abeyance for too long will not help the general economic development of Scotland. It will hang over us and concern many councillors from all parties. There is much to be said for moving cautiously in rural areas such as mine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is not a great deal wrong with the present structure. I accept that it may not be right for large regions such as Strathclyde and we must bear in mind the difficulties that the Secretary of State has had over finance. We cannot claim that the present system is a great success. We must return to good housekeeping and try to keep expenditure down rather than finding ways to spend money and bumping up local taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the Secretary of State has produced his consultation paper. Do not let us underestimate our task; let us consult in depth before we make any change because any change must be for the better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member for Dumfries (Sir. H. Monro) because I agree with much of what he said. I detected that he views the change with a degree of trepidation. I share that view. If there is a case to be made for substantial reform of local government, it must be made by those who want the reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although, unlike the hon. Gentleman, I was not a serving councillor, my experience in the Borders, an area similar to Dumfries and Galloway, leads me to believe that the system works reasonably well. The new proposals for change condemn the whole system to a long period of uncertainty which will compound present difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say without antagonism that I was disappointed with the Secretary of State's speech this morning—I put it no more strongly than that. He did not reflect the balance of opinion in local government or the worries faced by the people involved. It was unnecessary to indulge in 10 minutes of party political banter. We could have done without that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government must address the short-term financial situation of local Government. If we leave aside the more difficult areas of Strathclyde and elsewhere, my own local authority is finding it very difficult to collect efficiently outstanding arrears for last year's poll tax given the high administrative costs of collecting relatively small amounts of money this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I endorse entirely what the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said about the need in short order to abolish the 80 per cent ceiling on rebates. If the Government were to introduce such a social security measure—it is not a local government measure—it would show that they recognise that there are real financial difficulties facing local authorities. If they do not do that, a heavy price will be paid in the coming months with a reduction in services and many

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
redundancies. I was disappointed that the Secretary of State did not advert to that urgent matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said yesterday that I was worried that the tone of the document published yesterday is all about local government as an enabler and a provider of services. It concentrates on the collection of rubbish and other such matters. Nothing in the document gives confidence to anyone who believes in the principle of local democracy providing an effective voice through local councillors for local communities. That goes for what the Secretary of State said yesterday as well. That is worrying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be a case for arguing that in certain circumstances local authorities should become enablers and providers of services in some of the ways proposed by the Government. Taken in the context of the history of the past 10 years, local authorities do not trust central Government any more. That is largely because the revenue support grant has been reduced so dramatically over that time. The Secretary of State is right to say that service provision has gone up and that more kids are staying on at school and so on. All that can be explained by demographic changes. Many kids stay on at school because they cannot get jobs and have to stay on. His statistics are suspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most important thing for the Committee to grasp is that there has been a dramatic change, in the wrong direction, in the relationship between local and central Government. If it continues, it will lead to local authorities being little more than local agencies for central authority. The Government must be careful about what they do. They will end up with far more centralised power at Westminster than is healthy for naybody, including central Government. We must reconsider how the relationship between central and local Government has evolved over the past 10 years and how it will evolve further as a result of the changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is essential that the Government make an early statement along the lines of the proposed principles of local government published by COSLA as a guide to what it thinks should give local authorities the necessary future protection from central Government. It talks about enshrining local authorities' ability to speak for their local communities and of a power of general competence to act on behalf of local authorities on matters not specifically excluded or assigned to another authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities must, of course, be constrained in terms of what they can spend and I do not deride the sovereignty of Parliament. However, the balance is wrong and the tone of the Government's papers and their case for the new system imply that the democratic rights of local authorities will be further eroded, as the hon. Member for Garscadden said. If the argument against that erosion is not stressed in our discussions and consultations, no one will want to serve on a local authority. There would be no point in anyone giving
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
large amounts of time and energy to the local community if everything in the local authority's jurisdiction decided at one annual meeting, which is disbanded for the rest of the year. That is the fear that stalks town halls up and down the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am intensely worried by the background against which the changes are taking place. I appreciate that the Government had to respond to a crisis and do something about the poll tax. However, we have been landed with a package of panic measures for financing local government. We are discussing its structure but no one has considered its functions and the method of election to the council. It is wrong to undertake reforms and to take consultation in such a piecemeal way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
John Mackintosh, a distinguished former Member of Parliament for Berwick and East Lothian said that it was essential to consider the finance, structure, functions and methods of election in the round if the constitutional structure was to stand the test of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I am reassured that the Secretary of State nods his head. What I advocate does not equate with what is happening. A new system of single-tier authorities would make the relationship between local government and a future Scottish Parliament much easier. There would be one less tier of Government, which would remove one of the Secretary of State's arguments against a Parliament in Edinburgh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Secretary of State will not dismiss the case made by Opposition Members who believe in a Scottish Parliament and that he will allow proper discussion of the future structure of local government in Scotland in that context. Liberal Democrats and, formerely, the Scottish Liberal party, argued consistently for a Parliament based in Edinburgh and for decentralised decision-making in Scotland. We accept the merits of a system of single-tier authorities but we want a better partnership between central and local government. Recently, we argued for a local income tax as the system of local government finance. I hope that the Secretary of State will continue to listen to arguments about the merits of a local income tax, which we believe has a part to play.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Garscadden that the Government's proposed system of local government finance is doomed to a life span as short as that of the poll tax. A system that producess only 14 per cent of local authority revenue is inadequate and will not last. The council tax proposal will not stand the test of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No single change would have a larger or more dramatic impact on increasing the accountability of local authority decision making than changing the system of electing local authorities by introducing some form of proportionality. That would remove established, entrenched heartlands of whatever party and introduce a system of accommodating and reconciling the different party positions at council level. That in itself would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0313">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
make it easier to sustain the relationship between central and local government. No longer would the entrenched party political confrontation be repeatedly argued out in different parts of the country. We must not lose sight of the advantages that would flow from introducing proportionality into the electoral system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a suggestion for the Secretary of State. I have not canvassed the idea with my colleagues, but I was considering it last night after yesterday's exchanges. If the Secretary of State wants effective consultation on his plans, why not consider, for next May's district elections, adopting the American system Of having a referendum—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Why not ask local people when they go to polls what they think about what combination of structures is right for their area? The Government must remember that consultation and local options are essential for deciding the structure of local authorities. If we do not create a system that meets the needs of localities such as Borders and Dumfries, the consultation exercise and the process of reform on which the Government are embarking are bound to fail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.4 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I noticed this morning that the Minister of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), was very happy. On his way out, I was sure that I detected him whistling that famous tune, "Chicago, Chicago, it's my kind of town". I had intended to ask the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) about it. That came to mind because, with the council tax and the new structure of local government, we are dealing with the remnants of the previous Prime Minister's regimes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I follow my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) in welcoming the abandonment of the poll tax. However, I ask that the Government should immediately introduce 100 per cent rebates for people on income support. Such people are disappointed, as was confirmed to me in my constituency surgery last week, that they are not to receive the £140 rebate. They will receive only a meagre pittance and that is already causing heartbreak. The Secretary of State, having conceded the principle, should accept 100 per cent rebates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State should allow further backdating of the rebate entitlement. I have dealt with many cases in my constituency that involved the 56-day rule. Only two weeks ago, after five or six months of negotiations with the poll tax officer, I obtained a rebate of £200 each for an elderly couple. Their problem arose because they ran foul of the 56-day rule. That matter should now be dealt with. The exemption of students from liability should also be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the mess that has existed since April, the Secretary of State for the Environment should consider compensating authorities for their loss of income since 1 April 1991. I have been informed that in the new
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
grant year, Strathclyde regional council has collected only £40,000, which puts them in a grave financial position. The 20 per cent minimum payment should be abolished. We are in the dying days of the poll tax and it is incredible that this matter, which affects mainly poor people, is not being dealt with. The rebate process should be simplified by bringing the tapers for the council tax and housing benefit into line with each other. There is no reason why that cannot be done now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I concede that the council tax is fairer than the poll tax, but it is a long way from being fair. It is not as progressive in practice as it is in theory. The Secretary of State for the Environment, the right hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Heseltine), has been mentioned. He will pay £227 on his house in Westminster—less than any couple in Scotland would pay and certainly less than a struggling couple in a terraced house in my constituency. A system that allows that is far from fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Economists reckon that for a tax to be progressive, it is not sufficient for the rich to pay more as a proportion of their income than the poor. For instance, the income tax system is progressive. Someone on £50,000 per annum earns five times as much as someone on £10,000 per annum. However, the person on £50,000 would pay nine times more than the person on £10,000 per annum. That is "progressivity". The council tax is not progressive because people at the top of the payment scale pay only 2.5 times as much as those at the bottom. The council tax is a blunt instrument. The slogan will be, "He who pays the piper calls the tune"—and we know it is the Government who are calling the tune. The council tax will not be the long-term solution to the problems of local government while 86 per cent of revenue is given by central Government and only 14 per cent is collected by local government. That is a recipe for chaos and the demise of the council tax. It will go the same way as the poll tax if the anomalies are not resolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State referred to one of them when he stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is no change to the Government's policy on non-domestic rates, where we retain our aim of harmonising rates in Scotland with those in the rest of Great Britain."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 21 March 1991; Vol. 188, c. 461.]</p></blockquote>
There is a case for the inclusion of non-domestic rates in the council tax to broaden its income base. If the Secretary of State has the cheek to mention harmonisation, he should tell us when the system will be harmonised in Scotland. Businesses in Scotland are being penalised each and every day by the present system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A recent article in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> examined the banding of the council tax in Edinburgh. For people in the lowest property band earning £5,000 a year, tax was 8.4 per cent of earnings. For people on £75,000 a year, the tax was 1.4 per cent of average earnings. I spoke to a young constituent only the other day. He has an annual salary of £2,950 and will be paying a poll tax bill that amounts to 10.5 per cent of his income. I ask the Secretary of State again is that fair? Is it progressive? Politicians tell him that it is not, as do the professionals.

At the local government conference in Scotland on 29 May this year, the controller of audit accounts for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0314">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
the Commission for Local Authority Accounts in Scotland spoke about the unfairness of the banding. He fears that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the banding concept falls into a number of traps which were better to have been avoided. These are the pitfalls of subjectivity contained in any capital valuation … and unfairness when it is realised that properties with values just on either side of the band will be valued and classified differently whereas properties at extreme ends of the same band will pay the same tax."</p></blockquote>
There will undoubtedly be many appeals about banding, many more than the Secretary of State will admit. The controller adds that the Government,
	<br><blockquote><p>"by cutting off the upper band at £106,000 has left itself open to accusations of cushioning the burden on those whose very expensive houses are a clear guide to the householder's ability to pay a lot more than the average. I think this will generate some emotion when it is finally understood, and put pressure on the appeals system."</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden mentioned the subject of revaluations, which the Secretary of State felt he did not need to consider. Again, the professionals tell him that unless revaluations are kept up to date they will gradually discredit the new tax in the same way as in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I received a briefing paper recently from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in Scotland and it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"After the initial banding of properties, some provision for revaluation would, it is submitted, be essential … Limiting revaluations to only those properties changing hands would also very rapidly lead to inconsistencies, with similar properties in the same street attracting different tax liabilities, purely as a result of the pattern of sales. There could be a disincentive on household mobility if a move automatically triggered a revaluation for tax purposes."</p></blockquote>
Obviously the Government are trying to do it this way to avoid the pain caused by the quinquennial revaluations of the past, when the blue-rinse Tory brigade decided that enough was enough with rates. The same flaws are being put in this system. Unless the Government adopt a system with regular revaluations, say every three years, the iniquity of people in one street paying different values for their council tax will be driven home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Also, the gearing problem in this tax is serious. I spoke to the chief executive of my district council this week. The council is worried about the gearing system whereby, on average, a 1 per cent increase in poll tax levels will require a 7 per cent increase in the entire budget. The Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy said that that will discredit the system because it will send out misleading signals to local taxpayers about their local authority's spending plans. The Government have given us no information. This aspect of gearing is inconsistent with the requirements of grant aid for a highly geared local tax system. Grant should move in line with inflation. It should not be used as tool to lever more efficiency. It should be distributed on a stable basis. Sadly, the consultative paper that the Government have given out makes no reference to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities have had to put up with a tremendous amount of administrative detail in the past few weeks. They have done a heroic job and I pay tribute to my own poll tax officers in that regard. Day in, day out, they have been faced with administrative chaos and they have coped with it immensely well. What position
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
will they be in when the tax is in place? The challenge to them is to introduce a new tax system, maintain the existing community charge and collection system and arrange for the abolition and replacement of existing authorities—all within three years. That is utter nonsense. In addition, the next two or three years will be dominated by the phasing out of the poll tax, which will still have to be collected during that period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, the professionals say that ideally there should be a period of one and a half to two years between the enactment of the proposals and their implementation. To achieve implementation in 1993–94, the primary and secondary legislation must be in place by the end of 1991, or there will be administrative, chaos.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the discounts of 50 per cent for single people, the paper proposes that if the first or second adult in a household is a student, student nurse, apprentice, youth trainee or currently exempt from the community charge, the council tax payable will be reduced by a personal discount for each—that is, the bill will be discounted by 25 per cent or 50 per cent. That is another source of concern because of the danger of introducing into the new tax many of the complexities which led to the downfall of the poll tax. An annual basis of liability in such cases would be virtually impossible to police and a daily basis is undesirable from an administrative point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal will also lead to pressure for more and more categories to qualify for discounts. For example, many people whose income is less than that of nurses or apprentices will plead unfairness. In the absence of a register of adults, the professional bodies state that the administration of those discounts will be a nightmare. Sadly, the Government have still not paid any attention to that point. Those are the problems affecting the council tax, which the Government should consider and the Secretary of State should refer to when he winds up the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other aspect of this debate is reform. I agree with members of the Committee who have said that a Royal Commission is essential. There is a notion abroad that the move to single-tier authorities is necessary and will be painless. I remember the Government saying that the introduction of the poll tax would be painless. The Government painted a picture of a wonderful world in which people would accept with equanimity the blatant inconsistencies of the poll tax. But the Government's romantic world fell apart with the chaos of the poll tax. It will be the same with the reform of local government if the Government do not consult other people and interested bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State told the recent COSLA conference that the conventional wisdom was that the regions were big and bureaucratic. Where is the evidence for that statement? I am not against a review of local government, but before we go headlong into one, I want to know the present pitfalls and how the Goverment intend to overcome them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are introducing this system because they are running scared. There will be no Royal Commission because it would give many people the opportunity to put their point of view. The issue of devolution might arise and might look attractive.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0315">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
Given the Conservatives minority position in Scotland, the Government cannot afford that, so they deny us that opportunity to look again at restructuring local government finance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that the size of the regional councils brings advantages. First, it means that there is a broader tax base—which the Government are currently limiting—giving councils the opportunity to undertake large-scale investment and concentrate their expenditure on priorities. I well remember when I was teaching in a school in the mid-1970s, we were under the old local authorities. Our school was 40 per cent under staffed and individuals were given a minuscule amount of money for teaching in an understaffed school—I think that it was £120. Given that the school had more than 1,000 boys, that money did not help much because it was extra staff that was required. However, when Strathclyde regional council came into being, it was able to use the advantage of its size in implementing strategic planning and to sort out the problems in education and provide us with fully staffed schools. I fear that the atomisation involved in a return to smaller authorities could cause the problems that we eliminated in the 1970s to reappear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same is true for the problems of water and sewage. The larger council is able to prioritise its spending. The Secretary of State mentioned the wasteful duplication of resources, but that argument was seriously weakened by the 1982 Stodart review, which rationalised most of the concurrent functions. The Secretary of State is therefore wrong to say that resources are being wasted. Bureaucracy is unavoidable, but today it accounts for only 2 or 3 per cent of total expenditure in regional councils of a sufficient size. That does not seem too high a price to pay, especially when compared to the cost of, say, health care in the United States of America, where burearcracy takes up to 10 to 15 per cent of spending. We get a good deal from our local authorities. Those who say that we do not provide no information to support their argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Research into local government for the Widdicombe committee revealed that a large majority of people were in favour of their local authority. The Scottish public were satisfied with their local authorities and the services that they provided, and supported their local government institutions. In contrast, only 12 per cent of Scots are in favour of the new council tax. The Government review must recognise that people are, by and large, happy with the present system of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also consider the democratic effect of change. Perhaps single-tier authorities will downgrade the power of local government. Although there may be an argument for centralising services on the grounds of efficiency, that argument cannot be defended on democratic grounds. The Government's review must be accompanied by a royal commission. The present reorganisation is centrally driven. Local government is a necessary part of a pluralist system. Other than Parliament, it is the only way in which people are
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
represented. Europe today is a Europe of regions and we shall not play our full part in that unless we understand the importance of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives stated that the case for strategic planning is as strong today as it was 15 years ago. Our strategic expertise has been used to attract money from Europe. Strathclyde regional council has done extremely well in that respect, not simply because of the personalities of its councillors but because it is of a sufficient size to have an input in Europe. The atomisation of that authority will take away that ability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chief executives of the local authorities have also spoken about the principles that must be addressed if there is to be a reform of local government. The Secretary Of State has not made a clear statement of local government's role in the next century. The relationship between central and local government must be made clear and there must be proposals for a financial base that sustains local accountability. The ratio of 86 per cent to 14 per cent does not meet that requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must value our councillors, irrespective of party. They should receive better payment for their work. At present, their role is being and if the Government persist with their plans, marginalised, people of the proper quality will not be attracted to the job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should take evidence from a wide variety of groups. I examined the Spanish model for devolution recently. Spain started from almost nothing after Franco in the mid-1970s. The Spanish economy is now vibrant. Spain's constitution of 1978 established a principle of indissoluble unity, but granted autonomy to communities. In 1979, the statutes of the first of 17 autonomous communities were approved by referendum. I realise that a referendum is not acceptable to the Government, but Spain was on its knees in the 1970s. It is now locked into Europe, has a flourishing economy and achieves many things that we do not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State should not make a decision in the Scottish Office with his three or four parliamentary colleagues, because they do not represent the opinion of Scottish people. The Secretary of State should be bold: he should establish a royal commission and allow public interest to triumph over political expediency. Let us hear the voice of the people before such crucially important decisions on the future structure of local government are taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all agree that the poll tax is dead, but its burial is taking a long time. Everyone in the opposition parties agrees that the 20 per cent rule should be abolished and that people on benefit should not be attacked. We should try to persuade local authorities to do what Grampian region has done and not exercise their discretion. The hon. Member for Garscadden wishes to return to 1985 and update the rates. However, he also asks the Secretary of State to hurry up and introduce the council tax. Would a Labour Government abolish the council tax or halt all operations on it if they came to power between now and 1993?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party states that it would not cap local authorities. However, its members also state that local authorities should raise a substantially greater sum than the 14 per cent that they now raise from their own resources. In that case, what will happen to the non-domestic rates section? That should be clarified. The whole Scottish business community demands an answer. Both Conservative and Labour parties have argued that the Scottish business community is disadvantaged to the tune of £400 million per annum by the lack of a level playing field throughout Britain. I do not expect immediate answers. Perhaps the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton), who will reply for the Opposition, will try to supply them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, I am getting into my anecdotage. The Secretary of State too seems to be embarking on his.—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] However, the sprightly figure of the hon. Member for Garscadden has just left the Room. The Secretary of State was engaged in reminiscing. Few of us will remember the last debates on the Floor of the House and in Committee on Wheatley and the reform of local government. The then Secretary of State for Scotland, Gordon Campbell, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am sure that our successors will bless us if we bequeath a system which means that it will be a very long time before local Government in Scotland has to be reorganised again." [	<i>Official Report,</i> 4 December 1972; Vol. 847, c.925]</p></blockquote>
The previous system lasted nearly 50 years; the current system has lasted under 20. A Tory Government are embarking on a re-examination without the background of a commission or a long detailed survey—it was 10 years or more before we introduced the changes last time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps there is great wisdom in the Scottish Office, and when all the submissions are considered there will emerge a system of local government that suits the needs of the years post-2000, as the Secretary of State put it. This time there is an ostensible difference: we are examining local government and local government finance simultaneously. There was an error in the proposals last time when the broad aims were widely agreed both by Labour and the Tories. Few in the Labour party dared to challenge the orthodoxy of the day. I should not refer disparagingly to the dead. I have great respect for Lord Ross of Marnock, Willie Ross as he was then, but—and the hon. member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) might share this view—the whole thing
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
was draconian. John Mackintosh, a very few others and I thought of voting against the measure on Second Reading. But, my goodness, the House did not divide on Second Reading. Labour agreed with the proposals. On Third Reading we thought of doing the same. I was weak-kneed then and we did not challenge the almighty Lord Ross.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are dangers when both sides agree. We are looking for diversity. It is a matter of debate whether diversity can be considered outwith a long detailed examination by a commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One reason why it was not challenged is that a great deal was agreed with Betty Harvie Anderson and Russell Johnston, and an enormous amount of thought went into it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There were points on which there was emphatic disagreement, such as Fife. I may have some misgivings about Fife regional council, but I have no misgivings about saying that if the procedures in the Committee had not been manipulated to reverse what had been agreed, my goodness, nobody could argue that the division of Fife on the basis of an estuarial principle—an up the creek principle—could be sustained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a lot of time for the hon. Member for Linlithgow because he is by nature a dissident. He is his own many who does his own thinking. If we had been dragooned, Fife would not have been "left on its own" to be, in the main, a fairly effective region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am looking for diversity. The key area of autonomy, because of its nature and significance, is education. It is a matter for debate whether the diversity and plurality of that system is best defended at school or by the local authority. The Government put their money on the school. In my view, both the school and the local authority should be sources of independent aims, ideas and opinions against the centralising forces. In Scotland there has been an effective Scottish Education Department. It has tried to eliminate inequalities in our education system and not demanded uniformity. That is because there has been an element of local authority autonomy, especially in finance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities and schools must have real power over education and there is only one local tax capable of yielding the resources on the scale required—the local income tax. Every argument from the Opposition Front Bench—and from the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) this morning—has tried to link their intended system of taxation to ability to pay. The Opposition are jumping through hoops to criticise the Government's proposals. The hon. Member for Dumbarton argued for "progressivity" in taxation. That will not happen with a tax based on property, without enormous complications. Even if members of the Committee do not share my views on education, I hope that I can convince them of the efficacy of a local income tax, particularly in a Scottish context. I mean no disrespect to the Liberal Democrats' policy of introducing a local income tax for the whole of Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The unionist parties have argued, against a local income tax, that giving powers to local authorities to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0317">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
levy income taxes would undermine the Government's responsibility for demand management. That is a peculiar argument to come from the Government Benches. The Government have not been expert in demand management and the Opposition have no great record in that area either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be true that if local authorities could levy income tax, demand management might suffer from a United Kingdom perspective. In Scotland, with an independent Scottish Parliament elected by proportional representation, the management of economic aggregates on a Scottish basis would take on a new meaning. Effective control of finances entails a connection between the functions of the spenders and the revenue raisers. The dangers of the opposite course should be well known to the Tories. 	<i>The Spectator,</i> this week, has a report on Tory finances and the deficit of £4,376,000 for 1990. It said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Part of the loss was also due to the high-spending campaign Mr. Kenneth Baker … mounted when the party was in deep trouble at the 1990 council elections. Mr. Baker was told to spend what he needed because the money would be raised. He did, and it wasn't. The separation of revenue raisers from cash spenders is no less insane in the Tory Party than it would be in any other business."</p></blockquote>
An independent Scottish Parliament and administration in direct contact with local authorities, with agreed boundaries, functions and numbers, would have little difficulty in assessing what could be afforded compared to what was demanded to meet the needs of functions and areas. It would be more able to avoid the peril of profligacy and over-spending than the suggestion of a convention from Labour and the Tories' imposed solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party's position is less stable, both fiscally and politically, due to the build up of expectations and the current politicial balance in Scotland. We are told that all will be solved by supply-side initiatives, if the right hon. and learned Member for Monklands, East (Mr. Smith) knows what supply side means. I mean no disrespect to him, but, he is not present, while we are discussing these important matters. Any solution to local authority finance under a unionist scheme will be dictated by the Treasury. Supply-side financiing will have demand-side implications. If the Labour party intends to rely on training and education to sove the problems, that has to be financed and that financing has demand implications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am amazed that the Tories put on the mantle of Adam Smith, but deploy the arguments of John Maynard Keynes against a local income tax. They think that the ability of the capitalist system to deliver goods and services, which is a modern and somewhat limited credence, has lasted a long time, but some of us have long memories. We can remember when the capitalist system did not deliver and did not alleviate poverty in places such as Govan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I can be whimsical for a moment—some advance was made when Matt McGinn could write, "you cannae throw pieces oot a 20-storey flat." In my time, we could not throw pieces out of a three-stair tenement window because there was no bread in the house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of my remarks is to argue for local government reform on a single-tier basis and to relate it
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
to a local income tax. Tories think that the ability to provide goods and services outside the market can be achieved only by exerting draconian powers over local authorites to deprive them of their ability to provide such goods and services. Other nations with high standards of living allow much greater local initiatives and finance considerable proportions of local expenditure by means of local income tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not an exaggeration to state that the only way to preserve local autonomy and democracy in Scotland is to obtain our independence and get a Scottish Parliament with local authorities agreeing on a local income tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local democracy will continue to be undermined by both Tories and Labour Members and it is up to the Scottish people, in the interests of democracy and good Government, to end this attack on our way of life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last local government organisational reforms have apparently lasted for a mere 20 years. The poll tax lasted two years too long. Both reforms were imposed from above. Surely we have learnt the lesson.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I told the hon. Member for Cunninghame, South (Mr. Lambie) that I would refer to him. On 4 December 1972, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"if we cannot get people from Scotland to exert influence on the English Treasury we must move the Scottish part of the Treasury back to Edinburgh … that is where we shall have the regional authority, with a Scottish Treasury. The next logical step is self-government for Scotland. We do not want to see all the traditions of local government in Scotland murdered to satisfy the whims of one or two financial experts down in London, when we can save the whole of Scotland's economy and her traditions by saying, "Bring the money and the power back to Edinburgh.".—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 4 December 1972; Vol. 847, c. 1022.]</p></blockquote>
That was true then. I regret that at that time, I did not object to what was proposed on the basis of the unity of parties. The most effecive unity party was the Communist party because it had no independence of thought.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dunfermline, West (Mr. Douglas) made a good case for local income tax and I agree with much of what he said. I much prefer the position taken by his former colleague, Jim Fairlie. Jim Fairlie is prepared to meet the cost of independence whatever it is. He will not support the meaningless slogans of local income tax linked to independence in Europe, which he believes is humbug. There is substantial truth in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate my hon. Friend the Minister on his proposals for a single-tier local authority, for the reduction of the level of the community charge and the transfer of that part of local authority funding to value added tax. They formed part of the recommendations in my paper and I support them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much has been made of the fact that in some areas, the community charge is not coming in—this is politely called "arrears" but it is non-payment. When the Minister winds up the debate on Thursday, will he confirm a report that is circulating in my constituency that a substantial number of regional and district council employees have failed to pay their community charge? If the report is true, what do the Government intend to

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
do to ensure that those paid from the public purse in Tayside pay their lawful local community charge? Whatever their views, they cannot excuse themselves on the basis that they cannot afford to pay, because they are in safe council jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) spoke about the proposed property banding. The Government are right to consider structure and funding at the same time. To do either in isolation would cause difficulties. I believe that the average length of a mortgage on a home is about six or seven years—the building societies will let me know if I am wrong. Let us, therefore, consider the three similar properties mentioned by the hon. Member for Garscadden. One sells three times; and the people who buy the property and move in realise that its value—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Hon. Members may find this amusing but it is a serious matter. I do not argue with some of the points made by the hon. Member for Garscadden but we must carefully examine the details. People know the price that they are prepared to pay for a property and therefore, that the property will automatically be in the relevant band. I would be horrified if that were not so: the value of anything is what it will fetch on the open market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the time of purchase, it is essential that the purchaser knows the score—that the band into which the property falls will depend on the price at which it is sold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Garscadden mentioned the pensioner couple next door who, we assume, have lived in their house for some time and moved in knowing what the band would be. They also know that it will not change until they move. The hon. Member for Garscadden wants help for those in that situation, but they know what their future commitments are and are already in the band. That is the best way to help people who do not want to leave their family home. Such people would not face the horrors that were caused by revaluation. If I am correct about the length of time that individuals stay in homes with a mortgage, the turnover in the marketplace will be linked to those who can afford to pay. The market, if it is left alone, will provide the answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Garscadden linked the issue of single all-purpose authorities with his call for an assembly. That is an honourable position. I disagree with it, but it is important. We must examine its viability. I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman who first raised the west Lothian question is in the Room. He will know that there are people in his party who, according to Isobel Lindsay in a letter to 	<i>The Scotsman,</i> think that the west Lothian question is not urgent. She says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"No action would be taken to reduce the number of Scottish MPs or restrict their voting rights for several years at least after the establishment of a Scottish parliament since only a Conservative Government would have a vested interest in so doing."</p></blockquote>
She had better tell that to English Members of Parliament, who would not be happy about Scots Members voting on controversial matters, regardless of their political party. Isobel Lindsay, in dealing with the west Lothian question and the Secretary of State's role, which she considers to be minor problem, continues:
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is now developing a lengthy argument about devolution and constitutional reform. Today's debate is on local government finance. We will have an opportunity to discuss the other matters next week. I know that those subjects are related, but perhaps the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no intention of entering the debate on devolution, but when 86 per cent of the local government is centrally funded it is impossible to ignore the issue. This is a debate on local government funding. When 86 per cent of that funding comes from central Government, central Government—this House and this Parliament—has an interest in how Scottish local authorities are funded. Therefore, according to Isobel Lindsay,
	<br><blockquote><p>"While these issue can be satisfactorily answered, they are marginal in the context of the huge shift of power to a democratic Scottish parliament which the convention proposals represent."</p></blockquote>
I shall not proceed further down that path except to note this. The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have taken the lessons contained in it"—</p></blockquote>
Lord Barnett's book—
	<br><blockquote><p>"very much to heart and a future Labour Government will not borrow for revenue expenditure, as happened in the past."</p></blockquote>
That is relevant to both the 86 per cent and 14 per cent figures. The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"That mistake was made by the last Labour Government, and it was a mistake which we do not intent to repeat."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 14 June 1991; Vol. 192, c. 1211.]</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was present at debate. That comment was relevant to many other things, including the London zoo.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is aware that he and I were present throughout that debate. He is not disputing what was said, which was in reply to a question that I put directly to the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East. I did not intend to quote my question, but because of what has been said, I shall do so. I asked:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Does the hon. Gentleman intend to refer to borrowing? Is he aware that borrowing is simply deferred taxation? It is easier to defer and let somebody else pay the tax, as the last Labour Government did. If borrowing were included in his equation, what would be the impact?"—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 14 June 1991; Vol. 192, c. 1211]</p></blockquote>
I have already quoted the hon. Gentleman's reply.

We must consider structure and finance together. I have already dealt, within the narrow limit of the debate, with the conventions proposals. I should like to say more, but I shall deal instead with a matter that concerns me and many others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I promote and support the idea of single all-purpose authorities. Strategic planning cannot be pushed under the carpet in the hope that everything will turn out right. When we restructure local government, we must bear in mind the importance of strategic planning to

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>37</span>
the future well being of Scottish citizens. Water, roads and sewerage as well as our relations with the European Community must be considered in the context of local government in Scotland. That is why I put forward my ideas on assessments. We must debate fully how we deal with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also debate more fully costs and staffing. Anyone who thinks that Scottish people want a restructure of local government an escalation in costs is not living in the real world. People in Scotland want local authority services to be related to their needs, and they want to know what the local authority in responsible for. Many people do not know how responsibilities are divided between the district council and the regional council. Under a single all-purpose authority, that problem would disappear, but staffing levels would still present a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should consider the implications of European legislation and directives when restructuring local government. That is why we must consider privatisation as a way to provide the services that local people want. Privatised Services should not be required to find employment for everyone now on the staff of local government in Scotland. Privatisation is the one way in which local authorities can reduce numbers and operates more efficiently. Direct labour organisation,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
water authorities, architects' departments and quantity surveyors' departments could all be privatised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some respects I agreed with the comments made by the hon. Member for Dunfermline, West (Mr. Douglas) on education. I must not confuse the hon. Gentleman with the other hon. Member representing Dunfermline. It is nonsense to pretend that there will not be demand-led changes. If we are to provide the education structure and schooling necessary to give our young people the opportunities that are essential, particularly in the context of the European scene, we must look carefully at what schools provide. Here I disagree with the hon. Member for Dunfermline, West. I think that Scottish schools would be best looked after by having their interests dealt with at local level. That is why schools boards were an interesting and important development. With the legislation on them now in place, we have the opportunity to give more power to people in their own areas, particularly where there is a demand for it. That is real devolution. Now that we are changing local government, it is time to give local people that power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
