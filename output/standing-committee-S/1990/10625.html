	<section>
	<div class='legislation'>CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES IN SCOTLAND</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Ian Lang)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do report to the House that the Committee has considered the matter of Constitutional Issues in Scotland.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gavin Strang 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I am glad that the Secretary of State is here this morning. He was not with us in the House in the early hours when, as a result of a disreputable parliamentary manoeuvre, the parliamentary consensus for the Natural Heritage (Scotland) Bill was destroyed—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not a matter for the Scottish Grand Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that, at the Government's second attempt to arrange this debate, we have been able to proceed with it without being blocked by the Opposition through a procedural device.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Constitutional issues in Scotland form an interesting and important subject for a debate, and within it one could roam widely over a range of topics—for example, the importance of the role of the House of Lords, the Government's negotiations on the future of Europe, or the reform of local government upon which the Government have embarked. One could talk about Scotland's representation in Europe and I hope that I shall have time to return to that topic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State explain to the Committee why the debate is being held in London rather than Edinburgh, which would be a more appropriate place to debate Scottish constitutional issues?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may not know, but in 1706 an Act of Union united the Parliaments. This is the Parliament of the United Kingdom, where these matters are properly debated. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not suggesting that he and his party regard the subject as worth debating only if it debated outside Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One could also debate the willingness of the Liberal party to do a deal with another party—almost any other party, regardless of policy or principle—in order to secure a new voting system. It would not necessarily be a fairer voting system; it is known to be potentially destabilising and it would undermine the political integrity of our Parliament. However, it is one that would just happen to favour, with a wholly disproportionate share of power, the small and largely irrelevant parties. The debate could include the separatist threat from the Scottish National party, although it is hard to discern a burning flame of passion on that issue. It too has made the first tacit admission of its declining fortunes. One of its leaders has said that it should join with the Labour party—not to secure separation,
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
although the Labour party is half-way to accepting the policy, 	<i>de facto</i> and 	<i>de jure,</i> but simply for social and economic reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Sillars 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman should be aware that I was asked a question on the BBC programme "Analysis" about our position if we did not have a mandate for independence and we faced a hung Parliament at Westminster. If we had such a mandate, that would be the end of the matter. If we did not have that mandate and we had a hung Parliament, one thing that we would not do is deal with the right hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is reassuring to learn that the flame of passion for independence and complete separation for Scotland still burns brightly, even if it is rather heavily qualified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That, and other, matters may crop up in the debate but I wish to concentrate on one issue—the deception, delusion and fraud that the Labour party are perpetrating the people of Scotland through the policies that it mistakenly and misleading groups under the general heading of devolution, a word that has long since been robbed of its meaning. The word has gone stale, just as the arguments advanced in its name have long congealed. It has been hijacked to disguise the Labour party's plans for the advance of socialism. Good devolution is the dispersal of power in a sovereign unitary state: diffusion from the centre in order to spread decision-making, to strengthen democracy and to enhance the unity of the state. However, under the malign distortions of Labour Governments, the concept has been soured and deformed into a bogus and ersatz deceit of which George Orwell would have been proud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not be surprised, because the impulse for Labour support of devolution has no philosophical or idealistic base. Socialism is a centralising, not a devolving, force. It seeks to control and direct and not to diffuse power. The Labour party's motives in embracing devolution were two-fold; to head off the nationalists in the 1970's and to secure a local power base in Scotland because it could not secure a national power base in the United Kingdom. The concept of devolution has been corrupted in the Labour party's hands because its support for that concept springs from opportunism and self-interest. That is why Labour's policies are wrong and why that party has embarked on a route that would destroy the United Kingdom if its policies were to be put into effect. What the Labour party calls devolution is halfway to separation and partial secession and the deliberate destabilisation of the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the older Labour Members realised that and opposed devolution because they understood that it was alien to their socialist roots and because they were loyal unionists who could see the slippery slope down which their party was heading, but the younger ones, who are hungry for power have, one by one, climbed aboard. They do not care about the consequences, only about power. The non-taxing Assembly proposed in the Scotland Act which was so signably rejected by the Scottish people in 1979, has been replaced by an altogether fiercer and more damaging animal. It is no longer referred to as a Scottish Assembly but as a Scottish Parliament because the Labour party thinks that that name has more ring to it. It certainly has a ring, but it is the ring of the cash register because the body is about taxing rather than talking, levying rather than legislation and debiting rather than debating.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0205">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whatever disagreements we may have on the issue we do not dispute its importance, but, it is helpful to maintain historical accuracy in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the 1979 vote, a majority voted in favour of devolution. The idea was not as popular then as it is now, despite the background of opposition of many Labour Members and an intervention by Sir Alec Douglas-Home, which many people thought to imply that if they voted no they would get an improved Conservative version of devolution. It is not true that there is no basis of support for a Scottish Parliament or a Scottish Assembly; support is growing all the time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has obviously forgotten that many Members of Parliament, Labour, Liberal and others, went round Scotland saying, "If you do not vote at all, it counts as voting no", and that, as a result, two-thirds of the Scottish electorate did not support a Scottish Assembly and less than one third-did—falling far short of the 40 per cent qualifying rule proposed by Labour Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we have advanced down the slippery slope because the Labour Party has set up its Scottish Constitutional Convention—that gathering of the "Unco' Good"—and taken the Liberals along for a ride. The relationship between the Liberals and the Labour Party reminds me of the rhyme, "Will you step into my parlour, said the spider to the fly? I know you want P.R., you can have it when pigs can fly". Perhaps the Scottish National party should now join the Convention. It feels at home now that the Labour party is laying into its hands. However, that Convention failed to address any of the real issues. It failed to deal with the question of west Lothian. It failed to deal with the question of the number of Members to be sent to this House. It failed to deal with the position of the Secretary of State for Scotland in the United Kingdom Parliament, although we are at least helped by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) on that matter. Under the heading
	<br><blockquote><p>"Dewar would quit Commons for Scots parliament" in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> on 31 January, the hon. Gentleman is quoted as saying.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"There will be movement, and therefore innovation. There will be a need for agility and there will be a great deal of confusion, all that is bound to happen."</p></blockquote>
That is certainly true.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the convention's complete failure to come to grips with any of the central issues, although there is a sexist insistence that half the members should be women, the Labour party and its holier-than-thou alter ego now proclaims a tax-raising Assembly as the panacea, the talisman, the holy grail, the cure for all ills.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On sexism, what does the Secretary of State think of the Prime Minister's decision not to have a single woman in the Cabinet? What about the position of women in his own party, let alone in the Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the Conservative party women are promoted on merit. There are many women with merit, and no doubt in due course they will find their way into Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are presented with this crude substitute for thought, this stultifying, febrile, turbid proposition that if only we had a tax-raising body in Edinburgh, all would be for the best in the best of all possible worlds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
True devolution is not moving power from government at Westminster to government at Edinburgh—still less to the Opposition at Edinburgh—but moving power from the Government to people, from the centre to the hinterland. As such, that devolution is central to the Conservative party's philosophy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our party has put into practice true devolution. That is apparent in the creation of the Scottish Office in 1885 and in countless developments involving administrative devolution since that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We see devolution in our general approach to cutting taxation, controlling public expenditure, privatising state industries and in the more specific measures that we have introduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Garscadden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was the Liberals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it was not the Liberals. They advanced the proposition but the Conservative Government implemented it under Lord Salisbury and created the Scottish Office. We have gone on creating devolution through various administrative forms. For example, we created the new body Scottish Natural Heritage, from the Nature Conservancy Council and the Countryside Commission for Scotland, and brought it to Scotland against the opposition of the Labour party, who wanted to leave it as one body, based in Peterborough. We see devolution in our creation of Scottish Enterprise, which brings training from a United Kingdom base to a Scottish base. We have merged it with the Scottish Development Agency, and have devolved powers and 80 per cent. of the spending capacity of that body to local enterprise companies with the majority of private sector individuals on the boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We see devolution in education where, as a result of parental choice introduced by this Government, 160,000 children have been able to go to the school of their choice. We see it with the creation of school boards and the creation of councils for further education colleges and with the transfer of funding for universities from United Kingdom bases to Scotland. We see it in housing with the right to buy for tenants, with tenants' rights, with housing associations and in other ways, We see it in the setting up of executive agencies, such as Historic Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We see it in the partnerships that we have entered into, such as urban partnerships involving central Government, local government, trade unions, voluntary bodies and the private sector. We see it, too, in our approach to the citizens' charter, in which we are developing rights of redress for individuals in dealings with nationalised industries. Such rich, diverse devolution is organic and vibrant development of a democratic constitution in which freedom and unity are strengthened by the dispersal and the sharing of power. While others talk, we have acted when it counted, at both local and European level. We shall continue to act always in a way that maintains the unity of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Monday last week, I published my consultation paper on the structural change in local government. Our objective is to secure a new local government system in which the units of government reflect local loyalties and are strong, cost-effectively resourced and capable of discharging their statutory functions effectively and efficiently. We are doing that for its own sake, not as a byproduct of the creation of a tax-raising Assembly, or as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0206">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
an insult of local government in making it only secondary to the creation of an Assembly in Edinburgh, which would drain powers from local government and centralise them in Edinburgh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also acted in our relations with Europe. Some hon. Members seem to think that their call for Scotland to play a direct role in Europe is new, but surely they have noticed the achievements of the past 18 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William McKelvey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kilmarnock and Loudoun)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Secretary of State is sincere about those developments in Scotland, why did he block the establishment of the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs which would oversee such issues?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for drawing attention to another example of the Government's devolution and evolution of the constitution by their establishment of a raft of Select Committees. It is for the House of Commons, not the Government, to determine whether a Select Committee on Scottish Affairs comes into force. I should welcome such a Select Committee. My involvement in it was a formative experience in my early years in Parliament, under the chairmanship of the hon. Member for Garscadden and even more so under the chairmanship of the hon. Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hughes), who is unfortunately absent at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the United Kingdom joined the Community, Scotland has played a full part in its development. The Secretary of State for Scotland, as a member of the Cabinet, is part of the Goverenment of one of the most influential countries in the EC and ensures that Scotland plays a real role in formulating Community policy. Scotland's involvement in Community business ranges across a broad spectrum from fisheries, agriculture and industry, through a clutch of green issues to regional policy and now even touches on subjects such as health and education. Scottish businessmen, Scottish Ministers and officials are in regular contact with colleagues in Brussels, directly furthering Scottish interests in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under this Government Scotland has had many European successes to its credit. Over the past 10 years, we have had a disproportionately large share of the European structural funds. With the help of a sustained compaign of Government advice and assistance, we have secured more than £1·25 billion from those funds. Scottish businesses and financial institutions are already preparing to make a success of the single European market. In 1989–90, 55 per cent. of Scottish manufactured exports went into European Community countries—that is hardly an example of Scotland failing to take advantage of Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Commissioner Burce Milian had a meeting with some Ministers, including the Secretary of State, in which he tried to persuade the Government to come into line on additionality, particularly in relation to RECHAR. The money available from the Community under the RECHAR programme would be of great assistance to constituencies such as mine. Will the Secretary of State now convince his colleagues that there should be a change of policy to enable that money to be treated as new money—so that there is no cut in other Government expenditure—to be spent in areas such as mine where the unemployment levels are among the highest in the travel-to-work areas throughout the whole of Great Britain?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for drawing attention to my recent meeting with Commissioner Milan. In my visit to Brussels on that occasion, I also met Mr. Delors and the director-general of the fishing directorate. We discussed the RECHAR initiative and additionality with Commissioner Millan at that meeting and at subsequent meetings in London. We are pressing our cases for assistance under the RECHAR scheme and we hope that those discussions will be fruitful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The approach of the Government on additionality is the same as that of Mr. Bruce Millan when he was Secretary of State for Scotland; the policy has not changed, even though Burce Millan's policy may have changed. Other hon. Members on the Opposition Benches would like to throw out all the advantages that we secure in Europe in exchange for the empty slogan of "Independence in Europe" which they claim would give Scotland a seat at the top table among the other small nations. However, Scotland already has a seat at the top table, as part of the United Kingdom, with an influence that smaller countries can only dream about, having 10 votes instead of three in Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The members of the Scottish National party should reflect on Scotland's success in securing six times as much regional assistance from the Community as does Denmark, a country that they constantly pray in aid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sillars</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the Secretary of State aware of the reverse logic of what he is saying? The only reason that Scotland gets regional aid is that it is poorer than Denmark and that is because, unlike Denmark, Scotland has no Government who vote and influence the key Community decisions. The Secretary of State should be ashamed of himself when he says that Scotland gets bigger handouts than other countries. That shows the folly of the Government's policies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making a brave attempt to do down the great benefits that the Government have secured from the European Community under the existing arrangements. He seeks also to disguise the fact that the Scottish National party wants, not independence in Europe, but to walk out of Britain and to crawl on its kness as supplicants to Brussels. The hon. Gentleman's party has a policy that is driven by dependence on Europe. I regard that as a demeaning posture that would marginalise Scotland. Moreover, it is based on the insecure assumption that Europe would welcome an independent Scotland into the Community. That must be the subject of considerable doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that the creation of a tax-raising Assembly would have dire consequences for the Scottish economy. The Opposition are wrong to suggest that it would not. The opening bid of taxation at 2p in the pound would not begin to cover the expenditure programmes on which a tax-raising Assembly would embark. Even 2p in the pound would raise £325 million, about 3 per cent. of the total budget which, as Secretary of State for Scotland within a United Kingdom Government, I have at my disposal. Yet that would impose a burden of another £5 per week on a single man and about £4 a week on a married man. That is just the beginning of the measure of the burden that the Opposition would impose on the people of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alistair Darling (Edinburgh, Cental)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0207">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I must press on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That money would not begin to cover the extension of powers that the Opposition would seek to impose to control the Scottish economy, through major economic planning and guidance initiatives and a whole raft of other measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The onset of the European single market will make it essential for Scotland to have highly competitive rates of tax. Otherwise, business—including Scottish business—will take advantage of the internal market and leave Scotland. Higher taxes will deter inward investment, drive away wealth creators, cost thousands of jobs and affect the prosperity of every man, woman and child. Any attempt to ringfence Scotland along the lines suggested by the Labour party's convention, or to apply what is called "protection"—more dangerous to the Scottish economy than any Mafia protection—would simply ruin Scotland's economic progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no wonder that every survey of Scottish business has revealed strong opposition to tax-raising Assemblies. From the Institute of Directors, the Confederation of British Industry and the business pages of 	<i>Scotland on Sunday,</i> the message is clear, sometimes by a majority of 95 per cent. to 5 per cent.—a tax-raising Assembly would spell disaster for Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dick Douglas 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dunfermline, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State will be aware that in Germany the state of Bavaria has its own Parliament and the ability to assign taxes.

Labour's plans for a tax-raising Scottish assembly have nothing to do with democracy or with improving local government. Local government would be undermined, and its powers would be centralised. The notion that the Confederation of Scottish Local Authorities would vote for a Scottish Assembly is like expecting turkeys to vote for Christmas. Nor have Labour's plans anything to do with devolution. In a unitary state, power devolved can be retrieved, yet the Labour party's convention document calls for the entrenchment of powers so that they could not be amended unilaterally by Westminster. That is not devolution. It would be an irrevocable shift in the balance of our constitution—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State has answered a question that was not asked. The essential reason for the delay was that we requested that a debate on constitutional matters in Scotland took place in Edinburgh. We were told that the Secretary of State and his colleagues were willing to hold such a debate, but on no account in Edinburgh. If anyone wishes to challenge that, they may do so in another form, on another occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was not impressed by the Secretary of State's speech. I fear that it was supposed to be a fighting speech. The thud of gauntlets could be heard on every side. However, most of his audience was understandably seized with a desire to laugh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition believe that the future government of Scotland is important. However, we recognise that a meeting of minds between the Government and the Opposition on the issue is unlikely to occur. Ministers have shown a sad determination to defy Scottish opinion on that issue above all others. They argue the case for the status quo—a policy that attracts minimal support from the Scottish people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My duty today is to set out our case briefly and reasonably clearly. The Labour party believes that Scotland should have a Parliament that operates within the framework of the United Kingdom. It should be built into our constitutional arrangements. Our intention is to strengthen the union by ensuring that it is sufficiently flexible to meet Scotland's special needs. We seek reform within, not secession from, the United Kingdom. With respect, I say that there is no point in the nationalists' demand that our scheme, which was endorsed by the Scottish Constitutional Convention, should meet their tests. Our case would not and should not meet such demands. We do not make a case for separatism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our case is essentially democratic. We live in a centralised state where power is in the grip not of Parliament but of Whitehall and the Government machine. It is essential that power is transferred to the people to be exercised in the areas where they live. That is important not just for Scotland but for Wales, the north and other parts of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish experience is not now unique as perhaps it was in the 1970s, but is shared throughout the country. There is a different atmosphere from that in 1978 and 1979. Reform in one part of the country will spark movement in others. That movement will complement, even if it does not reproduce precisely, what Labour intends in Scotland. The atmosphere now is for change, but the Government are defying the mood of the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State claimed, as will others, that the scheme would be unworkable because Britain could not accommodate such a fundamental change. The opponents, especially the Conservatives, are hard at work encouraging echoes of the 1970s debates. That is wishful thinking; the work of politicians who use the fear of change to block progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State should remember that the recent research carried out by the Rowntree Trust found substantial support for Scottish devolution in England, by a majority of 2:1, and a clear majority—over 50 per cent of the voters—in favour of the Scottish Constitutional Convention scheme in Scotland, despite the multiplicity of choices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
The essence of the case for Labour is that unlike the Government, we trust the people to take their own decisions. We want democratic control over an existing Scottish Office that employs 8,000 civil servants. Devolution is not about introducing a new expensive and expansive bureaucracy. The budget of £11 billion and the administration of its services is already in place. Such radical reform would have practical and important consequences: that is the point of the exercise. The Scottish Parliament will have the power to make law. That is what matters in a democratic society. It will control all the major areas of domestic legislation: health, education and housing. The list is well known, well defined and widely accepted in Scotland. Its decisions will reflect Scottish views, traditions and needs, unlike those taken today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The past decade was riddled with mistakes, some of which were monumentally insensitive. Anyone who wanted to spend £1,000 million on buying bitterness and confusion could not have done better than to introduce the poll tax. The irrelevant education policy fragmented the school system and created stress rather than put in place the most effective support for the pupils' benefit. The challenge to the national health service is such that the NHS cannot reasonable be expected to survive another term of a Government who believe that health care is another commodity to be bought and sold in the marketplace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past 12 years, there has been an impressive sustained argument for change. It is a perverse tribute to the Government that, under their stewardship, public opinion has moved substantially and decisively in favour of devolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The core of the case is legislative power, but the Scottish Parliament will have a wider remit and influence. I referred to the budget of £11 billion with its consequent purchasing power. There will be substantial economic responsibilities—development agencies, training for skills and regional policy. The scheme is well-rounded, well-constructed and worthwhile. That comes as a great shock to the Secretary of State who was reported in the newspapers in the past couple of days as saying that Labour is planning a costly and dangerous constitutional upheaval, "a nightmare scenario" of a centrally planned economy that would destroy all the achievements of the past decade. I sympathise with the aim of wanting to end the achievements of the past decade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scotland is plunging into recession. Investment and productivity are falling and unemployment is rising. It is an eccentric definition of achievement but those dire warnings are based on the discovery that a Scottish Parliament will have power and defined and effective influence. For the vast majority of Scots, that is its essential justification. We are not prejudging how such power might be used, but if a Scottish Parliament had no power, the game would not be worth the candle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is odd to criticise such a Parliament for having worthwhile powers and responsibilities. The Secretary of State sees it as doubly dangerous because the power will be in the hands of politicians who reflect Scottish opinion. One of the saddest things about the Government's stance is that they will not trust the people and they consider that Scots exercising their franchise cannot be trusted to act responsibly. Ministers who persist in those attitudes will not be trusted by the people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0209">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
An enormously important point has to be considered—the Government's obsession with financial powers. We do not intend to undermine the union. I have made that clear. We want to remain in a partnership in which resources are pooled for the common good and allocated on the basis of need. The Government are obsessed with financial arrangements. The visit to Scotland by the Leader of the House is further evidence of their determination to misunderstand and misrepresent them. I say with no pleasure that he was reduced to recycling the third-rate material used a year ago by the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) when, as chairman of the Scottish Conservative Party, he reduced his party to a virtual state of civil war.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agreed script is that if Westminster passes power to a new Scottish Parliament, it will provoke a punitive expedition by the Treasury, leading to massive cuts in public expenditure allocation north of the border. Public expenditure will be allocated not on the basis of need but simply as a straight payment per head of the population. That case was put forward by the hon. Member for Stirling. It went out of fashion, but reappeared in the speech made by the Leader of the House the other day. He said that the cost to the Scots would be the equivalent of £640 per head, per year, and that if this is to be made up, it can be only be at the expense of what he was pleased to call an "English Backlash Tax". Scots, as he elegantly put it, will pay "a lot more on top".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This crude scaremongering is familiar from the bovver-boy tactics of the lunatic fringe of the No Turning Back Group. It is much more distressing when it comes from the Cabinet and the Leader of the House. Will the Secretary of State or perhaps the Under-Secretary tell us where the Government stand on the argument? Do Ministers believe that allocations should no longer be on the basis of need? Do not they recognise that Scotland's budget is based upon our housing problems, economic deprivation and poverty and areas of scattered rural population? Do the Government really intend to end the principle of equalisation? I ask those questions because when Ministers are pushed in public, they tend to say, "It will happen. It is inevitable", but refuse to say what their position is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Was the Leader of the House speaking for the Cabinet and for the Secretary of State for Scotland? If Scotland obtains a measure of devolution, would a Conservative Government, if subsequently elected, return to the centralised system? If there were a Scottish Parliament, would the Conservatives favour a reduction in identifiable public expenditure in Scotland to the United Kingdom average irrespective of the assessed needs of Scotland? I do not want to know whether one or two Conservative Back-Bench extremists would argue that case—I want to know whether the Conservative party would argue it. Will the right hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Lang) espouse that cause when he gets the chance? If the Secretary of State does favour it, would he apply the same rule to every other area of the United Kingdom that presently has a higher level of public expenditure than the average? If he believes that the axe should fall uniquely on Scottish expenditure, how does he justify such a punitive approach?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
To be fair to the Secretary of State, his views on this matter are always evolving. I am grateful to 	<i>The Scotsman</i> of 5 March for a quote from the Secretary of State's earlier career when he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the Parliament"—</p></blockquote>
that is the Scottish Parliament—
	<br><blockquote><p>"does not have tax raising powers, then it is in essence a bogus sham because it can do nothing other than talk; it might just as well gather together and be a debating society—there is nothing it can do."</p></blockquote>
In the original round of argument, the right hon. Gentleman, no doubt taking the official line, regarded the essence of a responsible democratic body as the ability to raise some of the revenue that it spends. Now, 10 years on, we are told that that very power is an insult, a danger undermining the stability of Scotland. We are threatened with a series of propositions from the Leader of the House, hinted at by the Secretary of State, which, if carried out, would destroy the basis on which the United Kingdom's partnership exists. That is the idea that we take our resources, whether from the North sea or personal taxation, pool them and allocate them according to need. If the Secretary of State is saying that a measure of devolution passed by Westminster in the interests of better government for the people of Scotland is a justification for destroying that idea, he should make it clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such scare stories reflect no credit on the Government. They are predictable and unconvincing. Many are no more than statements of prejudice. Ministers are convinced—the Secretary of State paid lip service to the idea in his fast gallop through his script—that devolution inevitably means economic disaster. As the hon. Member for Dunfermline, West (Mr. Douglas) said, "Go tell that to the Bavarians. Go tell it to the Catalonians. Tell it to most of the major and successful European economic forces." The Government may not listen to sense, but we do not have to talk nonsense. We shall continue to argue our case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are signs of desperation everywhere in the Government camp. The Conservative alliance with the Scottish National party—no doubt they will be relieved to hear me say it—is a grotesque mismatch, a marriage of convenience formed in the hope of killing off devolution, before the parties turn to killing off each other. There is no more unlikely and unpleasant spectacle than the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) telling the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Sillars) what a fine fellow he is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that. I said that I was on the opposite side of the political spectrum to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Sillars). He is a nationalist and a socialist, and I am a unionist and a believer in capitalism. Despite that, I paid tribute to his excellent technical speech destroying the propositions of the Scottish Constitutional Convention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That merely proves that the world is round and that if two people stand at the very extremes of the political range, one will meet the other at the back. The hon. Member for Eastwood is an unlikely bedfellow for the hon. Member for Govan. I regard it not as a conspiracy against the Labour party, but as a conspiracy against Scotland and Scottish opinion.

	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
I shall give Ministers a warning. I listen with care to what the Government say. I fear what they may say when they are in opposition. There is a real danger that they will box themselves in, that they will commit themselves to actions and attitudes that they will regret later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government know that the Labour party is committed to change. I know that the Secretary of State went through an unconvincing ritual when he said that Labour would not and could not deliver. I presume that he talks to few Labour Members, certainly in Scotland. However, if he did, and if he were aware of opinion in the Labour party, he would know that that is a tired old slander that carries no conviction. I assure him yet again that the Labour party will deliver. Every day, public opinion recognises that fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point of the hon. Member for Govan that what he said only this week was in reply to a question and that he was not making an ex cathedra statement that had been prepared in advance. Nevertheless, he was tacitly admitting that there was some point in discussing what kind of deal the nationalists would do with a Labour Government or a Labour party on the edge of power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a press conference yesterday, it was reported to me that the chair of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Association tacitly admitted that the Government's 100-seat majority would not be reproduced at the next election. He spoke of the need to win two or three more seats in Scotland because they might be decisive in the overall result. That is a mark of the extent to which Conservative confidence has been undermined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour will be in a position to deliver. I accept that when we introduce the measure, the Opposition—Conservative Members—will be entitled to put their points, and legitimate arguments can be advanced. Arguments against change can and no doubt will be put by the Conservative party, but those arguments will lose and a new relationship will be forged with the rest of the United Kingdom. When that happens, the Conservative Opposition will have a duty to co-operate and make that new deal work. It will not work if they box themselves in by encouraging and joining the cavemen. They will receive no thanks if they opt entirely out of the new arrangements and obstruct what we believe will potentially be the better government of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition have responsibilities as well as the Government, as we have had to learn painfully over recent years. I hope that the Secretary of State will bear that in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The constitutional convention has been a remarkable success story. We have never hidden the fact that we have had our frustrations and difficulties, and I am sure that I speak also for the Liberal Democrats and the other parties involved. However, the convention has worked and has created a remarkable measure of agreement. I am not impressed—neither, I suspect, are many people in Scotland—by the argument that is still being used by the Prime Minister that the convention is unrepresentative,
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
when the charge comes from those who have refused to participate. I think that the public wanted politicians to come out of the trenches and try to build a consensus. That is exactly what has happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will have a Parliament that will not be a pale shadow or imitation of what happens at Westminster. We are prepared to be flexible when considering some of the difficult and controversial tasks such as making the democratic voting system more representative and doing something about the palpable under-representation of women in the political system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The polls suggest that the Labour party's position is strong. There can be little doubt that the majority of Scots wish to see progress. The status quo commands a very low rating, significantly lower than the Tories' share of the vote, which is something of an achievement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is higher.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Here is a really technical argument. Are there more people in favour of the status quo than of the Conservative party, or vice versa? That is something that the hon. Member for Eastwood is interested in discussing, but as both totals are trailing at the bottom of the league table, I do not think that the rest of the country will want to spend much time on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman talked earlier about public support for these matters. He was wrong then, but I hesitated to correct him. He might like to know that the MORI poll, which has systematically pursued the issue over a period of time, quoted support for a Scottish Assembly as standing at 49 per cent in June 1989 and 33 per cent now. Support for the status quo was 15 per cent in June 1989 and 28 per cent now. In 1989, 20 per cent of individuals rated constitutional matters high on the agenda, while 12 per cent do so now. How does the hon. Gentleman square those figures with his arguments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can go on arguing about individual polls. Support for the status quo is by and large in the high teens. It has been below 20 per cent in a long run of polls. I have seen support for the constitutional convention as high as 51 per cent, but it is generally around the 45 or 46 per cent mark. I do not think that the Secretary of State can argue seriously about the overwhelming support that exists for our point of view and the case we have advanced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always believed that there is a case for a substantial, radical change in our system of government. Anyone who considers the past 10 years cannot deny that such a shake-up is necessary. I cannot elaborate on this at great length, but the European experience brings a new dimension to the argument. The European Community is changing and developing all the time. No longer are all the decisions taken by the council of Ministers or by national Governments. A whole raft of government is beginning to emerge: the German lander, the Spanish autonomous regions, the Italian provinces and some of the French departments. The tragedy will be if we miss out now on influencing and taking part in that. We shall lose valuable time. We shall sit and watch patterns being set and friendships evolving in Europe which will be to our advantage or disadvantage and which we ought to influence. I have no doubt about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we had a Scottish Parliament, operating within the framework of the United Kingdom, it would give us a real opportunity to key into these developments in a way that is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0211">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
solidly in the interests of the people of Scotland. I contrast that with the opinion of the Secretary of State and the Scottish National party. There is some justification here for their unlikely alliance; they both occasionally hark back to the days of the late Charles de Gaulle and the Luxembourg compromise and neither is prepared to move forward in the spirit of the times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State made something of a parade of his European record. We have a proposition: Scotland's Europa with a representative office in 'Brussels which is a shadow of the representation that many of the units of government I have described have already established. That very tentative step forward was defended by the Secretary of State internally in the Scottish Office, not as being right but as being a politically necessary way of dealing with a perceived political weakness. At the time he was opposed by the present Minister of State who saw the modest proposals as "uncontrollable" and saw
	<br><blockquote><p>"the danger of it being used as an exercise for unnecessary foreign junkets"—</p></blockquote>
which—
	<br><blockquote><p>"would be highjacked by other publicity seeking pressure groups."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. That is wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise. It was the Under-Secretary of State in the House of Lords. I have overlooked these nice matters of etiquette. The Under-Secretary in the House of Lords took these odd, eccentric views which provide an interesting insight. He is still in that position of authority as a Minister, despite the fact that he is utterly opposed to any development of a Scottish dimension in the European Community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What a load of pathetic rubbish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is extremely interesting that a Scottish Office Minister can say that our idea of representation in Brussels is fundamentally wrong, can describe it as a body that will be "uncontrollable", and sees
	<br><blockquote><p>"the danger of it being used as an exercise for unnecessary foreign junkets"—</p></blockquote>
which—
	<br><blockquote><p>"would be hijacked by other publicity seeking pressure groups."</p></blockquote>
If that is the spirit of the Scottish Office I am not surprised that the Secretary of State is looking embarrassed. When people say that something is nonsense and not worth raising, it usually means that it is well worth raising. We have hit a raw nerve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that I carry all my colleagues with me in saying that we need a new deal and a new relationship, not only with Europe but with the rest of the United Kingdom. It is sensible to build on Scotland's sense of identity, our different approach to law and religion, and our respect for and loyalty to Scottish traditions. That must be done, both because it is worth while in itself and, even more importantly, because that is the way in which we can most effectively contribute to Europe and to the growth and future prosperity of the United Kingdom. The Government do not have the vision or imagination to rise to the challenge. A Labour Government would have the

Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) should not worry about being blamed for throwing the odd word of praise towards me. I used to be his Member of Parliament. It is a superficial charge from Labour Members who have spent the past 12 years cheering every speech made by the right hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Mr. Heath). I hope that you, Mr. Martin, in your other role in the House, will not be upset by cross-party compliments. When we last discussed housing, I was so impressed by your speech that I felt bound to write into 	<i>Hansard</i> complimentary remarks on the way that you had conveyed the truth of the matter.

The hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) is missing from this debate. When the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said that he spoke for all his colleagues, I wondered whether that included the hon. Member for Linlithgow. I recall the period 1974–79. I have never heard praise from Tory Members for a Labour Member such as that which they gave the hon. Member for Linlithgow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My hon. Friends and I approach the matter with one basic question: what is best for the Scottish people within the development of the European Community? Certain choices are available. There are two Unionist choices. There is that offered by the Tory Government—the status quo. That is unacceptable because the Tory party has no political legitimacy in Scotland. The other Unionist solution is the convention package presented by the Labour party and its allies. To be fair to the hon. Member for Garscadden, the implication of his remarks is that the Labour party would give a limited range of powers to Scotland, within the parameters of United Kingdom policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third option is that suggested by the Scottish National party—member state status for Scotland in the European Community. That would be same status as that enjoyed by Ireland, Denmark and Luxembourg and that which will be enjoyed by Sweden, Austria or Norway who have applied, or are likely to apply, for membership. Independence within the European Community, which is the status of the United Kingdom and other member states, is the best option for the people of Scotland. It would give us direct representation in the Community's legislative forum—not the Commission or the Parliament, but the Council of Ministers. Almost as important, member state status would allow us to participate in COREPER—the

	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
committee of permanent representatives of each member state—which does the bulk of the work on reaching consensus before a meeting of the Council of Ministers. The late Stanley Budd was an expert on how the Community operated and he described the Council of Ministers as only the tip of the decision-making iceberg. That ambassadorial organisation, with its own committees, draws up the draft agenda and is the larger part of the decision-making iceberg.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir David Steel 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the scenario that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sillars</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting that people such as the right hon.

It is a level of argument way below that which one would normally expect from the right hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should have a direct influence on decision making, both in terms of the votes that we would cast in the Council of Ministers—they are not cast on Scotland's behalf at present—and in terms of the decision-making process. That is very important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The report of the Irish presidency of the European Community between January and June 1990 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Ireland's fourth Presidency of the European Community, covering the period January to June 1990, took place at a crucial time in the history of our continent. From the beginning it was clear that the advent of German unification and the pace and extent of the other changes in Central and Eastern Europe would give the Community a crucial role to play in providing an anchor of stability in a wider European framework and in securing Europe's future.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Among our main Presidency responsibilities were, therefore, not only to ensure that there was no slackening in the pace of Community integration, in particular through the completion of the Internal Market, Economic and Monetary Union and Political Union, but also to lead and co-ordinate the Community's response to the rapidly changing situation in Central and Eastern Europe.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The major themes of Ireland's EC Presidency were…German unification … Implementation of the Single European Act … Economic and Monetary Union … Political Union …</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>We would wish our Presidency performance to be judged by the progress achieved, and in the final analysis by the influence that decisions made in the last six months will have in the future. We have not just presided in a formal sense over the Community, we have helped to shape and influence developments, by concentrating on the priorities we feel to be important and identifying future goals that need to be accomplished."</p></blockquote>
Ireland has considerable influence because it participates in the Council of Ministers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. NORMAN HOGG 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I am sure that he recalls the Labour Government, when I had the privilege of representing in the Council of Ministers when we had the Presidency. I spent a lot of time in Brussels as an agricultural Minister. The reality is that Scotland within the United Kingdom delegation has more clout and influence in the Council of Ministers than Ireland, the
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
Netherlands or any other small country. That is the way it works, and it is not just because Scotland's interests often coincide with England's interests. If the hon. Gentleman is interested in advancing Scotland's interests within the Community, he should work at improving the democratic institutions of the Community and giving the Parliament more power. That would do more than does diverting the argument and introducing the red herring, which the hon. Gentleman is not prepared to admit it, of a whole set of independent states, as the right hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Sir D. Steel) pointed out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sillars</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a remarkable proposition. The hon. Gentleman has told us that Scotland, which he will admit has no influence on the British Cabinet whatever—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Yes, the Opposition have been ignored. we pass motion after motion, such as those on fisheries, but we cannot ensure that the Cabinet carries such policy to the European Community. The moment that a different political decision is made in the ballot box south of the border, Scotland is locked out of influence in the European Community. There is not substitute for real power. Neither the Tory Government nor the convention package will give the Scottish people real power in the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The convention package does not represent real choice. It consigns Scotland not to an international role, but to a regionalist, provincialist role inside the Community and keeps Scotland subservient to Westminster. Above all, its defect lies in its exercise of the self-delusion of its authors. It is a fraudulent document; the reality is different from the appearance that it purports to give.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I disagree with the Secretary of State who said that the Scottish Constitutional Convention's claim of entrenchment would do nothing to upset the British constitution. I am indebted to 	<i>The Scotsman</i> for printing the document in its entirety. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The convention endorses the principle of entrenchment in relation to Scotland's parliament. … it would be incapable of being unilaterally amended at a later date by the Westminster parliament."</p></blockquote>
That surely represents a considerable change in the British constitution, never mind Scotland's relations with the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I read the newspaper published by the convention to popularise and inform the public of the convention package. It is called 	<i>Scotland's Voice</i> and in it I found a proper explanation:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Convention is adamant that the powers of the Scottish Parliament once established must be entrenched so that they cannot be altered without the consent of the Parliament representing the people of Scotland. The convention recognised that it would always be constitutionally possible for Westminster to repeal or amend the Act of Parliament which created the Scottish Parliament but explained that it was the Convention's aim to make such a move practically and politically impossible."</p></blockquote>
I hung on the next words because surely an F-shaped idea was about to come forward.
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Report explained that this would be achieved by including in the Act establishing the Scottish Parliament a clause stating that 'the powers would not be altered without the consent of the Scottish Parliament'."</p></blockquote>
That does nothing to alter the British constitution. Even if such a provision were in a Scottish Parliament Bill, under the British constitution, which is not challenged by the Labour Party, this parliament is sovereign, so it does not matter what is in such an Act. No Parliament can bind its

	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
successor, and a successor Parliament could demolish the Scottish Parliament. Constitutionally, that would be no bother whatever.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sillars</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Gough Whitlam's Government were sacked through the exercise of Crown powers which the Labour party in Britain does not want to scrap. The hon. Gentleman has not made a good point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fiscal policy is to remain at Westminster. The convention document mentions that "assigned revenues" will come to the Scottish Parliament, but it does not tell us that the rates and levels of those assigned revenues will be fixed by the Westminster Parliament. The document goes on to say that Scotland's Parliament should have power to vary the rate of income tax. Who will decide that variation? Will it be included in the principal Act setting up the Scottish Parliament, therefore a decision made by the Westminster Parliament, or will there be a self-imposed cap by the Scottish Parliament? If it is to be a self-imposed cap by the Scottish Parliament, as that Parliament cannot bind its successors, they will have an unlimited ability to increase income tax beyond the rate set by the Westminster Parliament. We are entitled to know which one it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The following extract deals with industrial power. It speaks of
	<br><blockquote><p>"Powers to co-ordinate the planning of the Scottish components of UK industries where there is a clear interrelation or where scale demands UK planning."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to mention the financial sector, oil and gas, petrochemicals and power. I was puzzled by that. I could not understand it, so I read the newspaper again for more information. There I found Campbell Christie, member of the convention and general secretary of the Scottish Trades Union Congress, telling thick me what that passage meant:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On the North Sea, the Scottish Parliament would have a key role, with a veto, in determining UK policy for offshore development."</p></blockquote>
That contradicts what the hon. Member for Garscadden said a few minutes ago, when he talked about bringing all the resources from the diverse parts of the United Kingdom into a common pool for common allocation. Does that mean that Scotland will have the power to exercise a veto over all development? I hope so, but it is a legitimate question that has not been answered, and the terrible contradiction between what Campbell claims and what the hon. Gentleman said earlier remains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Campbell Christie also mentions financial services. That is the largest sectoral employer in the Scottish economy, employing over 180,000 people. It is absolutely fundamental to our economic health. Who will legislate in respect of Scottish financial services? Will it be the Scottish Parliament, sitting in Edinburgh under a devolved scheme, or the Westminster Parliament? Those are legitimate questions that must be answered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman explain how the Scottish financial sector will operate, given that, according to him, any independent Scotland would reserve the right not to support a single European currency, but would retain its currency, even if all other members of the Community agreed to unify currencies? Does not his scenario require a Scottish veto on European decisions, which the European Community will not grant?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sillars</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman is so badly informed. We accept the logic that the single market will lead to a single European currency. The hon. Gentleman is 100 per cent. wrong.

I now turn to the proposals from the Scottish Constitutional Convention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sillars</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at the moment.

Let us examine the proposals for social security administration. I am again indebted to 	<i>Scotland's Voice</i> for the following weasel words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There are few communities in Scotland that have not known the distress and bitterness that comes with unemployment. There is little dignity in the dole queue. Therefore"—	<i>[Interruption.]</i>—</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I cannot hear what the hon. Gentleman is saying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sillars</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Labour Members do not want to hear. The newspaper continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Therefore, although social security policy would remain with the United Kingdom, its administration would be in Scottish hands."</p></blockquote>
So what? If the United Kingdom Government decided to alter the social security system to the disadvantage of ordinary people, that policy would be administered by the Scottish Parliament, irrespective of who controlled it. The preamble to the above statement gives the impression that we are being offered an instrument to correct social injustice, but by the end it is clear that it is an instrument for implementing social injustice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The newspaper also states that agriculture, fisheries and forestry
	<br><blockquote><p>"are all vital in Scotland, not only in its economy, but also because they represent many lively communities and distinctive ways of life. Their healthy functioning will be a responsibility of the Scottish Parliament."</p></blockquote>
I returned to Campbell Christie, because I was not sure what "healthy functioning" meant. It could mean spreading manure on fields, feeding fish or talking to trees. Campbell Christie introduces a European dimension on to a Scottish Parliament:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On fishing, it would have direct responsibility for the industry, including negotiations in Brussels."</p></blockquote>
That is important. The establishment of a Scottish Parliament with the ability to negotiate directly on Scottish fisheries at the Council of Ministers, would require a change in the treaties that set up the European Community. If Scottish negotiations are to take place in the Council of Ministers, what will happen to the interests of English fishermen? Will there be separate negotiations? How will the 10 votes be divided—three north of the border and seven south of the border? We require an explanation—but there is none.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal about the European Parliament is one of the most fraudulent in the document. If the European Community is made up of member states, the only people who can act inside the Council of Ministers are member states' governmental representatives. If the Opposition intend to remedy that by establishing some sort of regional organisation, they should check the voting records of Labour Members of the European Parliament in November and December. When it was proposed that regional authorities should be represented at the Council of Ministers—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now tackle the question that worries oor Tam, the missing Member of the Labour party. It is the west Lothian question. "A Claim of Right for Scotland", which was published in July 1988 and attempted to deal with the west Lothian question, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The United Kingdom is a political artefact put together at English insistence. If it is to continue, it must work for its living and justify its existence. It is for the English to decide how to govern themselves, but they must allow the continuing improvement of Scottish government. If they dislike the Parliamentary anomaly created by a Scottish Assembly, the remedy is in their own hands—a federal system."</p></blockquote>
That is not to say that the English can govern themselves as they like; it is to say how they should govern themselves. If the English people do not want a federal legislative system, the west Lothian question will remain unanswered. That is a reason for the vacuum in the excellent reproduction in 	<i>The Scotsman.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem that the Scottish people face is whether to opt for the continuation of the present system through the ballot box in an election that is fought on separate manifestos. The Tory party issues a separate manifesto for Scotland, as do the Liberal Democrats, the Labour party and the Scottish National party. There is a separate, clearly identifiable test of Scottish opinion. If Scottish people vote differently from folk south of the border, we get the Government that they have voted for. That is unacceptable and not favourable for the Scottish people. If they take the road of the convention, they will seriously limit their ability to guide their destiny and to contribute fully to the European Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why we say clearly to the Scottish people that the choice before them is simple: continue with either of the Unionist solutions and be second-class Englishmen or come with us and be first-class Scottish Europeans.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
who served in the constitutional convention do not accept that proposition; we worked hard to produce a scheme that would be workable and attainable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State was greeted by cries of, "Who wrote this?" during his speech. I think that the sad truth is that he wrote it himself. He must have imagined that he was back in his Cambridge Footlights days; it was that sort of speech. It did not address any of the serious arguments in favour of a Scottish Parliament. The Government have always said that the constitutional convention was unrepresentative—yet it contained representatives of the vast majority of local authorities throughout Scotland, and 58 of the 72 elected Members of Parliament from Scotland, leaving the door open to the others. I find the charge that it was unrepresentative difficult to take from a Government who manage to get only 10 out of the 72 Members of Parliament elected from the Scottish constituencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State for Scotland in no longer seen as Scotland's man in the Government. He is seen as the Government's man in Scotland, and that is very different. The convention addressed itself to setting up a scheme for Scotland. The Secretary of State went wider than that and argued about issues that we did not discuss—the role of the Secretary of State for Scotland and the number of Scottish Members at Westminster, which are matters for the Westminster Parliament to determine, in the fullness of time. I have news for the Secretary of State. I do not believe that there would be riots in the streets of Edinburgh, or anywhere else, if it were decided to abolish the post of Secretary of State for Scotland, with the advent of a Scottish Parliament. In my personal opinion, that seems a logical conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I charge the Government with a total and clear breach of faith with the Scottish people. Let us look back at what the Conservative party said and did on the subject. I do not know where the right hon. Gentleman was during the great conference in Perth in 1968, from which we had the so-called declaration of Perth, but at it we were told:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Conservative Party is determined to give the people of Scotland genuine participation in the making of decisions … we propose the creation of an elected Scottish Assembly."</p></blockquote>
In the referendum debate of 1979, a crucial intervention was made by Sir Alec Douglas-Home, with all the authority of a former leader of the Conservative party and a former Prime Minister. He argued that one of the defects of the devolution package on offer was that it did not include proportional representation or give tax-raising powers to the then proposed Scottish Parliament. In advising Conservatives to vote no in the referendum, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I should hesitate to vote no if I did not think that the parties will keep the devolution issue at the top of their priorities."</p></blockquote>
On that basis, people were conned into voting no in the referendum. The Conservative party has not kept devolution at the top of its priorities. In the meantime, those of us who worked in the Scottish Constitutional Convention have produced a scheme that puts right two defects in the 1979 proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind), speaking from the Opposition Benches in 1976, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Scotland is the only territory on the face of the earth which has a legal system without a legislature to improve, modernise and amend it."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 16 December 1976; Vol. 922; c. 1332.]</p></blockquote>
He was stating a fact, not an opinion. That fact does not change merely because he is now a member of the Cabinet. That truth remains a truth.

The case for the Convention's proposals rests partly on an argument that does not appear in our document—the inadequacy of the present system for legislating and controlling Scottish affairs in the Palace of Westminster. Around midnight last night, the hon. Minister for Dumfries (Sir H. Munro) complained that it was no hour to be debating such a crucial issue as the Scottish Natural Heritage Bill. Conservative Ministers say that anomalies might be produced in the Westminster arrangements if the convention proposal were implemented. It contains no anomalies as great as those in the present method of controlling Scottish Office matters and legislating on Scottish affairs in Wesminster.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, having made three interventions, I may be forfeiting my chance to speak in the bebate, but the right honourable Gentleman made an important point. Parliament should not be proud of what happened last night. It could not happen in a Scottish Parliament. An unelected Chamber, using the Government's majority, imposed a change in a Bill that is unacceptable to most Scottish Ministers of Parliament and to the Scottish people. That change was made and we did not have an opportunity thereafter to vote against the Bill on a Third Reading. The decision had already been taken. I put it to you, Mr Hogg, that whatever else we do, we should create a legislature that does not allow such things to happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir David Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not disagree with the hon. Gentleman, but his point is slightly different from mine. My complaint is that issues of such importance, for example, the great fishing debate, are regularly discussed at the fag end of the parliamentary day. The fishermen who came down from Scotland were appalled at the standard of the parliamentary performance late at night. It happens regularly with secondary legislation: in the teaching debate, for example, parents and teachers who came to listen were shocked at Scottish legislation being debated so late at night. The truth is that the only time when one would find a majority in the House of Commons for a Scottish Parliament is at half-past two in the morning, before the English majority is corralled here to vote on Scottish legislation. That is nonsensical and the people of Scotland know it. It is a far greater anomaly than anything in the Convention's proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. MICHAEL J. MARTIN 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>It is not just legislation that is affected. Let us take the convention of Question Time. Earlier the Secretary of State laid great stress on the fact that over the years administration had increasingly devolved to the Scottish Office. What about the accountability of that administration to the elected representatives of the people? English Members can table a question relating to their constituents on a farming matter on a Monday, a housing matter on a Tuesday, an education matter on a Wednesday and a health matter on a Thursday. Scottish Members cannot do that because the one Minister responsible is the Secretary of State for Scotland. We have to wait for our one chance a month when he comes to the Dispatch Box and we put our name in the raffle and hope for one of the 15 prizes. The accountability of Government to the elected representatives of the people is infinitely less for Scottish Members than it is for English and Welsh Members.</p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
	<p>I give credit to the Government, especially to Norman St. John Stevas who was then Leader of the House, for setting up the Select Committee system, an effective system of scrutinising the Government. There are Select Committees for every Department of State except one—the Scottish Office. The all-party Select Committee on Procedure, which is not a part of the Scottish Constitutional Convention or party-political, reported last Session:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The inability of the House to agree upon the membership of a Select Committee which its own Standing Orders state 'shall be appointed' is regrettable. Moreover, the absence of a Scottish Affairs Committee leaves a major Government Department unscrutinised and thus constitutes a deficiency (some would consider a serious deficiency) in the departmentally-related Committee system."</p></blockquote>
It is clear that the whole panoply of Scottish democratic procedure through Westminster is not working. It is time that the Government dealt with the arguments in favour of a convention. The lack of democratic accountability is beyond a joke. It is a national scandal.</p>
	<p>The Secretary of State's speech was a series of feeble jokes. If he took the trouble to go to Bavaria, or to Munich and Hamburg—great cities of economic and political power in Germany where there is effective decentralisation—he would understand my point. But perhaps he should go not to Germany—he would say that we did not have a federal system—but to the Government and Parliament of Catalonia, as I did. There is not an equal distribution of powers to the regions in Spain, therefore, a much closer analogy can be drawn to our argument on Scotland. In Catalonia, I asked whether in 1977 when a democratic Parliament was set up after the fall of Franco business men raised scares. The answer was "Oh yes, but they've disappeared now." I asked about the abuse of tax-raising powers. The answer was that those powers had not been abused. If a Scottish Parliament abused its tax-raising powers, it wouild get its comeuppance from the Scottish people. The Secretary of State used to use that argument in favour of the poll tax, but he does not recognise that it applies here. The Catalonians have established an effective Government office in Brussels while we are fiddling around with some fancy Scottish Europa.</p>
	<p>It is time that the Government looked again at the basic principles set out in the claim of right. I declare an interest as my wife was a member of the committee that drew it up, but it is good despite that. Paragraph 2.6 says that the matters on which the treaty of Union
	<br><blockquote><p>"guaranteed the Scots their own institutions and policies represented the bulk of civil life and government at the time; the Church, the Law and Education. However, there was never any mechanism for enforcing respect for the terms of the Treaty of Union. Many of its major provisions have been violated, and its spirit has never affected the huge areas of government which have evolved since"—</p></blockquote>
that is the Secretary of State's argument. Paragraph 2.6 continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The say of Scotland in its own government has diminished, is diminishing and ought to be increased."</p></blockquote>

The convention's proposals for a tax-raising Assembly or Parliament can best be described as follows: The Government know, as does everyone else, whether for or against these proposals or in favour of much more extensive proposals, that the moment powers to raise taxation are offered and taken by one of the devolved Assemblies, the fracture of the United Kingdom will have begun—not through the spontaneous activity of that part of the kingdom where there has been devolution, but because of the reaction which that act must provoke among people whose contributions in the form of taxation will continue to subsidise the livelihood and standard of living of the people in the devolved area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if there are sources of revenue available to the Scottish people for a limited period—the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Sillars) referred to oil as being the source of such revenue—they will be exhausted in one third of the life time of the average male citizen of the United
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
Kingdom, and that is not a sufficient basis on which to build a perpetual and irremovable constitutional change. Which is the most fractious—the block grant, or a self-financing power, topped up, as would invariably be the case, by smaller block grant made available through Parliament?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Supporters of a tax-raising Assembly will not imagine that there will be a situation, especially if the degree of unitary State that the Government advocate is maintained, in which the Scottish people will have access to major new sources of revenue to finance their needs. They will be in a permanent state of public expenditure deficit. I hope that in Scotland it will be a great deal smaller than it is at present—not because the needs of the people will diminish, but because their ability, through advancing prosperity, to pay for their needs will increase. Because there will be this continual deficit, there will be a temptation—indeed there will be a justification—for the English taxpayer to say that those who have the power to tax themselves and whose power approximates to self-government should damn well get on with doing it themselves. This will be especially so if economic circumstances or political pressures are such as to make the English interest or English regional interests supercede that of the general United Kingdom interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall be introducing into all political considerations an argument that has barely figured at all in British political dialogues and discussions. There has barely been a vote to be gained in this country, except among the nationalist paranoiacs, throughout the time that we have had the modern pluralistic, parliamentary, elected democracy, on the basis of where a candidate comes from or the immediate interests he is trying to serve. We have had divisions on a class basis, but not on a geographic or nationalistic basis. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Yes, I am reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The British people are firmly educated in and accept the idea of there being universal need met by universally collected resources, universally distributed on the basis of need, subject to appeal and representation in this House and the other organs which this House has set up. If that is changed, the fracture threatens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may illustrate in a practical way without the grandiose references to constitutions, the total integration of our economy and the interdependence of our people which make the idea of a seperate tax-raising system in Scotland a nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people of Scotland benefit from the rates that the people of Wales pay. When the people of Wales go to Scotland, they benefit from the rates that the Scots pay. We do not pay them specifically to benefit people in the rest of the United Kingdom, but involuntarily we make a general contribution to the public good for all citizens should they need to visit or to stay on a permanent basis in an economy which has been built by the people of that area… That is what makes it different from federal and certainly from seperate States. It is different to the extent of the economic geography of this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

For example, there could be 10 motorways in Scotland, but not one would be any good if there were not another motorway running up from the South Coast of England to meet them. They would be roads from nowhere.—[	<i>Laughter.</i>] It would take a long time for the Scottish

economy to justify itself on the basis of its internal communications. It needs integration with the remainder of the United Kingdom. It needs the motorways network and the telecommunications and railway links as a bond. I am glad that the Opposition found that speech interesting, fascinating and amusing, because it was made by the present Leader of the Opposition on 10th January 1978 and is reported in the 	<i>Official Report</i> at columns 1537 to 1545.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If so, are not the arguments advanced yesterday by the Chancellor of the Exchequer for retaining the United Kingdom's sovereignty for tax-raising purposes considerably weakened when they are applied in the context of the development of a European Community in which there is mobility of labour?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not be tempted to argue with the Liberal Democrats.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The convention's proposals are flawed and fraudulent. They do not tackle the questions of the Goschen-Barnett formula or of the number of Scottish Members of Parliament to be present at Westminster. Nor do they deal with the west Lothian problem, as described so admirably at our previous sitting by Tam. Until we deal with those matters, I agree with the Leader of the Opposition's remark that we should find
	<br><blockquote><p>"guaranteed disharmony, disunity, conflict and competition throughout the whole of Britain… The dominant issue of politics will be the jealousies of region against region, nation against nation, argument against argument. That will be … very bad news for Britain."</p></blockquote>
That is as valid today as it was when the leader of the Opposition said it at Blackpool on 26 April 1976.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Questions about the role of the Secretary of State and about the electoral system have not been tackled. We must tell the Scottish people that we understand their desire to improve the governance of Scotland and of the United Kingdom, but any proposals must be examined in detail. The details will show that the convention's proposals are flawed and fraudulent. They would never be approved by the House because they do not deal with those fundamental questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker). Being the kind and considerate person that I am, I worry about the jobs that Tory Members will get when they lose their seats at the general election.

Member for Tayside, North will be employed down at Westminster station shouting "Mind the gap" in his Blairgowrie accent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can console the hon. Gentleman by telling him that the hon. Member for Tayside, North had uttered only three words of his speech when I turned to my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) and said, "We're about to get the quotes from the Leader of the Opposition." I recognised those quotes instantly because I hear them repeated so often by Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State's performance today was one of the most appalling that I have ever seen from a senior Minster is this or any other Committee. It is one thing for a Minister to fail his office—that has happened in all Governments—but it is another for a Minister to go below the personal standards that he has set for himself. That is what he has rather tragically done today. He did not let the people of Scotland down because they do not expect anything else from him. Unfortunately, he let himself down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now that the Secretary of State has had time to think, I am sure that he wishes that he made the speech that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Goven (Mr. Sillars) made. That was a far better Conservative speech than that from the Secretary of State. I have watched the hon. Member for Govan through all his changes in political thinking and parties. It always interests me that he holds his new views with as much conviction and sincerity as he held his old views. I am the first to admit that I do not have that ability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can understand why the hon. Member for Govan attacks the convention with such viciousness. If the convention proposals succeed, the Scottish National party is finished. The hon. Gentleman was fighting for his political life this morning. However, the convention is not all bad news for the SNP. As co-chairman with the right hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Sir D. Steel) I should pay tribute to the hon. Member for Dunfermline, West (Mr. Douglas), who attended many of our meeetings and had some input into the document that was so ruthlessly torn apart.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 30 November 1990, when the document was presented to the people of Scotland, it was interesting to see the wide range of representation present. Every consulate in Scotland was represented. It was noticeable that the only major absentee was a representative from the Government. Conservative Members in Scotland seem to take the view that they can stand in the way of change in Scotland. Well I have news for them: they cannot. I will concede this to the SNP. The argument about Scotland's independence in Europe has to be resolved but the SNP will have to come clean and be honest with the people of Scotland and admit the point made by the right hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Perhaps that ship's horn is trying to tell me something. As Magnus Magnusson would say, "I've started, so I'll finish."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish National party must be honest with the people of Scotland. It must admit that before one can be independent in Europe, one has to be independent in the United Kingdom. The hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) nods her head in agreement; the hon. Member for Govan refused to answer that question earlier. Jim Fairley left the SNP because the hon. Gentleman said that an independent Scotland within the context of the United Kingdom was no longer relevant. However, that is a prerequisite for independence in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am intrigued by the argument. What does the Labour slogan "Independence in Britain" mean?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dunfermline, West—a Labour-held constituency—is going through the learning process in the SNP. The Labour party's policy on a Scottish Parliament was explained adequately when my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) raised the standard of debate following the Secretary of State's opening speech. I do not know whether the hon. Member for Dunfermline, West was present at that time, but to prevent me from giving an explanation that everyone else has heard already, I advise him to read the 	<i>Hansard</i> report of the Committee proceedings. He should tuck that report safely in his inside pocket because he will need it in Garscadden—the votes will be the most expensive that any candidate has ever gathered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Scotland has learnt anything in the past 12 years, it is that solutions to problems in Scotland must be found in Scotland and administered in Scotland. We have tried for far too long to find solutions to Scottish problems from outside Scotland, to the tragic cost of the people of Scotland. I listened to the offensive remarks of the Leader of the House when he was interviewed by Fiona Ross of Scottish Television in Edinburgh, Central—imagine choosing a constituency from which the Tories were swept away at the previous general election as the place to make such remarks. He said that the Tories won the election, to which Fiona Ross replied, "Not in Scotland you didn't." The Leader of the House then said, "Ah, but the people of Scotland were lucky that the Tories got sufficient seats in England and Wales to save the Scots from their own stupidity." If that is the attitude of the Tory party in Scotland, it will be wiped out at the next election, and deservedly so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a feeling among Tories that Scotland has nothing to offer and that it accepts all additional resources given to it, although, as my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden pointed out, resources are given on the basis of need. Scotland is an international centre for medical education, science and research. Its financial services sector is strong, yet the Tories talk as though Scotland has nothing to offer. The quicker that they realise that Scotland has much to offer and stop talking down the people of Scotland—[hon. Members: "Hear, hear!]—and give them credit for their ability to administer their affairs, the quicker we shall have a rational argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether the Conservative party in Scotland or the United Kingdom likes it, devolution will come. I return now to the case of the SNP, which must be answered. As Europe assumes more power, it will devolve power as the market becomes more open and nothing that the Conservatives can do will be able to stop that. They will be left in the wake of the devolution of power that will come from Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Politicians of all parties in Scotland should manage the change and accept the proposition for a Scottish Parliament. New groupings of nations will emerge as Europe develops. Scotland will have more in common with Norway, in terms of the North sea oil industry, than with the south of England. We will have more in common with Ireland, in terms of agriculture, than with some parts of the United Kingdom. The channel tunnel will change the relationship between the south of England and Scotland.
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
All those problems will have to be tackled politically as well as economically. The way to do that is to create a Scottish Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This had better not be a dialogue with the deaf. In his reply, the Under-Secretary will give his usual rip-roaring defence of the Government's position, but I hope that in their quieter moments, Conservative Members will think carefully about what they are doing, because they are doing more harm to the people of Scotland and Scotland as a country than they imagine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon McMaster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will be brief because of the limitations of time. It is ironic that this debate about the type of government that the Scottish people want was opened, and will be closed, by someone representing the type of government that the Scottish people do not want. The most that any Tory Member can claim today is that he spoke for the 20 per cent. of people—that may be a generous estimate—who support the Tories. No one wishes to deny those Conservative Members their perfectly legitimate right to represent that minority. However, they should be able to do so in a Scottish Parliament, so that the 10 of them can represent 20 per cent. of the people, while the 62 of us can represent the remaining 80 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also ironic that the nearest we have to a Scottish Parliament is the Scottish Grand Committee which, as has been said, is meeting in London today. It is the nearest thing that we have to a Scottish Parliament in that Scotland's 72 democratically elected Members of Parliament meet in a forum to discuss matters pertinent to Scotland. Although the overwhelming desire of the hon. Members in this forum is for a Scottish Parliament, that will not result from today's debate. That is where the problems arise. A Scottish Parliament is also overwhelmingly desired by the Scottish people, yet it is denied them by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was intrigued last week by the remarks of the Secretary of State for Scotland on local government. The right hon. Gentleman said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"this is a genuine consultation exercise".</p></blockquote>
That would be a novelty. The right hon. Gentleman gave the game away later by saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I certainly seek a consensus—a consensus behind the proposals that I am offering".—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 17 June 1991; Vol. 193, c.34–39.]</p></blockquote>
In other words, he was saying that democracy is a good thing only if people happen to agree with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to dispose of the red herring of the tax-raising powers of the Scottish Parliament proposed by the convention. That is not what the power would be; it would be a tax-varying power. [	<i>Laughter.</i>] That means that the tax can be raised or lowered. Conservative Members laugh; is that because they have so much faith in democracy that they know that they would never be elected to the Scottish Parliament? Why do they not argue the case? It would be logical for them to argue that they would stand for a Scottish Parliament and reduce taxes because that power would be enshrined within it. So the red herring about tax raising should not be mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the debate, hon. Members referred to democratic centralism and the centralist approach. It was a cheek for the Secretary of State to use language like that because there has never been a more centralist Government. Conservative Governments of the past decade have drawn
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0219">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
more power to the centre and have tried to dismantle local democracy in every way they could. I have made the case against democratic centralism in many political arguments, but it is infinitely preferable to the undemocratic centralism that we have had in the past decade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Scottish people are to have a real say in the government of the country, we have to shift power to them and share power with them. I commend the Scottish Constitutional Convention's efforts in producing a carefully thought-out package, with broad-based support. The Scottish Parliament will be established, because the Scottish people have power on election day and they will use that power to sweep away the Government, not only in Scotland, but throughout the rest of the country. I wonder whether the Conservative party and the Scottish National party, which have disagreed with a Scottish Parliament so much, will, when it is set up, stand by their principles or stand for election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dennis Canavan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting and long over-due debate, given that, on St. Andrew's day last year, the Scottish Constitutional Convention launched its proposals for a Scottish Parliament. I can understand the Government's reluctance to have this debate in Scotland. They chickened out of having the debate in front of a Scottish audience, because, even in front of a Westminster audience, they have demonstrably failed to substantiate or defend their case. In front of s Scottish audience, the Government would have been completely discredited, and deservedly so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The governance of Scotland in recent years has been a national scandal and disgrace. The people of Scotland have been ruled by a party that was rejected by more than three quarters of the people of Scotland. The Conservative party's representation from Scotland in this place has been reduced to a miserable rump of 10 Members of Parliament. Yet, because of the over-centralised nature of the British state, that party has used—or rather abused—its power to foist on the people of Scotland policies and legislation that they did not want and against which the majority of Scotland's elected representatives voted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservative party has inflicted disastrous policies on the people of Scotland, which have had a detrimental effect on housing standards, educational standards and on the standards of patient care in the national health service. The economic policies foisted upon us have thrown many of our people out of work. The people of Scotland have also been used as guinea pigs—for example, with the universally detested poll tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government defend the British unitary parliamentary system, but they are defending the indefensible. Any objective observer of the parliamentary scene would be forced to the conclusion that parliamentary scrutiny of Scottish legislation is grossly inadequate. At times, it makes a farce of our so-called parliamentary democracry. Some hon. Members mentioned the events of last night—or rather after 2 am—when a debate on a very important aspect of a Scottish Bill was terminated. My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) might have been tempted to coin a new west Lothian question: in an important debate on a Scottish Bill, when the majority of Scottish elected repesentatives in the House of Commons do not want it, how is it that an amendment
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
inserted by an undemocratic House of Lords be agreed to? That is no way to run a 20th century parliamentary democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In recent years, we have had even less opportunity to make the Government accountable to the elected House of Commons. There has been a steady abuse of Government power to erode that accountability, especially on Scottish matters. The Government have refused to set up a Select Committee on Scottish Affairs. English Tory Members have been drafted on to Scottish Standing Committees. There has been a regular invasion of Scottish Question time by English Tory Members, to the extent that many of us are deprived of the opportunity to speak on behalf of our constituents at Question Time. To add insult to injury, there is the widespread use—or rather abuse—of ministerial powers of patronage. The Government have shown blatant political prejudice in appointments to unelected positions in many important areas of Scottish life. Sometimes, I wonder whether the only Tories left in Scotland are to be found on health boards, quangos and other organisations over which the Secretary of State and his colleagues have power of patronage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part of the reason for the deplorable lack of democracy in the governance of Scotland is that it is the only nation in the world with its own Department of State, its own legal system, and laws, but without a legislature to pass those laws. That was one of the basic problems considered by the Scottish Constitutional Convention when it began its work way back in March 1989. The claim of right signed by all members of the convention states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We do hereby acknowledge the sovereign right of the Scottish people to determine the form of Government best suited to their needs."</p></blockquote>
I should have thought that such a basic principle, enshrining the sovereignty of the people, would appeal to anyone who believes in the fundamental principles of democracy. It does not appeal to this Government, because they apparently do not believe in democracy. Instead, they have tried to rubbish the Scottish Constitutional Convention right from the outset, by heaping personal abuse on many of its members and claiming that the convention is not truly representative of the people of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have the brass neck to claim that the convention is not truly representative of the people of Scotland, when it is more representative of the people of Scotland than they are. It is worth pointing out that 80 per cent of Scottish parliamentary representatives are members of the convention; it also includes representatives from local government, from the churches, trade unions and, despite what the Secretary of State said earlier, business life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The convention would be even more representative if the Tories and the Scottish National party had not boycotted it. I regret their decision not to participate in the work of the convention and I am sure that they will live to regret it. Some members of the Conservative party and the Scottish National party have made important contributions to the work of the convention and support the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The convention's proposals for a Scottish Parliament with legislative and economic powers were launched on St. Andrew's day last year. If those proposals have achieved nothing else they have put Scottish constitutional issues at the top of the political agenda, where they deserve to be. Not long ago, Scottish Office Ministers claimed that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0220">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
people of Scotland were not really interested in a Scottish Assembly or a Scottish Parliament and that constitutional matters were non-issues. They have changed their tune—an new attitude prevails, especially in the Scottish Office. The Government have realised that the challenge of the Scottish Constitutional Convention can no longer be ignored. Speech writers and word processors churn out anti-convention propaganda from Tory party headquarters and St. Andrew's house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday, the Secretary of State described the Labour party's proposals for a Scottish Parliament as the biggest takeover bid in Scottish history. He is right in a way. The convention proposes a massive transfer of power from an undemocratic, bureaucratic, non-accountable Government to the people of Scotland, who have the right to determine their own destiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to question or, perhaps, challenge the Government. If they are so confident about their position and the status quo of unionism, as opposed to the proposals of the Scottish Constitutional Convention, and if they believe in their new slogan, "Choices for the People" launched yesterday, why are they afraid to give the people of Scotland a real choice? Why are they afraid to put the question to the Scottish people in a referendum? People would then be able to choose between the status quo and the proposals of the Scottish Constitutional Convention. I know why the Government will not hold a referendum. They are running scared, but they cannot run forever. If the people of Scotland are denied a referendum, they will seize the next available opportunity. That will almost certainly be the next general election, which, especially in Scotland, will go down in history as the home rule election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people of Scotland will be given the choice between the status quo, offered by the Government, and what is offered by the Labour party—immediate implementation of the constitutional convention's radical proposals to set up a Scottish Parliament with legislative and economic powers and the power to repair much of the damage that the Government have inflicted on the people of Scotland. A Scottish Parliament would make the government of Scotland more democratic and accountable to the people and make Scotland a better place to live. Given that choice, I have every confidence that the people of Scotland will choose Labour's option and that of the constitutional convention in preference to anything on offer from the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

However, there were two matter of considerable interest in his speech: first, he did not answer any of the detailed questions asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) and the hon. Member for Glasgow, Goven (Mr. Sillars). Secondly—it is, perhaps, more significant—he was speaking not on his own behalf but on behalf of the Labour party. We now understand that it is Labour party policy to have a three-way referendum on the Scottish issue—[Hon. Members: "No."] I understood the hon. Gentleman to say that he was in favour of a referendum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To refresh the Minister's memory, I asked him why he is afraid to have a referendum in Scotland so that the people can choose between the Government's status quo and the convention's proposals for a Scottish Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The proposals of the Conservative and Unionist party will be put to the people of the United Kingdom at the next general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The positions of the various parties were stated in the debate. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State spoke and my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North put the Unionist position. My hon. Friend silenced the Opposition with his excellent quotations from speeches by the Leader of the Opposition, the right hon. Member for Islwyn (Mr. Kinnock).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Sir David Steel), who has a long record of interest in constitutional matters, put the Liberal Democrat position. The hon. Member for Govan tore the Scottish Constitutional Convention apart even more effectively than he did at our last sitting. No one denies the Scottish National party's commitment to setting up a separate Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party's commitment to its beliefs varies according to the SNP percentage in the opinion polls. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said, there is no philosophical basis for its proposals. The history of the Labour party's proposals is one of political opportunism. The Labour party proposes whatever appears to be the best way to excise the Govan factor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one would deny the commitment of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) to his party's proposals. He has said several times that if and when a Scottish Assembly is set up by the next Labour Government, he will leave this place and serve on it. Perhaps we could have a show of hands by all those who will accompany him. 	<i>[Interruption].</i> The hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Ewing) is retiring anyway. By my count, four of his colleagues will accompany the hon. Member for Garscadden to the Scottish Assembly. That will be interesting. If the hon. Member for Dunfermline, West does not win in Garscadden at the next general election, he will be able to stand in the by-election if there is a Labour Government. As a result of this morning's proceedings, we have four commitments to Labour by-elections in the next Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Pathetic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall see. The hon. Gentleman has changed his mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Falkirk, West quoted this from the claim of right:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We do hereby acknowledge the sovereign right of the Scottish people to determine the form of Government best suited to their needs".</p></blockquote>
I take that to be the Labour party's position. If one acknowledges the sovereign right of the Scottish people, one must acknowledge the sovereign right of the English people to determine the form of government best suited to their needs. [Hon. Members: "Yes, we do."] If hon. Gentlemen do that, they cannot believe in the sovereignty of the United Kingdom Parliament. Of course the Scottish National party does not, but the Labour party cannot believe in both. If hon. Gentlemen do not want to take my

	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
word for it, they can take the word of Strathclyde paper No. 78 on government and politics produced by the department of government at the university of Strathclyde. It makes clear that there is a clash between those two concepts. The Labour party cannot believe in both of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The future of the United Kingdom is not unimportant. Does the Minister believe that, as Europe evolves, the United Kingdom with its various constituents will remain as it is? Europe will evolve and develop. Power will be devolved from Brussels. Does the Under-Secretary believe that the make-up of the United Kingdom will continue as it is?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is raising a separate issue. The Labour party cannot get out of the point that I am making. One can either believe in the popular sovereignty of the people of Scotland to decide on their future and the popular sovereignty of the people of England to do the same, or one can believe in the sovereignty of the United Kingdom Parliament, but one cannot believe in both.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already given way on this point. I shall make another point and then give way to the hon. Gentleman. The hon. Gentleman made great play of the vast movement of opinion in Scotland in favour of the Labour party's position on this issue. However, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State pointed out the latest MORI poll figures. As a result of the massive publicity campaign launched by the Scottish Constitutional Convention, the figures for support of a Scottish Assembly have changed from 49 per cent in June 1989 to 33 per cent now. The figure in 	<i>The Independent</i> was some 37 per cent. If one put the two figures together, support of the status quo has almost doubled over that period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Falkirk, West suggested that the subject is at the forefront of Scottish politics. He should examine that poll, which shows that in June 1989 independence and devolution ranked third out of 12 issues. As a result of the continuing campaign for the constitutional convention, in 1990 it ranked 10th and according to the latest figures, it ranks 12th.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Under-Secretary of State give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have promised to give way to the hon. Member for Garscadden.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Under-Secretary accept that while one can argue for the right of people to decide how they wish to be governed, they may decide to exercise that right by sharing sovereignty within the United Kingdom? [	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does the Under-Secretary laugh in that idiot—I use the word advisedly—fashion when he and his Government believe in the future of the European Community? Will he answer this question that I have asked him repeatedly? If, in the interests of better government, Westminster decides on devolution of power to Scotland, will the Government, as a reprisal, allocate resources on the basis not of need, but of an average per capita throughout the United Kingdom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seems to be getting a little irritable this morning. My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North dealt with that earlier when the hon. Member for Garscadden was out of the Room.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about the Under-Secretary dealing with that question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Labour party is failing to face the realities of what would happen to public expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must press the Under-Secretary on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. the hon. Gentleman made a long speech and I have given way several times. The hon. Members for Garscadden and for Falkirk, West did not face the most significant issue that has dogged the entire debate—the west Lothian question. The hon. Member for Garscadden did not even mention it. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] If he made a passing reference to it, I shall examine what he said with great interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman reads again the independent survey and analysis of the constitutional convention, he will note that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The failure to address the implications for the rest of the UK—which has consistently proved the major stumbling block in Westminster—is the most significant omision from its deliberations apart from how to bring the Parliament into being."</p></blockquote>
We have had the claim of right, the deliberations of the convention, a discussion document, and the grand-sounding report to the Scottish people entitled, "Towards Scotland's Parliament", yet what do we hear about the west Lothian question? After all that, the convention can say only, "It's going to be all right folks, there's going to be a working group." After years of debate and failure to answer questions, there is to be a working group. What a farce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When asked, "Do you think that a Scottish Assembly is a good idea?" many people will, of course, answer yes, as they always have. However, there are more detailed questions to be asked—about taxation, for example, as my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North said, about the West Lothian question and about the position of the Secretary of State for Scotland. The right hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale says that he is against having a Secretary of State for Scotland in the Cabinet after an Assembly is established. Is that Labour party policy also? We do not know. In response to such questions, the hon. Member for Falkirk, East merely deteriorates into vulgar abuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has shown again that the Labour party will not answer the real questions about its proposals. The Conservative party and the Government have put forward a range of practical, sensible and workable proposals. All we have had from the Labour party this morning is a lot of general talk, general insults and a complete failure to answer any of the real questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
