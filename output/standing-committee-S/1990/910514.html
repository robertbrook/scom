	<div class='legislation'>Draft Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 (Licensing of Houses in Multiple Occupation) Order 1991</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 (Licensing Houses in Multiple Occupation) Order 1991.</p></blockquote>
Despite the length of its title, the order is short—but because the background to it is rather complex, and the processes that led to it have involved a good deal of time and consultation, the Committee may find it useful if I go into a little detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members will know, houses in multiple occupation are found in a number of Scottish towns and cities, but especially in cities and areas where there are many single people, often young people, who need accommodation. University and college students are among the largest group in that category, and HMOs are prevalent for that reason in the west end of Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Stirling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The existence of HMOs in large numbers, and the fact that landlords find it worth their while to provide them, clearly indicate that they are giving a service for which there is a real demand, and it is not our intention to interfere, or to prevent that demand being met. However, in recent years there have been increasing indications that many HMOs are falling below—sometimes, well below—proper standards, and we are concerned that local authorities should be enabled to tackle that problem effectively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Norman A. Godman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Port Glasgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister say whether the definition of a house in multiple occupation would include, for example, a large Victorian house in the west end of Greenock that has been divided into four or five flats by professional builders?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will give the hon. Gentleman a specific answer later, when my remarks will cover the subject of definitions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A consultative paper issued by the then Scottish Development Department in July 1988 set out the problem in some detail. The kind of HMO which creates a real problem, it suggested, was typically a property.
	<br><blockquote><p>"let by an absentee landlord, on something less than a legal tenancy if that can be obtained, to a large number of people who have no connection with each other."</p></blockquote>
Bad HMOs have a number of features that make them unsatisfactory, or worse, to their occupants, neighbours, and society. Such properties often charge much more than the service that they provide is worth. They have few, or no, places for occupants to wash themselves or their clothes; or inadequate cooking facilities, or none at all; and provide insufficient heating, lighting and hot water—and may overcharge for what is supplied by using high-tariff meters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Such properties are badly furnished and overcrowded, seasonally or permanently; are poorly maintained, repaired and decorated; and annoy their neighbours by being the source of noise and other nuisances. To sum up, common failings are the lack of washing and cooking facilities; inadequate heating, lighting and furnishing; and poor maintenance and overcrowding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities have powers to control HMOs under various Acts, going back to the Public Health (Scotland) Act 1987. The largest and most important group of such powers is in Part VIII of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987, and the 1964 regulations for the management of houses and buildings in multiple occupation, which enable local authorities to register HMOs in their areas, obtain information about them, see that work is carried out to keep them in proper repair, and, if all else fails, to take over the management of an HMO.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we wanted to know how much use local authorities made of their powers, and whether they thought that they could be improved, in 1988 we asked all those in Scotland to make returns showing to what extent they made of their Part VIII powers. We followed that up with a consultation paper setting out the problem in detail and inviting comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The results showed that authorities found Part VIII powers rather difficult to use; that they would welcome action by the Government to draw up and to issue guidance on the various Acts and regulations that apply to HMOs, so as to set out clearly local authority powers and duties; and that they were generally strongly in favour of a scheme that would require the operator of an HMO to be licenced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned local authorities' powers. What discussions have taken place recently between the Scottish Office and officials at the Department of Social Security headquarters in Lady Lawson Street, Edinburgh, on the role played by the DSS, where that organisation pays the rates of tenants living in houses in multiple occupation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are in touch with the DSS about that. Key representations were made by local authorities and interested groups. I cannot give the hon. Gentleman a snap answer to his question because it requires some thought, but if the houses concerned were separate, they would not come under the order. A conversion into separate flats, none of which is occupied by a number of persons in excess of the qualifying number, would not be covered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar: 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Garscadden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister can say something about the specific test that will be applied before granting a licence. He gave an impressive list of disasters that could befall neighbours and tenants if houses in multiple occupation are not regulated properly. What will that test be?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order's definition of a house in multiple occupation is
	<br><blockquote><p>"the only or principal residence of more than 4 persons".</p></blockquote>
Glasgow, which has more than 50 per cent. of the houses in multiple occupation in the whole of Scotland, reckons that 60 per cent. of its HMO stock will be excluded from the licensing scheme by the cut-off. Glasgow is unhappy about that, and I hope that the Minister will deal with that matter at length.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0496">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The order specifies that a house in multiple occupation must be occupied by more than four persons, and that those persons must be
	<br><blockquote><p>"not all members either of the same family or of one or other of 2 families."</p></blockquote>
The reason for those numbers is to form a commonsense definition of an HMO. We did not want it to cover a home occupied by a single family of five or more persons, a family home where a lodger had been taken in, or a flat occupied by a group of three or four students. The definition adopted excludes a home occupied by a single family, because all the occupants are members of the same family; a lodger, even where the total number of occupants is more than four, because they are members of no more than two families; and the student flat, because even though the occupants are from more than two families, their total number is fewer than five.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a sensible approach to the question of numbers. We considered carefully the responses to our consultations, and found that Glasgow's view differed from that of many other authorities, which suggested a different limit. We will review the numbers limit in the light of experience, but I am happy to give an undertaking that if the order is approved, and if the numbers undermine seriously the licensing power's effectiveness, we shall consider amending it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) will press the Minister later on the issue, but I am intervening now because I have been approached by people whose views I respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise the differing opinions that exist among local authorities. I have spoken also to Edinburgh district council, which takes a different attitude. Does the Minister dispute Glasgow district council's claim that 60 per cent. of properties that it defines as HMO stock will be excluded from the licensing scheme that the order will introduce?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There can be no dispute that when a family of six, seven or 12 members live together, that must be classed as multiple occupation. However, there is a danger that bad landlords may buy smaller flats and pop in four students or single people to avoid licensing. That would push the problem further down the range of housing in a dangerous and unacceptable way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not dispute the hon. Gentleman's figures. On a commonsense basis, we are uncertain whether the problem relates to the properties that he cited or to larger properties in multiple occupation, where we think that the worst abuses have been committed. If we find evidence of abuses in future, notwithstanding the terms of the order, we shall consider amending the order as appropriate. At present, the order is the sensible way forward and covers the majority of cases that have been highlighted in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.41 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At present, Glasgow district council inspects properties under the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987. Will the Minister confirm that the licensing being introduced is additional to that Act, and will not replace it? Secondly, can he assure us that he will not attempt to change the 1987 Act's definition of HMOs, to bring it more into line with the new licensing procedure, and that, although Glasgow district council cannot use licensing to control HMOs, it will still be able to use the 1987 Act?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to both questions is yes. The district council has that discretion, and the order will provide it with an additional power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not intervene much more, but I want the Minister to say a word or two about the interaction between the licensing system and planning control. I understand that certain requirements are made under the planning Acts that local authorities enforce.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The order does not impair the power of local authorities to act; it is additional to their existing powers. Therefore, no problem arises in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While we do not at present have a legislative opportunity to revise the statutes that apply to HMOs, we have taken steps to deal with other important points. For example, a code of guidance setting out the variety of powers and duties that are available to local authorities is being drafted, which—should the order be approved, —would give guidance on the use on the new powers. That guidance will be ready for issue shortly, at about the time that the order comes into effect. The order will increase the powers and effectiveness of local authorities in dealing with HMOs, for they will be able to impose conditions that must be met before a licence is issued. If a landlord does not comply with those conditions, he would be committing an offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the matter first arose three years ago, in the context of the discussions on the Bill that led to the 1987 Act, I was asked why so few authorities in Scotland exercise those powers. We now know the answer, because of our extensive consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Replies from authorities to our 1988 paper highlighted two matters from a number that I have already mentioned. First, local authorities were certain that there would be a universal welcome for the issuing of a code of guidance on HMOs that draws together all the powers and duties of local authorities. Secondly, they left us in no doubt that the licensing of HMOs would be widely welcomed. So we are acting on both issues. I regard the publication of a code of guidance—which, as I said, we debated several years ago—as particularly important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May we obtain copies as soon as possible? Where there is a growth in the number of houses in multiple occupation, there is often a deterioration in the neighbourhood. That has a dismal effect on many of the decent people living in such localities. That is why I ask for a copy of the code.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As soon as the order comes into force, we intend that the code of guidance should also come into operation. That should happen very quickly—within weeks. I shall ensure that each member of the Committee receives a copy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with the contents of the order and the point of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) about testing. The order adds the use of a house in multiple occupation to the activities for which a licence may be required under part II of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982. That means that, where a local authority resolves to make a licensing scheme, every person wishing to carry on that activity must have a licence. He or she must comply with any reasonable conditions that the authority attaches to that licence. Such conditions are a matter for the authority concerned. He or she must give
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0497">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
access to local government officers and provide relevant information on request, and will be liable to a penalty if there is failure to meet those requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Licensing involves two important requirements. First, the licensee must observe all reasonable conditions. Secondly, he or she must be a fit and proper person. That means, a person who is fit and proper to carry out the terms of the licence. That general term was used in the 1982 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am intrigued by the suggestion that a fit and proper person is a fit and proper person to operate such premises. Do the Government envisage that there will be a check with the police to see whether potential licence holders have previous convictions? Will there be other ways of checking applicants' records? The obvious method would be to look back through the licensing records, to ascertain whether there had been trouble with previous licences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Presumably, I could have three or four people staying with me, and I would not have to apply for a licence. If at some time I decided that was nonsense and shoved someone else into the spare box room, I would then become licensable, and would commit an offence if I do not apply for a licence. Is it a self-policing system, with the landlord having to bear that in mind in deciding his occupancy policy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Someone who has a criminal record and engages in criminal activities, would be excluded. Similarly, if someone had a drug or alcohol problem, he or she might not be classified as a fit and proper person. It is a matter of common sense and evidence. I do not envisage witch hunts, but practical, commonsense measures can be taken where necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order defines the terms "house" and "house in multiple occupation" for the purposes of licensing. The definition that we have chosen of a "house" is one that we think should cover all the categories of properties within which a house in multiple occupation may fall. As hon. Members may be aware, we considered an alternative form of words, on which comments were invited when we consulted about the content of the draft order in October last year. However, although it was closer to the current definition in part VIII of the 1987 Act, it gave rise to certain unwanted consequences. In particular, there were certain circumstances in which it could have applied to houses in a tenement occupied by a single family. Therefore, we decided in favour of the present wording.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the purposes of the order, we had to take a view on what constituted the sort of house in multiple occupation that it was desired to catch. At one end of the scale, no one doubts that the landlord of a "17 doorbell" size of HMO should be liable to be caught by licensing; at the other, it seemed unreasonable that it should apply to a single family that takes in a lodger. Therefore, we decided that on commonsense grounds the qualifying level should be a house that was the "only or principal residence" of more than four people who were not all members of one family or of one or other of two families.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know from the responses to consultations that some would have preferred a lower number than four, or no qualifying number at all, to be specified. To that I would say simply the order is directed at houses in multiple occupation, and not at the rented sector generally, and that we think it only reasonable to include a working definition
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
of "multiple occupation". But we have made it clear that, if the experience of local authorities that operate schemes suggests that a differenct level would be appropriate, we shall consider it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the order excludes from the conditions that a licensing authority may impose on that grant of a licence any condition concerning rents or other charges. Controls on rents, and the relationship of rent control to housing benefit, are regulated separately under the rent and housing Acts, and it would not be appropriate to bring them into a system aimed at regulating the physical condition of premises. This order meets a real demand, and it will usefully strengthen the hand of authorities that have to deal with houses of poor standard providing a low level of accommodation, at what is frequently a high price.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In general, the Government are to be congratulated on giving local authorities the ability to have licences for houses in multiple occupation. It would be carping of me not to say so. It is easy to argue that houses in multiple occupation are an evil that should be eliminated, but they meet an essential need of many single people, students, unemployed persons, young people who have left home, and others. The Minister rightly pointed out that such houses are open to a massive scale of exploitation by unscrupulous landlords, and the people who live in them, and their neighbours, must be defended against their worse excesses.

Local authorities should have effective, but flexible, licensing schemes to ensure that the standards of management and physical conditions of HMOs are regulated and improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has taken a long time for the Government to come round to the view that there should be licences. The Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 has been on the statute book for some time, and we put on the record our congratulations to the local authorities, and the Scottish Council for the Single Homeless and its director, Laurie Naumann, for campaigning for licensing powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) apologised for having to leave the Committee, but he has another meeting at 11 o'clock. He made it clear that an argument has been going on for some time, especially in Glasgow, as to the proper definition of houses in multiple occupation. He made it clear that Glasgow district councils believe that the order's artificial cut-off of four persons will remove from the licensing scheme many properties that the 1987 Act defines as houses of multiple occupation. I refer to houses with three people or fewer living in them, such as small flats in tenement properties in the west end of Glasgow—which city accounts for more than 50 per cent. of houses in multiple occupation in Scotland. More than 70 per cent. of property in the west end of Glasgow consists of HMOs, which is a very large concentration. Sections of that area have been dragged down as a result, with many students, nurses and unemployed persons desperately seeking any type of accommodation because nothing else is available for them. As a consequence, property values are lowered and the area goes downhill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Glasgow district council has grave reservations about the Minister's scheme. It says that if the Government go ahead with the order without amending it to incorporate the definition that the council wants, it might not introduce a licensing scheme. If 60 per cent. of the houses that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0498">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
council defines as houses in multiple occupation are not included under the scheme, it feels that it may as well use its existing powers under the 1987 Act, rather than introduce a more complicated system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman talking about the single ends or single rooms that might be occupied by more than the number stated, which would make them multiple-occupancy properties? If so, has Glasgow district council defined those single ends as a category, and may it do so under the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Glasgow district council defines 2,000 houses as being in multiple occupation. They can have two, three or four people living in exactly the sort of tenement accommodation to which the hon. Gentleman referred. Glasgow district council says that if the definition of houses in multiple occupation excludes 60 per cent. of the 2,000 houses that it defines as HMOs, there is little point in its introducing a licensing scheme that excludes those properties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We understand that such regulations cannot be amended. The Minister obviously believes—and I take his word—that the existing legislation can continue to be used, and there will be no attempt to amend it in any way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Minister for his assurance that he will review the numbers provided for under the order after it has come into effect and will, if necessary, amend it to ensure better control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that there will be a guidance document—call it a code of guidance—to help local authorities to draw up their licensing schemes. I am glad to have the Minister's assurance that the code will be available on 3 June, when the order comes into force. At least, I assume that is what he meant, because there would be little point to introducing a licensing power if local authorities have no guidance from the Government as to how they should exercise it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The guidance will enable local authorities to start work with the required urgency. Will the document suggest which department should be the lead department in a district council? That is important. Many local authorities believe that their environmental health departments should play the major role in controlling houses in multiple occupation. A property's physical condition and its lack of amenities rightly cause the greatest anxiety. However, some believe that the housing department, not the department of environmental health should play the leading role in the licensing process, principally because —I hope that the Minister will assure me on this point—licensing will not be just about the physical conditions of a property and its facilities. Almost as important is its proper management. There must be proper procedures for setting rent levels—I do not mean stating what the rent will be—to ensure that they are agreed between the tenant or occupier and the landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should also be arrangements for proper, written agreements between the landlord and tenant. Tenants have the right to privacy, advance notice before inspection, and to settled occupancy in one room in a property. That last point is especially important. Sometimes, people return from a weekend away to find that they have to move to a different room. Tenants' rights should be laid down in the licensing procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The measures for tenants' protection are extremely important, especially for vulnerable individuals—such as those with mental handicaps, who leave institutions but cannot be housed by the local authority housing department. They could find a tenancy in such a house, so it is essential that mentally-handicapped tenants should be protected from avaricious landlords.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. I am raising the issue so that the Minister can say whether a licence would require the landlord to make such arrangements. Our aim is not merely to ensure not only that a house is properly maintained—with facilities such as toilets, baths and so on—but that its tenants are protected by proper agreements between them and the landlord that can be enforced by the courts. The housing department would have a higher level of expertise in dealing with such agreements—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that all that matters is that there should be an agreement? Surely he is not suggesting the housing department should try to inflict its will in respect of the agreement's contents?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Within reason, no. Obviously, certain things should not be allowed in agreements. The licensing authority should give guidance to landlords about the terms of any agreement. Although they may not be entirely enforceable, but I hope that certain aspects would be laid down. I agree with the hon. Gentleman up to a point. We cannot put into licences conditions that would discourage landlords from letting their houses, and thus create more homelessness. However, we are entitled to expect reasonable standards in the quality of a house and its management. I assume that is what the Minister meant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More important, it will have to deal with the consequences of a licensing scheme. There is no point in licensing houses of multiple occupation if the local authority does not use its power to refuse a licence, or to withdraw a licence because its terms are not met. The licence will set out specific conditions, which some landlords will not meet. Presumably, properties owned by such landlords will cease to be houses of multiple occupation, and the people living in them will be made homeless. The local authority housing department will be responsible for ensuring that such people are rehoused. They must be made aware of that possibility, and make contingency plans to tackle it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to hear from the Minister about the criteria that will be included in the licence, which could lead a local authority to refuse or revoke a licence. My hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden gave one example. A police record and the subsequent unsuitability of the landlord are part and parcel of the criteria. Persons who have a criminal record should not necessarily be excluded from being landlords. The offence should be relevant to their activities as a landlord, and one should not simply decide that, because a 40-year-old committed a breach of the peace when he was 18, he should be refused a licence. That would be absurd. However, some sort of check must be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The licence itself could create offences. If the licence stipulates that harassment of tenants is not permissible, a landlord would commit an offence if he harassed tenants to get them out of the house or to raise rents. If his licence was then revoked, he would have a criminal record, which would prevent him from becoming landlord of a HMO in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0499">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
another local authority area. I presume that the guidance document will set out sanctions that local authorities may use guidelines about enforcement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raised many points, which I hope are worthwhile. I hope also that they are helpful and not simply critical. The Opposition welcome licensing for houses of multiple occupation. That is the way forward. I hope that English hon. Members will note that there is no such legislation for England and Wales. Their housing Minister can now make similar provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.9 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ray Michie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll and Bute)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: During our discussions last year about grants for fire escapes in houses of multiple occupation, we looked forward to the draft order, which introduces a licensing scheme for such properties. As the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) said, I hope that it will set much-needed standards, not only for the physical and safety aspects of such houses, but their management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister listed some of the common problems such property presents, and which have led to the order. He mentioned inadequate heating and lighting, which are often not simply inadequate but downright dangerous. Hon. Members will have seen horrendous numbers of electrical appliances connected to the same adaptor or plugged into one socket. The dangers are frightening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Cathcart that there has been much discussion and argument about the definition of multiple occupation. Local authorities should be allowed to implement the order and to commence licensing. After a suitable period has elapsed, the number of people to which the order applies should be reviewed, because it is not clear that the Government's limit of four persons is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, too, welcome the order, which has been urged on the Government since 1985—especially by the Scottish Council for the Single Homeless. I congratulate the Government on having introduced the order in Scotland. Such an order is being sought for England and Wales, and I hope that those countries will follow suit. However, that is a matter for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends and I believe that the Government are getting the balance right, and Scottish Members generally have lived with the phenomenon of lodgers since the people deserted the land for the big cities. I remember when people from the country used to arrive in the towns with their chests, which they kept with them, because an agricultural worker moved around and would live in a bothy. Our cities have a history of lodgers, and the Government recognise that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever their circumstances, students and nurses often live in houses in multiple occupation because they enjoy sharing and prefer that to the dormitory conditions of hostels and hospitals—where such provision is made. Our large cities, especially Glasgow and Edinburgh—and, to a lesser extent Aberdeen—will always need such accommodation. Dundee, which is not listed, also has houses in multiple occupation. When my daughter was a student at Dundee university, I visited her in such accommodation. It was a happy flat on the Perth road, full of young girls who enjoyed life. They lived in what I
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
thought was a bit of a tip, but they were happy—and all graduated with good degrees. Students seem to thrive and prosper in such circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another group that lives in houses in multiple occupation are people who obtain work in the large cities and have to find accommodation, often at short notice. Further, we must recognise that it is common among the immigrant population for many people to live in relatively small premises, which presents health and safety problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was necessary to do something about MODs in Scotland, and was right for the Government to bring forward this order. Unlike the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton), I would hesitate about dealing with single ends. We must find a way of dealing with them where they exist as I accept that there is a problem, but if we dealt with numbers below four it would create difficulties in the country areas, and would not solve the problem of the single end. It would create problems in areas where they do not exist at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Glasgow has probably already found a way under the present regulations of dealing with the problem of single ends in which more than four people are living. The mind boggles at that. Those of us who know what single ends are realise that some sort of bunk beds are needed to accommodate more than four people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a mistake if he limits his argument to single ends. Obviously two-room flats can come into that category too. If three students live in a flat with two or three rooms, and even if they each have a bedroom, it is still multiple occupation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having grown up in a tenement and in a house of two rooms, and being one of eight children, I know something about multiple occupancy at first hand. I understand that a two-roomed house in which one room is a bedroom-cum-living room-cum-kitchen-cum-everything presents problems, particularly when more than four people are living in it. But if it is three people, with one in one bedroom and two in the other, they might be able to live quite comfortably. More than that, and there are problems. Four people could certainly live in a two-roomed apartment—to use a nice, modern phrase to describe something that we had in great numbers in our big cities in Scotland. Four is about the right figure, except for single ends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.18 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also welcome the measure. I will say more about the need to protect vulnerable people who are not able to defend themselves, as the rest of us can, in their dealings with professional agencies or landlords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I live in what can only be described as an elegant, Victorian sandstone listed terrace. One of the houses there has now slipped into multiple occupation. It is scruffy in appearance with an overgrown, litter-strewn garden—which is of considerable concern to the neighbours, including me. Not only is there a general air of squalor, but the problem—which is a major one in my constituency—of noisy neighbours. That is a common problem, and one about which we hear often in our surgeries. My personal experience allows me to sympathise more readily with constituents who come to my surgeries to complain about, say, a nearby house which is now in multiple occupation, when there has been a swift deterioration in its condition and in the immediate surroundings. There can be major
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0500">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
problems, and it seems to me that landlords have a responsibility not only to their tenants but to those in the neighbourhood of their houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the licences and to the definition of fit and proper persons. It is essential for local authorities to keep a close watch on such premises. I welcome the concept of the code of guidance to which the Minister referred. It will be especially important for vulnerable people, as we have a duty to protect their interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many in our communities are middle-aged, suffer from mental handicaps, and have been cared for in the past by parents who are now too old or too infirm to look after them. Such fellow citizens are encouraged to find lodgings of some sort, and it is essential to protect them under the code of guidance and the powers that local authorities will have to bring into line the occasional unscrupulous landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked the Minister earlier whether consultations about the measure had taken place between his officials and those in the DSS's headquarters in Edinburgh. The DSS may have a role to play in meeting the needs of vulnerable tenants—such as, by helping them to pay their rent. Such tenants may have their fuel bills paid out of their social security incomes to the electricity board. I wonder whether, in addition to consultations with the DSS, social work departments could be consulted too, because they have a role to play. Sometimes, they can be heavy-handed towards protecting the interests of decent, law-abiding, and honourable constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cite the example of a young woman who came to my surgery in Greenock to complain about the appalling difficulties that she had encountered with two neighbours. She is a tenant of Scottish Homes, and because of an agreement between that agency and the local social work department, the two houses on either side of her tenement flat had been rented out to the social work department, which, in turn let them to two dreadfully unruly tenants. One result of that was fine, in that two young people who had a history of disturbance were housed in decent accommodation—but their behaviour impinged grossly on the life of that young woman and her two young children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I of course complained to the social work department and to Scottish Homes about the insensitivity of placing two difficult young people in a tenement up a close, and inadvertently causing such misery for those decent constituents of mine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the measure. I do suggest that local authorities should carry out a rigorous surveillance of such landlords, but they should be closely attuned to the need to protect tenants in houses in multiple occupation, especially tenants who, for one reason or another, are not fully able to defend their interests, as ordinary people can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.25 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been a useful debate. I welcome the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker). Houses in multiple occupation are particularly important in the case of students, many of whom rely on them. I agree with the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman) that vulnerable people must be protected. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) expressed his support for licensing. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) also seemed in favour of it. I agree also with the hon. Member for Cathcart in his
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
remarks about the work of the Scottish Council for the Single Homeless, which has been extremely helpful in conducting surveys.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall review the order and its outcome in the light of developments. I repeat that undertaking, as the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie) was worried about that aspect. We aim at issuing the code of guidance in June, but we shall have to consult the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities before that, so it is unlikely to be issued before 3 June. It is a guidance document, but not a statutory code like the homelessness code.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can a copy of the 	<i>Official Report</i> of the Committee's proceedings be sent to officials of COSLA, together with the draft guidelines? It may be useful for COSLA's representatives to read the warnings that have been made in our exchanges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I shall be happy to ensure that is done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked which should be the lead department. We believe that each local authority should decide for itself, but the guidance will stress the need for proper liaison and cooperation between not only departments, but all those involved in the control of HMOs—for example, the police and fire authorities. I should have mentioned earlier that there are copies of a paper on the table which is available to all Committee members, showing the use of legislation governing houses in multiple occupation under seven different provisions—for example, notices requiring the provision of means of escape from fire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I accept that licensing is up to the local authority, can it be made clear that it is a district council—not a regional council—function? At least three of the departments involved in licensing will be regional departments—the social security department and the police and fire authorities. There may be others. For example, in some cases the education authority may be involved, if the houses in multiple occupation serve a college of further education and are under its control—although that is becoming less common. How will proper liaison be ensured?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me give an example. Glasgow has used notices requiring provision of means of escape from fire in 284 cases, and notices requiring compliance with standards in 192 cases—so Glasgow has made full use of existing legislation, to which the order is additional.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Housing departments will have to deal with the consequences for tenants when a licence is refused or withdrawn. That has implications for homelessness, as hon. Members have pointed out. Local authorities will of course assess people under the homelessness legislation and fulfil their duties. Generally, local authorities have dealt sympathetically with people made homeless by their action to control unsatisfactory HMOs, but the guidance document will alert local authorities to that aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
HMOs for persons with special needs—for example, the mentally handicapped—merit careful attention. Such premises may require registration with the social work authority. Those powers are dealt with in the guidance. COSLA will be consulted, and that will cover the social work interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0501">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
The question was raised of whether a local authority will have the power to enter premises where it believes that activities requiring a licence are being undertaken without one. Under the 1982 Act, a licence will not be renewed or granted to a landlord if he has had a licence revoked within a specified previous period, or withdrawn by a court. The general condition that a licence should be granted only to a "fit and proper" person gives the local authority broad powers to determine whether a landlord's previous record makes him unsuitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about harrassment. That is a criminal offence, not simply a civil matter. It is dealt with fully in the 1982 Act. With regard to statistics on HMOs, we do not have the actual numbers, but we believe that the April 1991 census will provide further useful information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me comment on the protection of the mentally handicapped and vulnerable people. Under the new community care arrangements, social work authorities will be responsible for providing a care plan for individuals and for liaising with housing authorities where there is a housing need.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In some instances, we may ask local authorities to police their own activities. I refer to women's refuges that have been supplied to local women's groups by the housing department. In the Clyde there is a women's refuge that is a council house. In such cases, presumably, we will ask the local authorities to police their own activities as landlords.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that not already happen, when the environmental health department checks on council properties?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that does already happen. Women's refuges could be categorised as HMOs. The main concern would be not the landlord, but whether confidentiality is maintained. People who have been battered want to get away and for their new whereabouts to be kept confidential.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That raises a series of other questions, about not only women's refuges, but social work homes run for adults, hostels run by local authorities for homeless people, and hostels run by a university or college for its students. Will such accommodation require a licence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must exercise a measure of common sense. We want to license HMOs where there is potential for abuse. We are thinking not of women's refuges or students' residences, but of larger HMOs. At an earlier stage, we considered whether there was a case for more general provisions with exemptions attached to them. However, we did not go down that path because it was impractical to draft them with sufficient precision. That would have left a numbdr of loopholes for potentially unscrupulous landlords to exploit. We had doubts about the vires of including exemptions on the basis of the ownership of properties, so we considered that exemptions were best left to local discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been pointed out that England has not gone down that path, but that measures have been undertaken south of the border. The powers of local authorities in England and Wales were strengthened in respect of the registration of HMOs through the amendment of part XI of the Housing Act 1985 and schedule 9 to the Local Government and Housing Act 1989. Therefore, action has been taken south of the border.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
