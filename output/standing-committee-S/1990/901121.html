	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Robert Key)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Code of Audit Practice for England and Wales.</p></blockquote>
The Local Government Finance Act 1982 established the Audit Commission as an independent body both to appoint external auditors for local authorities and to help those authorities secure value for money in the services that they provided. Section 14 of the 1982 Act requires the Audit Commission to prepare, and to keep under review, a code of audit practice prescribing the way in which auditors are to carry out their functions under part III of the Act. The National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 amended the 1982 Act by extending the functions of the commission to cover health authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The commission believes that the code should be a single document covering the audit of both local and health authorities, so it has revised and extended the existing version. The code must receive parliamentary approval at least every five years, although the commission can make alterations to the code in the intervals between its being approved. The present code came into effect on 9 February 1988. It was revised by the commission on 7 July 1988 to deal with the new powers on prohibition orders and judicial review introduced by the Local Government Act 1988. The Audit Commission has now prepared the revised code, which is before the Committee. The commission considered that as this revision deals with health service bodies for the first time, the code should be brought before Parliament for approval, even though fewer than five years have elapsed since the code was last approved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The code is the commission's code, prepared by the commission. Its members represent a wide range of interests in the public and private sectors, and reflect wide experience of financial management relevant to auditing local government and national health service bodies. As required by the 1982 Act, the commission has consulted the bodies most directly concerned—local authority associations, the accountancy profession and, for the first time, organisations connected with the health service. It has also been the subject of consultation with the commission's own auditors—the National Audit Office—the district audit service and the private accountancy firms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the existing code has helped to ensure that auditors' functions under part III of the 1982 Act have been carried out effectively. It is right that the commission should, from time to time, reconsider the code to determine whether it needs to be updated or improved in the light of experience and of developments in professional audit practice. It is especially appropriate for the commission to revise the code to take account of the extension of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
commission's remit to health service bodies consequent on the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990, and to seek parliamentary approval for its revised code.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My role in this matter is limited to bringing the code to the Committee for consideration and, I hope, approval. It might be helpful, however, if I remind the Committee of the main features of the code and outline the principal changes from the existing code, especially those features that the commission regards as important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first point to note is that, in essence, the code that applied to local authorities has now been extended to cover the national health service, except for those matters where such extension is simply not possible. That is an important point. The commission believes that the principles of local authority audit have been well established, and the code is well regarded. When the Government extended the remit of the commission and of the auditors it appoints to cover health service bodies, the commission decided that the successful code for local authorities should be transferred to health service bodies to strengthen their accountability. I am sure that the commission is right to stick to a proven formula.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The introduction provides a general explanation of the reasons why the commission has framed the code as it has done, pointing out that not all aspects of the code will be appropriate for the audit of what the code calls "non-principal" authorities—such as parish and community councils and, in the health service, general practice fund holders. The main body of the code has been considerably rearranged, compared with the existing code, but incorporates much of it effectively unchanged, except for those changes necessitated by the national health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The code is now divided into five parts. The first sets out the general duties of the auditor. Paragraphs 13 and 14 are new and cover audit objectives. The second part contains new matter in paragraphs 17 to 23 inclusive, which cover planning the audit, controlling and recording the audit, accounting systems and internal controls, and audit evidence. The second part also prescribes the procedures that the auditor should observe in conducting the audit and identifies matters to which the auditor should pay particularly close attention—fraud, corruption and value for money. Paragraphs 24 to 39 of the second part and the whole of the third part, which brings together the auditor's reporting responsibilities, are, for all practical purposes, an unchanged rearrangement of the existing code. Part 4 is specific to the audit of local authorities and is merely a rearrangement of the existing code. Part 5 relates to the audit of health service bodies, and is therefore entirely new.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part I of the code is headed "Duties of an Auditor". The commission has retained the material dealing with factors that it believes should characterise the work of an auditor in local government, in particular independence and due professional care and responsibility to the public. As before, the commission considers those specific aspects in detail against the background of the commission's basic approach, which is set out in paragraph (8).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That basic approach is, as the words imply, fundamental to the code, so it may be helpful if I highlight what the code says. First, it stresses that special care and consideration apply to the audit of public funds. The auditor must satisfy
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0187">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
himself that such funds have been legally spent and accounted for and, echoing the words of both the 1982 Act and the Local Govt Finance Act 1987,
	<br><blockquote><p>"that proper practices have been observed". He must also consider whether arrangements have been made to ensure value for money. The auditor's work must be characterised by a common sense, general appreciation of the subject matter and a constructive and co-operative approach, although the auditor must not hesitate to pursue conclusions to the point of public criticism if necessary. The auditor is also required to co-operate in the transfer of the knowledge of good practice from one authority to another.</p></blockquote>
I come now to the new material in the code, which has not been previously considered in Committee. The commission may make alterations to the code in the interval after it has been approved by Parliament. Since the Committee last considered the code on 20 January 1988, the commission has amended it to reflect new powers given to auditors to issue a prohibition order or to apply to the courts for a judicial review of a decision taken by a local authority. Those powers were conferred in the Local Government Act 1988. The revised code sets out the way in which auditors should use those powers. I stress that, in both cases, the auditor has a power, not a duty, and that the auditor's discretion must be exercised in accordance with normal administrative law principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part 5, is headed
	<br><blockquote><p>"Audit of Health Service Bodies".</p></blockquote>
The commission stresses that auditors of health service bodies have particular responsibilities in addition to those that are common to both local government and the health service. The auditor has a duty under section 20(3) of the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 to report to the Secretary of State if it is believed that an authority's or officer's decision would involve unlawful expenditure, or that the authority's or officer's action would be unlawful and cause a loss or deficiency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission does not perceive it to be the auditor's duty to seek out such matters for refusal to the Secretary of State for Health, but when a matter is either brought to the auditor's attention by members, by officers of the authority, or by others, or arises as part of normal audit duties, the auditor is required to give such matters proper consideration. Particular attention should be given to any report made by an officer of the authority drawing attention to possible unlawful expenditure, courses of action leading to a loss or deficiency, or entry of an item of account or a likelihood of expenditure exceeding resources.

In so far as it is consistent with the prompt exercise of these powers, the auditor is required, where appropriate, to give the body under audit or officer involved an opportunity to respond to the matters giving cause for concern. That is not a statutory requirement and, in some circumstances, it may not be appropriate to hold such a consultation before referring the matter to the Secretary of State for Health. The referral of such matters to the Secretary of State for Health contrasts with the procedure in local government where the auditor, faced with similar matters, has to decide whether to issue a prohibition order or apply to the court for a judical review of the decision taken. The commission assumed responsibility for the audit of the health service on 1 October, and work upon the first year's audit has now begun. The commission's first national study on day-case surgery has recently been published and has been well received by both clinicians and managers.

In conclusion, I stress again that the code of audit practice is the work of the commission. I hope that the Committee will agree that the commission has fulfilled its task in a thorough and highly professional manner; and produced a code that charts a sensible and practical approach for auditors to follow. I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr David Blunkett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Brightside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After yesterday's events in Committee Room 12, I am afraid that this is an anti-climax, but given the numbers on my side I shall make no jokes about the Prime Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate the Minister on what I believe is his maiden speech in Committee in his new role, and I echo his words about commending the commission for the drafting of the report and the time and energy that it obviously took.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been no conflict between the Government and the Opposition about the role of the audit service. There is no contention between us. I wish to make that clear because there was a planted question at Prime Minister's Questions yesterday, which was answered by the Leader of the House. It related to remarks of mine that I shall clarify during my very short speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has never been an issue between the Government and ourselves that the audit service is a vital part of the propriety that we expect from local government, but we regret that, occasionally, there has been a politicisation of a function that should not be the subject of controversy or surrounded by any form of public dispute. I shall not dwell on the matter, but in the past problems arose over rate capping, which created difficulties between local auditors and their local authorities with regard to the role of the Audit Commission—which was then under a flamboyant controller, who is now the director-general of the Confederation of British Industry. He has lost none of his flamboyance in that job. Some of Audit Commission's public statements, as opposed to its detailed work, cause controversy. As with the code of practice, much of its day-to-day work is highly appreciated as it is vital for the protection of our democracy. It prevents people, whether inadvertently or otherwise, stepping outside acceptable audit and accountancy practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document that we are considering must be viewed in that light. We have no difficulties with the bulk of its contents, but some small items invite comment. The Association of District Councils is concerned about paragraph 58, and the question of when reporting a public interest would be triggered and whether that trigger should be automatic if there were any qualification of the opinion being offered. Discretion will be needed to ensure that small matters do not undermine the significance of reports on those issues, which concern all of us, and I do not doubt that auditors will use their common sense. They have a good record of dealing with problems before they occur, and when they can be remedied quickly. I believe that all Members of the Committee accept that view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, when some matters are revealed publicly there are two dangers. First, there can be unnecessary criticism of local government, which undermines the democratic process and discredits the level of propriety practised by the vast majority of local authorities, their officers and councilors—something that is unequalled in the rest of the world. Secondly, people are reluctant to take action at an early stage. I mention that because some of us
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0188">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
wished that action had been taken earlier in the case of the West Wiltshire district council. In the end, the local audit service did a good job by revealing the facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that it is difficult to obtain information through either the Audit Commission or the Director of Public Prosecutions. The case is still under consideration by the DPP, so I shall not go into it, other than to say that this is action that all of us, whatever the political control of the council involved, would wish to be taken at an early stage. If that action has been taken with other councils, police investigations might not now be necessary, several years after the event. There is unanimity between us, but a problem arises when ill-judged criticisms lead to statements that undermine or even discredit the worth while and agreed role of the commission and the audit service at district level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried at the press release issued last week by the Audit Commission on London direct labour organisations. That report dealt with important and worrying matters and revealed inefficiencies—levels of sickness and absenteeism; productivity compared with that in the private sector and even the conditions, such as holidays, offered by local councils that might be viewed as over-generous in the present state of the construction industry. I have no quarrel with those findings, and believe that such comparisons are vital for the stimulation of improvement and better management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the role of the audit service. It does not exist merely to check the accountancy regulations after the event, but the practice can be carried to extremes. For example, the audit service commented on the monitoring and sampling used to measure the satisfaction of the consumer. It was suggested that something must be wrong because only 50 per cent. of councils undertake such work. It is a pity that 100 per cent. do not, but a comparison has to be made with private-sector competitors. If a clear comparison had been made available, the remarks of the audit service might have been justified. However, I do not believe that there is any justification for saying that direct labour organisations are the major reason behind London's decaying fabric. Even Conservative Members must admit that he was stretching a point in terms of the problems of the capital, its infrastructure, its transport, the state of its roads, the shoddiness of many public places, major capital investment in both basic fabric and housing stock and the need for to which the Audit Commission in the mid 1980s under its previous controller, had drawn attention. The Audit Commission does itself no good by putting out statements that most people would view with incredulity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can we improve matters? First, we are in favour of a change in the direction that the Audit Commission and, therefore, the district audit service are expected to take. We believe that quality, efficiency and effectiveness should replace economy, efficiency and effectiveness, as quality rather than cheapness should be the benchmark by which we judge what we are getting for our money. Value-for-money statements have often proved beneficial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The emphasis on quality leads us to believe that under our proposed new quality commission, about which we shall be consulting early in the new year, the present Audit Commission should be subsumed into a new body so that the quality, the accountancy and the audit services will work closely in tandem, continuing the work of the present
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
district audit service. That would provide better service, with the emphasis on the long-term improvement of service to the customer rather than on the short-term cheapness of what people buy, which they often regret at considerable length.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the code is acceptable, there is considerable room for improvement to stimulate enterprise and initiative in local government in the way that created the local authority municipal scene in the late 19th century and the early part of this century. Much of what we have taken for granted until recent years was established by authorities using their initiative, and by the enterprise of their officers as well as that of the politicians. That is why some of us regret the statement issued by the Audit Commission about cross-boundary tendering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any tender drawn-up by a local authority should be on the basis of propriety. Loss leaders are not acceptable to local authorities. The disciplines that exist in the private sector through bankruptcy are not available to them, and we all accept that. However, if legal judgments by such a respected and important body as the Audit Commission relate to the tendering by one authority for another authority's activities in a way that discourages people from maximising the income of those authorities and their ability to use their work force to provide a public service, that is not an issue between our parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am talking about Conservative-controlled councils taking on work for Conservative-controlled councils. If such comments and legal advice have not been thoroughly discussed and tested with local authority associations and other professional bodies, they can do enormous harm by entrenching local government in sterile and stagnant positions. Instead of using the initiatives of people at local level, it would confine them within agreed boxes, and I do not believe that that should be the role of the commission or the audit service. Their role is to protect us from wrong doing and to ensure that there is adequate practice and that professionalism is paramount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following the 1988 and 1989 Acts, there are whistleblowers and regulations to ensure that people do not step over the boundaries of the law. I shall not vote against the code, but it was important to put those views on record so that no one is in any doubt about the Opposition's position. We can work with the Government on those matters on which we all agree and which, should not be disputed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dover)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend the Minister clarify two points about the code? First, paragraph 64 deals with management letters—which, in my past auditing experience, I found extremely useful and helpful. I hope that my hon. Friend's Department and other Departments that receive them, as well as the members of councils, are treating them seriously. I also hope that the Departments will encourage a good, tough procedure for going through management letters, as they are valuable in ensuring efficiency and effectiveness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The audit opinions and the standard audit reports that are mentioned leave out the word "true", which is the commercial requirement. They refer solely to the fact that accounts for local authorities and other public bodies tend to be required to represent the position fairly. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0189">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
Government should reflect on whether future audit opinions should move towards the true and fair opinion required in the commercial sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my hon. Friend the Minister cannot answer immediately, perhaps he will reply to me in detail in a letter. I should be happy to accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.54 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) for his generous welcome. This is an interesting time in which to take up my job. In spite of our wide political differences, I have warm respect for the hon. Gentleman and I discovered that that was not misplaced when I visited Sheffield recently and met its civic leaders. Having already met representatives from local authorities in the north—from Barnsley, Sheffield, Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham—I know that it is possible for us all to agree on the highest standards of local authority performance in the interests of the people whom we all serve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman said the Audit Commission is a vital part of the propriety that we expect from local government. I share his wish that there should be no controversy or public dispute between us on that. He referred to paragraph 58 of the code, which makes it clear that it is for the auditor to decide whether, in a particular case, he should make a report in the public interest. The code lists some circumstances that may call for a report, and uses the term "if signficant". I am sure that the auditors will use their discretion when deciding how to use their powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman spoke of unnecessary criticism of local government—a system which, he said, had a quality unequalled in the rest of the world. The best of our local authorities are, indeed, unrivalled in the rest of the world, as I know from my experience as a Member of Parliament and my dealings with authorities during recent weeks. I often feel sad that local authorities are sometimes condemned by Members of Parliament for decisions with which we disagree. The quality of the officials working in local government is often extremely high, and I am quick to pay tribute to them—for example, ther are people working in housing departments, who have unparalleled experience. However, a problem exists with career structures in local government, with the status of local government officers, and so on. I shall consider such matters, and there is no difference between the hon. Gentleman and I on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to reports in the press at the end of last week about his alleged remarks. The Independent said that he had attacked the Commission's
	<br><blockquote><p>"single-minded concentration on local authority accounting at the expense of effectiveness and quality".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
I draw the Committee's attention to paragraph 12 of the code, which is headed "Professional Care." I read the draft code carefully, and paragraph 12 with satisfaction—especially subparagraph (f) which recommends that the auditor keeps
	<br><blockquote><p>"Up to date with developments in professional matters"</p></blockquote>
and subparagraph (g), which recommends that he ensures
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the audit is staffed with sufficient suitably qualified and experienced personnel and that the work of the staff is properly reviewed."</p></blockquote>
I was pleased to read in section 13—"Audit Objectives"—that under subparagraph (e) the commission should be concerned with
	<br><blockquote><p>"the performance of particular services"</p></blockquote>
and that under subparagraph (I), it should be concerned with
	<br><blockquote><p>"the effectiveness of management arrangements."</p></blockquote>
Under paragraph 14(d), the auditor will discharge his responsibilities by providing
	<br><blockquote><p>"where appropriate, a report dealing with matters considered by the auditor to be of public interest."</p></blockquote>
Clearly, the Audit Commission realises the need for the highest professional standards and care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dover (Mr. Shaw) drew attention to paragraph 64, which covers management letters. I assure him that they will be treated with the seriousness that they deserve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to emphasise that public sector accounts are drawn up not on the same basis as company accounts, but on the basis of presenting fairly the position of the authority. That form of words works well in the public sector. The form of accounts in the private sector is different, and I understand that the private sector is reconsidering the standard form of words for auditors' opinions. I shall seek further advice on the matter and will write to my hon. Friend about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all agree that there is always room for improvement in auditing, as with everything else. That is why the commission has returned to the Committee after only two years, when it could have waited for five years.
