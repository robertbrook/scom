	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Natural Heritage (Scotland) Bill [Lords]</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That, during consideration of the Natural Heritage (Scotland) Bill [Lords], the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.—[	<i>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I understand your difficulty with starred amendments in general, but will you take into account that only one weekend has elapsed between the Bill being discussed on Second Reading and my tabling amendments and that, naturally, I wish to talk to people in Scotland about the Bill? Would you be lenient, Mr. Martin, and possibly reconsider your decision about my amendments Nos. 43 and 44 that deal with archaeology? I had to discuss the matter over the weekend, and Monday morning was the first opportunity that I had to table the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have an announcement to make about starred amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I intend to table a new clause on national parks later in our proceedings, especially with regard to Loch Lomond. Am I correct in believing that it is the custom for new clauses to be debated at the end of our deliberations? A report published by the Countryside Commission will be on the Secretary of State's desk within the next few days, and I want the utmost information to be made available to us so that we can debate the issue properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the order of consideration motion as set out on the amendment paper is passed by the Committee, the hon. Member must accept that decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian Wilson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cunninghame, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I refer to the spirit in which we intend to approach the Bill; I do not wish to debate the sittings motion. Our aim is to have as many short debates as possible. Opposition Members will not attempt to delay our proceedings or do anything other than facilitate our work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have two announcements that may help the Committee. Before I call the order of consideration motion, I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill, copies of which are available in the Room. I also draw to the Committee's attention that Members should give adequate notice of their intention to table amendments. As a general rule, I do not intend to call starred amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Bill be considered in the following order, Clause 1, Schedule 1, Clauses 2 to 4, Schedule 2, Clauses 5 to 12, Schedule 3, Clause 13, Schedule 4, new Clauses and new Schedules relating to Part I, Clause 14, Schedule 5, Clauses 15 and 16, Schedule 6, Clauses 17 and 18, new Clauses and new Schedules relating to Part II, Clause 19, Schedules 7 to 9, Clauses 20 and 21, new Clauses and new Schedules relating to Part III, Clauses 22 to 26, Schedules 10 and 11, Clause 27, remaining new Clauses and new Schedules.</p></blockquote>
I wish to say a few words about the enabling motion. The order in which we are proposing to consider the Bill seems to me much the most logical one, given the lay-out of the Bill. It is usual to consider schedules after the clauses to which they relate, as that makes for a much more coherent order of discussion. It is simply an extension of that principle to suggest discussing new clauses and schedules relating to each part of the Bill immediately after completing discussion of that part. That applies particularly to new clauses and schedules connected with part I because, without the enabling motion, it could be some considerable time after discussing part I before we discussed the new clauses and schedules pertaining to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I remind the Minister about the new clause relating to Loch Lomond? I understand that the Countryside Commission will produce conclusions that will be on the Secretary of State's desk in the next few days. Will those conclusions be made public, so that we can discuss the issue as fully as possible?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall do our best. I do not envisage that we shall get beyond the debate on national parks this morning—amendment No. 2 to clause 2 deals with that issue. Some new clauses may not conform to the running order because of the groupings. The case that the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) has in mind may be a case in point. Such new clauses could, therefore, be considered earlier or later. However, that does not negate the principal of the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept entirely the common sense of the Minister's comments about how to proceed, subject to the caveat of my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall). Clearly, it would be unsatifactory for our debates in Committee to be followed by the publication of documents and Government responses pertinent to those debates. In the spirit of the Minister's comments, we accept this as a logical way to proceed. I hope that the Minister will, in turn, accept what I stipulated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the bill be considered in the following order, Clause 1, Schedule 1, Clauses 2 to 4, Schedule 2, Clauses 5 to 12, Schedule 3, Clause 13, Schedule 4, new Clauses and new Schedules relating to Part I, Clause 14, Schedule 5, Clauses 15 and 16, Schedule 6, Clauses 17 and 18, new Clauses and new Schedules relating to Part II, Clause 19, Schedules 7 to 9, Clauses 20 and 21, new Clauses and new Schedules relating to Part III, Clauses 22 to 26, Schedules 10 and 11, Clause 27, remaining new Clauses and new Schedules.—[	<i>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>SCOTTISH NATURAL HERITAGE</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 25, in page 1, line 9, after "SNH)", insert "or Dualchas Nàduir Alba.".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take the following: amendment No. 32, in page 1, line 9, after "SNH)", insert "or Oighreachd Nadara na h-Alba."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>New clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>USE OF GAELIC NAME</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>"SNH shall have a duty in all its dealings with other persons or bodies to use also the Gaelic form of its name (as set out in section 1(1) of this Act) wherever it uses the English form.".</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The principle is simple and important. The amendment would give the new organisation a Gaelic title. If it were being set up in Wales, such a bilingual approach would be automatic. It would be especially appropriate for this agency to set such a precedent in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Ray Michie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll and Bute)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, because the hon. Gentleman has not got far with his proposition. I should like the hon. Gentleman to clear up the spelling in amendments Nos. 25 and 32. The word "Dualchas" in amendment No. 25 should be spelt Dualachas. The word "Nadara" in amendment No. 32 should be spelt Nadurra. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) is not present, as he may have confirmed that. I hope that my spelling is correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should hate to think that the hon. Lady has reinforced a caricature of the Gaels as having a talent for nitpicking division, rather than for agreeing on broad and important principles. I do not want to speak to amendment No. 32 and I assume that my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) has transport difficulties somewhere between here and the Western Isles. Given his absence, perhaps the amendment could be withdrawn. Gaelic spelling and terminology is the subject of interminable debate, as the hon. Lady knows, but the spelling in amendment No. 25 is the spelling that I have and I shall stay with it. It is far more important that we should agree on the principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and Kinross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading I said that I wanted to make the Bill a rural scotland (miscellaneous provisions) Bill, but I am not prepared to start yet. The hon. Lady said that it would be inappropriate to give a Gaelic name to a body for the whole of Scotland and that that would be suitable only for its activities in the north-west. I reject that. Gaelic is the national language of Scotland. The greatest number of Gaelic speakers live in the lowlands. I reject the idea of pushing Gaelic into the far north-west corner of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whether or not Gaelic is a national language—I adore it as a romantic language—more people in Scotland speak Polish as their first language than Gaelic. The hon. Gentleman should simply say Oidhche mhath and ask the hon. Lady to spell it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that typically helpful remark. The difference is that there are even more Polish speakers in Poland. The distinguishing feature of Gaelic is that it is an indigenous language. If it is not given status in Scotland, it is unlikely to be given status in Poland or anywhere else. That is significant because the areas of Scotland that are predominantly Gaelic-speaking are those where the new agency will be most active. It is an unfortunate truth that those areas have not shown conspicuous sensitivity to the agency's predecessors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be symbolic and worthwhile if the new agency, which will be setting off on the right foot in many other ways, could demonstrate empathy and respect for the people of those areas and all that they hold dear by adopting a Gaelic title. That would impose no burden or expense, but would put down a marker that the agency could deal with the people of that area in their language. Such bodies have sometimes paid insufficient regard to the culture and values of the area in which they operate. If the principle is accepted, I would be happy to work with the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs Michie) in leading Gaelic scholars to sort out the semantics, but if the idea is not accepted, I shall press the amendment to a Division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 1, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles, is a brief extension of the same principle and would provide that Scottish National Heritage:
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall have a duty in all its dealings with other persons or bodies to use also the Gaelic form of its name".</p></blockquote>
That means that the stationery of the new body should show a biligual title. Many organisations, not impelled to do so by legislation, manage to do that. For instance, the banks are good at using alternative Gaelic titles. They operate under commercial pressures rather than purely cultural pressures. I see no difficulty in a Government Department doing that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I freely acknowledge that the Scottish Office has done useful work for Gaelic over the past few years. There is still much progress to be made on the official status of the language. People whose first language is Gaelic should have the right to communicate with Government agencies in that language. It is a small representation of that principle that Government agencies should show themselves able and willing to communicate in Gaelic.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the 1983 election, I had a constituency that was part highland Perthshire and substantially part lowland Scotland. It was interesting to me, because of my keen and active interest in the well-being of the language, to realise that the lowland part of my constituency had no interest in Gaelic. Indeed, on occasions there were elements of hostility when attempts were made to make lowland schools teach the language. I took the view that that was not constructive or helpful. I wanted the schools that taught the language to continue to do so and I did not want it to become a political issue. In the lowland part of my constituency, there was not only opposition, but hostility to the imposition on children of a language that people felt bore no relation to today's needs. We must move with caution on such issues. Although I represent a substantially highland constituency, which would support moves to encourage the use of the language, I cannot forget my earlier experiences of representing part of the lowlands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember the private Member's Bill that was introduced by the then right hon. Member for Western Isles. He was astonished and surprised when I, as a supporter of the language, had to speak against the Bill because of the attitudes of the people in the Carse of Gowrie who were totally opposed to the inclusion of the language in the school curriculum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we accept the amendment, we would include in the Bill a language that is alien to the majority of the Scots. I am sorry to say that, but we must face the fact that the majority of Scots neither speak, nor understand the language and that many of them have no historical connections with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will give way to the hon. Gentleman. I speak as a supporter of the language. I am deeply concerned that we should do nothing that could cause offence or lead people who may not be as tolerant as most of us hope we are to see this as a means of attacking the Westminster Parliament. We must consider the matter fully and carefully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept at face value the hon. Gentleman's self-definition as a supporter of the language, but some of us have rather different recollections of what happened exactly 10 years ago last week, when Donald Stewart's Bill was killed off. I invite the hon. Gentleman to reconsider his remark that the language is "alien" to the great majority of people in Scotland. It is possible for a great majority of people not to speak Gaelic, without feeling that it is alien to them. the attitude that we hear from the hon. Gentleman and from the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir Nicholas Fairbairn) will create alienation and turn this into a political issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not choose the word "alien" accidentally. I chose it deliberately because of my experience 10 years ago. If the hon. Gentleman has never had such an experience, I understand his view. The whole of Perthshire was designated in that Bill, which showed complete ignorance of the fact that all of Perthshire had never been part of the old crofting lands of Scotland. Such insensitivity caused me deep concern at that time. Since then, in many meetings and discussions and while actively participating in the promotion of the language, I have tried to convince those who want the language to prosper in Scotland that they should move delicately and carefully. They must avoid entering into statute matters that could give offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee can help the language in many ways. Some of us have done so recently. I accept that this is not a party matter—hon. Members on all sides of the House have been active. We have managed to persuade the Government to spend much more money on the Gaelic language in broadcasting, which is a positive step. We have achieved a fair amount in education, which is another positive step. We must avoid giving offence by insisting that we put into the Bill and in every piece of correspondence and every document from the new body a language that the majority of Scots will not understand. That could present problems, because highland Scotland is not all Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have constantly to remind people that highland Scotland wears the kilt. In lowland Scotland, where the majority of the Scottish population lives, many people have no direct historical connections with highland Scotland. Indeed, many of them have more historical connections with Ireland than with highland Scotland. That is all part of our modern Scottish society and they are all Scots. I urge caution. The matter is not as simple as it looks and could present us with difficulties. We must consider it carefully and examine the case for and against the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Ray Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should be clear what we are talking about. Some hon. Members have said that people would not understand the Gaelic title, but I do not accept that argument. Amendments Nos. 25 and 32 would not replace the name Scottish National Heritage with the Gaelic title, but would include the Gaelic title. As the hon. Member for Cunningham, North (Mr. Wilson) said, Gaelic is frequently used
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0011">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
on the letterheads of banks and district and regional councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 25 refers to "Dualchas Naduir Alba". Dualchas means hereditary disposition, Naduir means nature, and Alba is Scotland. That is not too difficult to understand. I shall discuss amendment No. 32 later. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman is not too worried about which one will be accepted. They are both offered as suggestions. I was the only one who talked about a Gaelic name during our Second Reading debate and I am delighted that that idea has won support. At the time, I confess that I had not thought about including a Gaelic title as well. I realised that if we had a Gaelic title only, it might be difficult for some people in Scotland. Some lowland Members, especially the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson), wondered why there was a fuss about sites of special scientific interest, as the only one near his constituency was somewhere on the river Tweed. That brought home the fact that the Bill has much to do with the large highland area of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong to divorce the culture and language from the natural heritage of Scotland. If we succeed in including a Gaelic title, I hope that everyone will make an effort to learn and pronounce it. There should be more of that, and not only for Gaelic names. Nothing makes me cringe more than to hear people say "lock" Lomond and Holy "lock", instead of saying "loch". Yet, they go out of their way to pronounce Dhahran with much emphasis on the middle "ch" sound, which they appear unable to say when pronouncing the word "loch".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Lady is so meticulous about the pronunciation and spelling of words, will she please spell Oidhche mhath?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Ray Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall happily spell that afterwards for the hon. and learned Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is general anglicisation of Scottish names. People talk of the Spey valley instead of Strathspey or the Tweed valley instead of Tweeddale. To dance a "Strathvalley" and real sounds nonsense. It is time that we took a grip on the matter. Often Scots are far too polite, especially when they hear words such as loch wrongly pronounced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
Amendment No. 32 is interesting and I hope that the hon. Members for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) and for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) will say something about it. "Oighreachd" means heritage, whereas "Dualchas" means hereditary disposition, so perhaps amendment No. 32 is the better of the two amendments. The Gaelic title should be used as another step towards reinforcing the language. Just think of all the people who would then know at least four Gaelic words. That would be splendid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the fact that the Government have done much to encourage Gaelic broadcasting. To suggest that a Gaelic title would be political and would cause offence is astonishing. There are millions of Scottish people who have a great affection for the language. We know that it is part of our culture and heritage and should like to see its cause furthered. One way of doing so would be to include a Gaelic title in the Bill. That cannot do any harm. On the contrary, it would be widely welcomed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disturbed by the concept behind the amendment. I trust that no one is more emotional about our culture and its manifestations than I am. Gaelic is one of those manifestations, but it is a dead language. We can hear that from listening to the news, which includes words that have been invented since the 12th century, such as nuclear bomb, Gulf war and so on. Gaelic is a manifestation of culture and is a language for those who can communicate in it between themselves, just as the deaf and dumb communicate with a special language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is claimed that Gaelic is the language of Scotland, how will that affect the Scottish National party in its support for Scotland in Europe? Everything in Europe is translated into 13 different languages and printed in purple, blue, green, yellow, pink, and so on. Will every street sign be translated too, so that Princes street will also be called le strat de les princes, Prinzestraat, and so on? I shall not go through them all, but would the Gaelic translation appear at the bottom or, even, the top?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is false to imagine that we would be promoting a romantic, cultural, historical language—although it is spoken by some—by including it in everyday matters as if we were a bilingual society. The world is now essentially monolingual in English. We do not see Russians on television explaining in Russian what Mr. Gorbachev is doing. They do that in English.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do we want to indulge in the fantasy that the Irish have had for years? They have pretended that Erse is their principal language. It is not. Very few Irish people can speak it. It is not necessary for every street sign to be written in Erse as well as in English.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ian Noble committed an act of madness when he stated that every sign on Skye should be written in Gaelic, which no one can understand. Indeed, a serious road accident occurred there the other day because people could not understand a sign. My cousin, God bless her, was seriously injured in that accident. We may as well make bagpipes compulsory. I say that as president of the Dysart and Dundonald pipe band.

I adore Gaelic and I adore its concept. I speak some Gaelic. I bet that I speak more Gaelic than the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs Michie), who had difficulty even spelling it. You were good enough, Mr. Martin, to save her from having to spell Oidhche mhath, which is the simplest of Gaelic phrases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Ray Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman is doing a great disservice to Ian Noble who has done a tremendous amount in Skye for the Gaelic language. Does the hon. and learned Gentleman know that the European Community, in general, is far more supportive of minority languages than this and other countries? We look to the EC to continue that support. Perhaps he was not aware of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am well aware that that is nonsense. I said that in English. If the hon. Lady could ask me that question in Gaelic, I would be surprised. I would be even more surprised if she could ask me it in Basque. I can probably speak more minority European languages than she can. I am very unimpressed by her argument. When was the last contract between countries written in Gaelic? Whom was it between and for what reason? I should be interested if the hon. Lady can answer that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a matter of culture and romance, the language should be allowed to flourish, but to pretend that it is a common language in Scotland is a fallacy, which should not be encouraged, especially as the European Community is not absolutely clear about in which language it should speak, in which capital its Parliament should sit and so on. Gaelic is a flourishing culture, but it is not a contemporary language that everyone speaks or in which people especially wish to communicate. The great thing about those who speak it is that they will never do so in front of a person who does not understand it. That is good manners and it underlies the excellence of the Gaelic people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have heard a series of flimsy excuses from Conservative Members about why they will vote against the amendment. Clearly, the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir Nicholas Fairbairn) regards the Gaelic language as something that should be consigned to a museum. He considers that Polish road signs would be more appropriate in Stornoway than Gaelic road signs. I do not agree with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) talked about Gaelic being an "alien" language. He and the hon. and learned Gentleman are creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. Of course, Gaelic is not understood by the majority of Scots and may seem alien if it is never used. It is no accident that Gaelic is not used. It is no accident that it is not the language of the majority, even in the highlands. It was deliberately put down and destroyed by Government action. The amendment is a small sign to the Government to reverse that attack on the Gaelic language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the amendment. It would make a small, but important contribution to the future of the Gaelic
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
language. It would provide slightly greater status and functionality for one of Scotland's two national languages and one of our three spoken languages. It would not revive Gaelic, but it might be one step towards halting its decline. The amendments would certainly bring those few words into everyday use. Language is functional: either it is used and is therefore useful, or it dies. That is precisely what the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not give way. That is precisely what the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross has proved by his attitude to the language. He equates it with deaf and dumb language, and that is what will happen to Gaelic if the Government treat it in that fashion. The automatic inclusion of those Gaelic words in the title, letterheadings, hoardings and advertisements of the Scottish National Heritage will assist that language. Only by appropriate, everyday use can Gaelic be restored. It needs to be used on road signs, street signs, in business headings and so on. When, on entering Caithness, one sees the words "Failte an Caithness", one can understand what the Gaelic words mean because they are functional. The same would apply to banks, street names and the title of the new institution proposed in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government are prepared to spend reasonable sums of money on promoting the Gaelic language on television and if they are serious about promoting Gaelic, it would cost little more, if anything, to take that small step. Gaelic needs assistance if it is to thrive and grow. Despite all that the hon. and learned. Gentleman said, Gaelic is one of the oldest Indo-European languages and it deserves that support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will support the amendment. The excuses that we have heard from the Conservative Benches for doing nothing to help Gaelic and for being prepared to hinder its use are shameful and disgraceful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Unfortunately, it will get headlines such as, "Gaelic is a dead language says Fairbairn". That helps no one. If he thinks that Gaelic is a dead language, he should go to Barrowland when Runrig is playing and jump up and down—an unlikely concept, but not inconceivable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs Michie) picked on a pedantic point, which I have checked. The spelling on the amendment paper is correct. The hon. Lady may be confused by the fact that the word "Dualchas" has a svarabhakti vowel, one which is heard, but not spelt after the "1". Even by that reasoning, the position of the "a" before the "1" in the spelt version is correct. Let us leave it at that. It is hardly worth arguing about.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not disagree with any of that, but is this modest amendment capable of giving offence? I would say that it is incapable of giving offence to anyone, with the somewhat variable exception of the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross. It is a small point to concede.

The hon. Member for Tayside, North has said that this matter is not as simple as it looks. I ask him and other Conservative Members to take my word for it that it is that simple. The only way that Gaelic can become a divisive political issue is by playing into the hands of those who would like to make it such an issue and annexe it for a certain political view. I do not want that and I am sure that most Conservative Members do not want that.

I am sympathetic to the purpose behind the amendments. I wish to consider whether it is appropriate to have such Gaelic references and, if so, whether it would be necessary to repeat them on every occasion that the English words appear. As my hon.

As Scottish Natural Heritage will operate throughout Scotland, its sphere will include those areas in which Gaelic speakers are most numerous, especially in the highlands and islands. I hope and expect that SNH will do much good work in that area to establish and develop existing links with local communities. I cannot stress too much how important it is for SNH to have as much support as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0014">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
possible from the local people with whom it will wish to work. To that end, it may prove useful for it to operate under its name in Gaelic in the relevant areas. I stress the importance of the word "relevant". I am sure that SNH will also continue the practice of the Nature Conservancy Council in producing Gaelic language brochures and posters, where appropriate. Certainly, the joint promotion of Gaelic posters by NCC and Acair launched in Skye last autumn has proved successful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

To enforce the use of the Gaelic name for SNH, as proposed by the new clause, is somewhat excessive. It is right and proper that SNH should be mindful of its relationship with Gaelic speakers and of their needs. As a result it will, where practical and appropriate, no doubt use the Gaelic name. However, to impose a statutory requirement on it to do so in all circumstances and regardless of whether the person addressed is a Gaelic speaker is a little heavy handed and is not the best approach to such an issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am reliably informed by those whose knowledge of Gaelic is considerably greater than mine that the words in amendment No. 32 represent a good translation into Gaelic of "Scottish Natural Heritage", especially as it encapsulates that concept of land in relation to our natural heritage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs Michie) asked me to comment on the translations. I am concerned that it seems possible to choose between the two Gaelic names for Scottish Natural Heritage. The one in amendment No. 25 has the particular drawback that it produces the acronym DNA, which could cause confusion. People might be given the impression that Scottish Natural Heritage was to be run by genetic engineers. That is not the intention of any of us. Moreover, amendment No. 25 contains a literal translation and is not as opposite as the wording in amendment No. 32, which encapsulates better the concept of land in relation to the natural heritage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Members for enlightening the Committee on how the Gaelic language can tackle the subject. Nevertheless, I believe that it is for those who work in SNH to decide whether and in what circumstances to use a Gaelic name for the new body, as they will be best placed to understand both the language and the concepts involved. No doubt, they will be grateful to those who moved the amendments for their suggestions on the appropriate Gaelic name. I shall consider the matter further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that SNH should establish its own identity, which can be readily understood by all those with whom it has to operate. I feel that that might be best done by giving it a Gaelic, as well as an English, name. As I have mentioned, we shall have to consider the legal consequences of that and how much of the Bill would have to be amended as a result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's remarks have been helpful and constructive. It is a pity that his hon. and learned Friend the Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir Nicholas Fairbairn) did not hear them, because he would have been driven apoplectic by the Under-Secretary's conciliatory tone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of what the Under-Secretary said, I shall not press the new clause in the name of the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald), but to test the Committee's feelings on the principle of including the Gaelic name in the Bill, I shall press amendment No. 25 to a vote. Much thought went into that version of the Gaelic name. Its arbiter was a gentleman who has been appointed by the Secretary of State to the north-west regional board of SNH. That is no secret. The use of the word "Dualchas" is meant to introduce a sense of inheritance, which is missing from the alternative name.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Is it your judgment, Mr. Martin, that the issues would be best dealt with on Report, or when we discuss clause 3? I should like to introduce into this Bill the concept that is contained in section 17(1)(c) of the Agriculture Act 1986. I put down that marker for the Scottish Office, and seek guidance on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not for me to advise the hon. Gentleman. Indeed, I should probably have to ask him for such advice. I shall leave it at that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although there are similarities between the amendments, they have been tabled for different reasons. Amendment No. 22 would delineate more specifically the functions and aims of SNH. Several bodies have gained the wrong impression that SNH is the Nature Conservancy Council renamed, not an amalgamation of the NCC and the Countryside Commission. That fear has been expressed by several bodies which have made representations to me. That fear is misplaced, but the problem would be dealt with if the Bill contained a more specific undertaking that one of the aims of SNH was to facilitate the enjoyment of and access to the countryside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Page 6 of "The Way Ahead" states that the purpose of the new body would be to
	<br><blockquote><p>"increase enjoyment of the countryside and safeguard access to it."</p></blockquote>
Such a provision is not contained in clause 1 but it would be beneficial if it were.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) has tabled a starred amendment that would remove Clause 1(1)(b). There is always a contradiction between access to the countryside and conservation, although one cannot exist without the other. One cannot enjoy the countryside or appreciate what has been conserved unless there is access to it. Of course, there is a danger that access will detract from the natural heritage of an area. However, part of the reason for conservation is the enjoyment of what is being conserved. If access is not facialitated, the purpose of conserving an area is largely defeated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The conflict about a National Trust property in Glencoe has arisen again recently. The issue is about access over the river Coe and the bridges into Coire Gabhail—the lost valley—and Coire nan Lochan. That conflict has run for many years. It has been argued that everything should be retained in sterilised form. I do not share that view. No one who has
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
forded the river Coe in the middle of winter and had to break ice while water poured into his boots would want to return to the days before the bridges existed. Access has benefited everyone greatly. To ensure that such limited, though beneficial, access cannot be prevented by campaigns or other means in future, it is important to include our proposal in the Bill. There are conflicts in such matters and SNH must try to resolve them. While carrying out its function of conservation, SNH must not neglect its function of allowing access to the mountains and countryside for the enjoyment and benefit of everyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 7 is slightly different in that it covers the principle and some of the practicalities in gaining access to the countryside. I must make it clear that in all my years of enjoying the countryside and the mountains, I have never been refused access. My access has often been restricted during stalking seasons, but it has always been fairly easy to get advice from the keeper about where I might climb on that day. There have been increasing problems, especially in the past few years, and in places such as Kintail where the landowner is threatening to restrict access because it is his land and he does not believe that anyone else should enjoy it. The amendment would ensure that anyone who wanted to restrict access to the land must inform SNH, which would consult and then advise the Secretary of State. That would prevent problems arising in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that trespass is not a criminal, but a civil offence in Scotland. Trespass itself is not an offence—it must be shown that the trespasser has damaged the land. SNH must consider the matter of access to the land as more of it is being covered by forestry and other parts are in private hands. The rather benign stance of landowners in the past cannot be guaranteed in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I like the quote from the noble Lord Thurso—a great friend of my hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson). I agreed with Lord Thurso—much to the chagrin of my hon. Friend—when he said—
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am perfectly content with the Scots law of trespass which is that you can walk across my land but you can't stop and use it. Everybody has a right of passage, but only the owner has a right of use. This approach suits me perfectly well. It works very well and always has done."</p></blockquote>
Access by the right of tradition has served me and everyone else well in the past. It is under threat, so SNH must consider the matter and I should be grateful for the Minister's views on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to discuss access. We are fortunate in Scotland in having thousands of square miles of what can best be described as wilderness areas. Those areas sustain a substantial population in different ways. We have shepherds and their sheep, ghillies on the rivers and all those employed in the shooting practices on the moors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parts of my constituency are very beautiful and lovely to walk round, but there are times of the year when it is unwise to wander around unaware of other activities that are taking place. For example, it is neither wise nor clever to wander round aimlessly when shooting is taking place on the moors. That is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0016">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
equally true when deer stalking is taking place. When we consider access, it is important to recognise that Scotland's mountain areas provide a livelihood for a substantial number of people. We must not forget that access calls for a degree of responsibility. I like the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"to foster understanding and facilitate the enjoyment of".</p></blockquote>
There are those who wander round saying that it is their right to do so, but in everything that we do, rights bring responsibilities. The needs and livelihoods of others must be considered. Those who protect the natural heritage are those who live and work the land. The best form of conservation is to encourage those who work and live on the land and those who make use of it for the benefit of others, such as the people involved in the huge leisure and recreation industry. I support leisure and recreation and do not oppose it, but there must be a balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under amendment No. 7, SNH would have to consult, but that is not an issue when someone is found wandering round an area in which he should have known shooting was taking place. That is the important point. When encouraging conservation, we encourage access and the growth of leisure activities. With all that comes responsibility and accountability. I am worried that amendment No. 7 would have the opposite of the desired affect, which would be most unwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I go along with the sensitive and well-informed speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) who knows a great deal about the matter. There is a problem and I have various questions to ask the Scottish Office, against the background of000 our experiences and all that has been written by those who love the Scottish countryside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer the Minister to the brief from the Scottish Council for National Parks. We shall come to the case for national parks later, but the brief refers to access. Under the paragraph headed "Visitors" on the second page, it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The numbers of people walking and climbing in the mountains are increasing rapidly."</p></blockquote>
Good for them. It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is urgent need for increased investment for negotiated access agreements, for strengthened footpaths and for screened car parks."</p></blockquote>
Does the Scottish Office intend to make money available for screened car parks, especially, but also for footpaths and negotiated access agreements? The document continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is also necessary to define 'wild' areas where, for the benefit of landscape and wildlife, access will not be made easier."</p></blockquote>
Does the Scottish Office go along with that, especially in light of the experience of the National Trust on Ben Lawers, to give just one example? There is a problem, especially the erosion of well-trodden mountain paths. Will the Minister comment on that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to development, the Scottish Council for National Parks said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Firm planning control is needed to prevent unsuitable development, ugly building, misuse of sea and loch shore and bad road construction."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
Forgive me for referring to the constituency of Linlithgow, but it has experienced enormous trouble with planning permissions on the north side of Linlithgow loch—as the relevant Scottish Office officials are aware. Great resentment has been shown by the "Black Bitches"—the honoured term for the citizens of Linlithgow—because their traditional access to the north side of the loch is being denied by planning permissions for new housing developments. I am not referring to a hypothetical matter. When access is involved, firm planning control is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The council's view is that
	<br><blockquote><p>"A park organisation can bring a higher level of resources and can also introduce much needed but appropriate economic initiatives for the benefit of local people whose interests must be protected."</p></blockquote>
Whenever it is convenient, will the Scottish Office give its opinion on that view? I lay down that marker.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the issue of land, the council says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Much mountain landscape is degraded due to over-grazing by sheep and deer."</p></blockquote>
Each time I go near the relations of my hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) in the highlands for a political meeting, I put my political hoof in it—as I did about loch Maree, for which my hon. Friend must forgive me. None the less, over-grazing is a problem. The Scottish Council for National Parks certainly considers that it is. It goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Botanical variety is reduced and natural woodlands have difficulty in regenerating."</p></blockquote>
That is true. It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The type of financial support for agriculture which contributed to over-grazing in the past is now likely to be progressively replaced by more environmentally sensitive grants; but to achieve recovery of the natural diversity, including woodlands within a reasonable timescale will require investment and a planned approach."</p></blockquote>
Does the Minister agree with that? Does he consider that the council has made a substantive point, or does he believe that the matter should be seen in perspective and that the council is putting too much emphasis on it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The council considers that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Commercial afforestation of the uplands has been an expanding element and has been frequently criticised for its intrusive impact. Woodlands with a greater proportion of native species should be a consequence of the newly introduced forestry strategies, a technique practised for years in the English and Welsh national parks which as a consequence have suffered much less damage from ill-advised afforestation."</p></blockquote>
I put a question mark against that last statement as it could be argued that such afforestation varies from national park to national park in England, and that not all the English national parks have done better than we have. Nevertheless, those are the council's views and now is the right time to ask the Scottish office to comment on them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Ray Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with amendment No. 22, which deals with access.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have become conscious, especially over the past five or six years, of people who have bought estates or farms in the highlands. Sometimes they continue
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0017">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
to farm that land but, more often than not, they de-stock the farms and turn them into holiday development areas. Signs have suddenly appeared all over the place saying, "Keep out—private property". Barbed wire fences have even been put up. That is deeply resented by local people who for years have walked in a particular area with their families and now suddenly find that their way is barred. Therefore I have some sympathy with amendment No. 22.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am puzzled about amendment No. 7. Perhaps the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) can explain why he chose the figure of 50 acres. We have spoken mainly about mountain areas, but the amendments pertain to farming and crofting land. We must be sensitive to the needs of farmers and crofters. I recently received a letter from a farmer who was incensed to find that a walk over his farm had been advertised at the local tourist office without his knowledge or consent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The farmer says in his letter that a brochure for visitors
	<br><blockquote><p>"shows a route through my improved pasture land for a ridge walk."</p></blockquote>
He objects in the stongest terms because he did not give his permission for any such walk over his land. He says that the particular piece of land is used by a neighbouring crofter, with his permission, to graze sheep and cattle. Soon it will be the lambing season for the sheep on the hill pasture, and his experience is that during lambing the sheep are disconcerted by people and their dogs, even if the dogs are on a lead. He states,
	<br><blockquote><p>"The spectre of single, or groups of people … walking over the pasture during lambing does not bear thinking about."</p></blockquote>
He wants to make it clear that
	<br><blockquote><p>"this is a working farm, not a recreation ground for the general public. The pasture has had several hundreds of pounds invested to improve the quality and quantity of grass."</p></blockquote>
He is extremely worried. the water supply comes from two natural springs which serve the farms steading buildings and the farmhouse, and any pollution or damage to the water supply would be disastrous for his farm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw this case to the Committee's attention. We must be careful that we do not invite all and sundry to walk over any farmland and croftland that they choose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Paice 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cambridgeshire, South-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I venture with some trepidation into what hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, there is no point in my giving way. Many people from Europe and other parts of the world spend time in Scotland and the matter concerns them. I often visit Scotland and thoroughly enjoy it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) moved the amendments in a moderate and sensitive manner that would encourage support. My approach is coloured, however, by the
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
knowledge that it is Labour party policy to legislate to provide access to all uncultivated land throughout the United Kingdom. Although we are presented with a moderate and sensitive suggestion, we should recognise that the policy behind it would have dire consequences throughout the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am the first to accept that Scottish law on trespass is different—it is fair to say that it is better than the law within England and Wales—but there are certain issues about access that must be recognised. The hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell), with his wide knowledge, has properly identified a number of them, such as the disturbance of wildlife, erosion of footpaths and possible damage to flora and fauna, although that can be done by not only tourists, but livestock. If we were to accept the amendment, we would lose the ability to control access, which is the only way in which to counteract and prevent such problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to encourage people to develop properly constructed footpaths that withstand erosion caused by climbers and walkers, we should have some means of controlling access to the rest of the moorland, forest or whatever the countryside might be, because unrestricted access would mean that people could wander at will. We should encourage them, through some form of restriction, to use properly constructed pathways, of which there will be more and more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs Michie) has referred to some important issues. As someone who has spent all his life in the country, I have absolutely no time for those who seek to bar people's access to their property with barbed wire fences and notices, which often have no legal standing. However, I respect their right to do so. Legislation is not the way in which to deal with that problem; such landowners should be encouraged to allow access.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I run the risk of discussing the reform of the common agricultural policy, but there is no doubt that environmental questions will be much more closely linked with agricultural support in the future. I suspect that problems of access will be discussed in that context. It is important to encourage SNH to do whatever it can to build bridges between those landowners who seek physically to restrict access and others who want greater access. To do so in the manner suggested by amendment No. 7 would be a retrograde step, as the damage that could be done would far outweigh the benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because the majority of the population are several generations removed from our common rural ancestry they are ignorant of the ways of the countryside. The hon. Member for Argyll and Bute mentioned damage that is done at lambing time, but at other times livestock is at risk from the public's ignorance, rather than their maliciousness. We have to protect the countryside from people who do not fully understand it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot agree to any amendment that would allow access to the extent that it removed methods of guiding the public, who rightly and understandably want to use the countryside for recreation. To give the public such a blanket right as the amendment would do, and which is in the Labour party's
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0018">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
manifesto, would be wrong and detrimental to the countryside that we all seek to protect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to clarify a number of points before the Minister responds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The remarks made by the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs Michie) are valid and apply to the whole of Scotland, although many of the problems tend to occur in the highlands and islands. However, there is no way that a body such as SNH would seek to facilitate access to a farmer's land, nor would we want that. I am keen to ensure only that access is a facility at the disposal of SNH in its stated aims of developing the countryside, the natural habitat, the environment and the enjoyment of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At one time I was a great elitist in my attitude to the countryside and the mountains. I bitterly opposed the bridges over the Coe—I waded the burns and wanted them all to be reserved for me alone. For many years after the bridges were built I refused to use them, but having got my feet wet and cold so many times, I now use them and they are wonderful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not propose that great tracts should be opened up or that there should be general access to Knoydart. We are dealing with areas to which people already have access and trying, on their behalf, to make access easier. Before farmers in my constituency write to me, I should make it clear that there is no question of opening up agricultural land in Strathkelvin and Bearsden. They have enough trouble with wee boys from Kirkintilloch running over their fields—they do not need people tramping over them down to the Kelvin. The hon. Lady made a valid point, but that is not our aim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a great conflict between access and preservation of the natural heritage. That is a problem that SNH will have to deal with. It cannot always be solved by legislation, and balance must be maintained. SNH must use sensitively and properly the powers that we give it, and it will be accountable to the Government and Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important debate on a significant subject. I shall deal first with some of the questions that were raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) was correct in his statement about the law. In Scots laws, trespass is a civil, not a criminal, matter. My hon. Friends the Members for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) and for Cambridgeshire, South-East (Mr. Paice) and the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) all made relevant speeches about the pressure caused by visitors to certain areas. For example, during the lambing season farmers do not welcome walkers with dogs, in case that leads to sheep worrying. However, under the Dogs (Protection of Livestock) Act 1953, it is an offence to allow dogs to chase, attack or worry sheep. So laws are there when matters go wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Linlithgow asked whether more investment would be needed to deal with
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
increased numbers of walkers. I agree that the number of visitors using the mountain areas of Scotland for recreation is steadily increasing. Government support through the Countryside Commission for Scotland has helped to identify the extent of the resulting problems of erosion caused by walkers and other users and how best the problems can be overcome. The footpath research project has helped to focus attention on the means of repairing damage, and a number of experimental projects have been successfully implemented. For example, work has been undertaken on Ben Lawers, which the hon. Member for Linlithgow mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that pressure of visitors can cause damage, and in some areas that has undoubtedly occurred. Our wish to encourage access must be balanced against the potential damage that might result. There have been recent developments in the concept of green tourism—that is, access that is sensitive and does not degrade or damage the natural heritage. No doubt SNH would be involved in such initiatives. It will be able to negotiate access agreements with owners under clause 12 and schedule 3 of the Bill. That is an important point. I have dealt with the hon. Gentleman's point about funds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his reply about strengthened footpaths, as the issue of erosion is important. I was glad to hear about those projects. I also asked about the increased investment for negotiated access agreements. The Scottish Council for National Parks believes that that is important, as is clear both from its document and from conversations with its members. Will the Minister give undertakings about that matter? Is increased investment for the agreements part of Scottish Office policy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We believe that SNH will have an important role in helping to provide and improve access. We will have to decide its expenditure priorities within the funding provided by the Government. Naturally, we examine the bids provided each year by bodies similar to SNH and we shall carefully consider the bids that they make in relation to the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is absolutely no dispute between us about the importance of access to the natural heritage of Scotland. We part company over the need for the amendments. The Government believe that amendment No. 22 is unnecessary, as clause 1(1) already covers access. The amendment would highlight access at the expense of other aspects of SNH's purpose of facilitating enjoyment of the natural heritage. Clause 1 and the amendments to part II of the Countryside (Scotland) Act 1967 give SNH all the powers it needs in relation to access. SNH will, therefore, be able to build on and develop the valuable work done by the Countryside Commission for Scotland in this area over the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 7, the Government are keenly aware of the traditions enjoyed by generations of walkers in the Scottish countryside. As I have already said, the role of SNH in relation to those traditions is well served by the provisions of the Bill as it

	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
stands and would, if anything, be jeopardised by an amendment that introduced an element of compulsion where, traditionally, tolerance and mutual respect between recreational land users and landowners has allowed for, by and large, a harmonious relationship.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be pedantic and difficult, but the Minister spoke about SNH having all the powers that it needed. That is rather an elastic phrase. The Minister and I know from our constituencies that there are sometimes problems with planning authorities. Will the Minister comment on the powers of the new body in relation to elected planning authorities? That is a difficult interface.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are straying from the amendment. The subject under discussion is access. The question of planning authorities, and who should be on them, is not a matter for debate on this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman studies clause 2(2) he may find the information that he seeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only is the amendment redundant, as I have already explained, but it is undesirable. The concept of facilitating the enjoyment of the natural heritage covers a number of elements, including recreational pursuits, many of which require access to the countryside. To single out "access" in clause 1(1) would give greater weight to it than to the other elements of the role of SNH in facilitating the enjoyment of the natural heritage. In these I include the provision of car parking, picnic areas, the development of play areas and its support for information boards and waymarking footpaths. Those aspects of SNH's role of facilitating enjoyment are no less important that its access role. It would not, therefore, be proper to single out access over other aspects of enjoyment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that the hon. Member for Linlithgow and other hon. Members are concerned about the traditional freedom to roam in Scotland. To add a reference in clause 1(1) of the Bill to "acccess" would do nothing in relation to that concept, nor would the imposition of a duty to consult SNH on restrictions to access. If there are particular tracts of land that Scottish Natural Heritage feels should be accessible to the public, it is open to SNH to use its powers under part II of the 1967 Act to enter into a management agreement with whoever has an interest in that land, to secure access to it. If an agreement is not possible, SNH could ask the Secretary of State to confirm an access order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
SNH has all the tools it needs as regards access, both generally and in relation to specific parts of the country. Those tools are clear and easily defined. They do not suffer from the difficulties of focus and, more importantly, monitoring that beset amendment No. 7. Who, I wonder would be able to determine whether a landowner had failed to consult Scottish Natural Heritage and, indeed, whether and to what extent the landowner's proposals represented a restriction on access? I stress that there are two
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
current and important reviews into questions of access and rights of way being conducted by the Countryside Commission for Scotland and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities respectively, in conjunction with CCS. It is to the eventual results of those reviews that we should turn for information in the debate on access, rather than to amendments to the Bill. The CCS is due to report on its major review of access in 1992.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was the question that I wanted to ask.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I anticipated the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the access remit, I can assure the Committee that there can be no doubt from a legal point of view that access is covered by the expression "facilitate the enjoyment" in clause 1(1). Furthermore, schedule 3, which deals with amendments to part II of the Countryside (Scotland) Act 1967 relating to access to open country, makes it clear that Scottish Natural Heritage is a body with specific access responsibilities. Part II of the 1967 Act allows SNH to enter into access agreements or promote access orders when it believes that the public should have access to a particular tract of open country, which is defined in the Act as land consisting wholly or predominantly of mountain, moor, health, hill, woodland, cliff, foreshore and waterways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may be a bit thick about this, but may I clarify whether an application for an access order must come from a member of the public, a local authority or an organisation? Or, can SNH decide, either from what it knows or from what it reads in the press, to impose such an access order on its own initiative? Can it initiate action or does it have to wait until there is pressure from elsewhere?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the SNH can initiate action. In particular difficult situations it can make representations to the Secretary of State who, too, may initiate action. The answer is entirely correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's helpful comments, particularly for that last answer about who can initiate action. Amendment No. 7 would provide that anyone who chose to restrict access should inform SNH, which then could advise the Secretary of State. In other words, I could phone Magnus, tell him I was unhappy, and know that he would look into the matter and advise the Secretary of State. Is my understanding correct?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously the hon. Gentleman would have to make a good case. Provided that he established a good case, there would be authority to take the matter forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister. That being the case, I am willing to withdraw amendment No. 7.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not minded to withdraw amendment No. 22. I understand that "facilitate the enjoyment" will

	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
involve acquiring access to various areas. The Bill contains the words and phrases "conservation", "enhancement of", "foster understanding" and "facilitate the enjoyment of'. Those are broad terms. Access to the countryside is so important that it should be specifically mentioned in the Bill. I remind the Committee that I am not in favour of opening up vast tracts of countryside. If it came to a choice, I would always choose conservation first. That important function should be given to Scottish Natural Heritage to deal with in a sensitive manner. I wish to put that to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
sustainable development of Scotland's natural heritage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reasoning behind amendment No. 34 is that in the consultation document "Scotland's Natural Heritage: The Way Ahead", the Government stated that they had a commitment to protect the environment and to promote the sustainable management of natural resources as well as Scotland's natural heritage. When the Bill was considered in Committee in another place, Lord Strathclyde also gave such a broad commitment. He said—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is not allowed to quote from the report of proceedings in another place. He may paraphrase Lord Strathclyde's remarks if he finds that helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Lord Strathclyde said that the Government were seeking to promote the environmentally sensitive use and management of natural resources as well as Scotland's natural heritage. It is important that the Government clarify that commitment. When considering natural heritage, one can think of aspects of Scotland's natural heritage that are purely cultural and aesthetic, or have amenity, landscape or a scientific conservation value, whereas the phrase "natural resources" conjures up a much wider definition of what those resources may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 3 deals with achieving a balance between natural heritage and similar activities, such as agriculture, fisheries and forestry, which work with and seek to develop Scotland's natural resources. It is important that the concept of "sustainable development" applies not only to those aspects of Scotland's natural heritage that might usually come to mind—the cultural, aesthetic and amenity aspects—but to all of Scotland's natural resources. The amendments would ensure that the Government promote not only Scotland's natural heritage, but Scotland's natural resources. They would also ensure that sustainable development is secured of its natural heritage as well as its natural resources and all that that involves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are interesting, and I am grateful to the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) for tabling them. They illustrate his concern that the value and the concept of sustainability should be recognised. As I shall make even clearer at a later stage, when we discuss the concept and the attempts to define it, there is no quarrel between us about the importance of sustainability as a guiding principle for all our future dealings with the natural heritage of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As members of the Committee would expect, we did not introduce these legislative proposals without giving a great deal of careful thought to the words that would be included in the legislation. While that is true in general, it is especially true of the contents of clause 1, which breaks new legislative ground. A prime example of that is in the use of the word "sustainable" for the first time in legislation. One of the considerations involved in the introduction of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0021">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
that concept was the strength of the duty that should be placed on Scottish Natural Heritage, both in respect of its actions and those of others under which it must have regard to achieving the aim
	<br><blockquote><p>"of securing that anything done … to the natural heritage is undertaken in a manner which is sustainable."</p></blockquote>
The words
	<br><blockquote><p>"SNH shall have regard to the desirability of securing"</p></blockquote>
that aim strikes a proper balance between the need to include the concept in the Bill and the fact that SNH will need to operate in the real world, where there is a limit to the extent to which it can influence the actions of others. I can tell the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) that we must give SNH time to establish itself. The more it grows in authority, the more it will be able to influence the actions of others in the direction that we wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 34 seeks to relate the aims and purposes of SNH to something described as the natural resources of Scotland, which is apparently viewed by the hon. Member for Western Isles as being somehow different from the natural heritage of Scotland. As defined in subsection (3), "the natural heritage"
	<br><blockquote><p>"includes the flora and fauna … geological and physiographical features".</p></blockquote>
Physiographical features include hills, mountains and valleys. We believe that that is sufficient for defining the operations of SNH under the Bill. The amendment would add nothing to the scope of clause 1, but would merely raise confusion about the meaning of "natural heritage" in other parts of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have established the concept of "natural heritage" as a new term in legislation. We hope and expect that it will come into regular usage as a synthesis of nature and landscape conservation, and become a precise term. The term "natural resources" is a much older one, with a less precise meaning. I believe that the amendment has been moved to clarify the position of SNH with regard to sustainable activities. That will be done in our debate that we shall have later on the definition of sustainability. I hope that the hon. Member for Western Isles will not press his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is possibly the right time to bring to the attention of the Scottish Office the anxiety of the Geologists Association. Its secretary, Dr Eric Robinson writes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the past years, the Association and yourself have worried about the future of the Nature Conservancy Council following the decision to divide it into three national units. We for our part were concerned at the possible loss in continuity to their science, and the understaffing of the earth sciences; you expressed worry over the level of funding.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Recently, a new problem seems to have arisen, at least for the Scottish unit, which may have awkward consequences for conservation in general. This is the amendment which was passed when the Scotland Natural Heritage Bill went to the House of Lords."</p></blockquote>
I do not want to anticipate that, but the Geologists Association is worried about whether the new body will have powers on which the association can rely, as it did on the Nature Conservancy Council. Will the Minister comment on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Landowners and occupiers have a vital role to play in protecting prime nature conservation sites and have in the past been rightly concerned about procedures for SSSI notification. These new changes and the sensitive way in which SNH will carry out its role in this area will, we believe, meet their legitimate concerns. This decision also underlines the Government's continuing commitment to the SSSI system as the essential mechanism for ensuring the protection of areas that are unique or representative

It is important that we do not only perceive natural heritage in narrow terms of amenity, conservation or aesthetic value, but that we consider the wider concept of natural resources that should be developed in a sustainable way. I accept the Minister's comments and bearing in mind that we shall return to the matter, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment, No. 35, in page 1, line 21, after "Scotland", insert "and its coastal waters".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take the following amendments: new clause 2—	<i>Provision of advice in relation to marine fish farm licences</i>—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1)SNH shall provide advice to the Crown Estate Commissioners and local planning authorities on the location and size of proposed marine fish farms and the effects such fish farm proposals are likely to have on the natural heritage of Scotland.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(2)Where the Crown Estate Commissioners intend to grant or renew a sea-bed lease for a fish farm against the advice of SNH and of the local planning authority the matter shall be referred to the Secretary of State to be determined by him.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment No. 8, in Clause 4, page 3, line 29, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(11)SNH shall be notified of all proposed marine developments, including fish farming, and shall advise the Secretary of State on these matters.".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was advised that amendment No. 35, which would include the Scottish coastal waters in the wording of the clause, would be a sensible amendment to ensure that discussion of the marine environment, covered by new clause 2, would be within the legitimate scope of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 2 would provide the SNH with a specific duty to give advice to the Crown Estate
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
commissioners and to local authorities about proposed marine fish-farms, and would cause sea bed licences to be referred to the Secretary of State in contentious cases arising from SNH and local authorities' objections. In a sense that would be a joint veto exercised over contentious cases, at least to the extent of referral to the Secretary of State. I would have preferred to include individual vetos in the proposed new clause, so that the SNH or local authorities acting separately could ask for contentious cases to be referred to the Secretary of State, but because of the Bill's structure I could include only a local authority right of veto with that of the SNH.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will be well aware of the complaints that give rise to the proposed new clause and of the discontent that has been felt, especially in the west highlands, for many years over the lack of democratic or local community input into decisions about fish-farm development. That discontent has been felt by local communities, local authorities and environmental groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Select Committee on Agriculture took evidence on the topic, we heard from the Nature Conservancy Council that the Crown Estate commissioners had little regard to the objections put forward by the NCC to certain fish-farming sites. Its evidence showed that the Crown Estate commissioners rejected fewer than one third of those applications to which the NCC objected and cited nature conservation as a reason for rejection in only fewer than half of such cases. It is even more telling that the Crown Estates commissioners have approved six fish-farm applications, despite sustained objections from the NCC, without referring them to the advisory committee that was supposed to deal with such disputed cases. Members of the Select Committee on Agriculture—the Minister will know that I was a member of the Committee during that inquiry—from all parties felt able to describe that as a fiasco.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to hear some assurance from the Minister that he, at least, is noting both the strong discontent that is felt by all those who deal with the Crown Estate commissioners in the west highlands over fish-farming applications, and that the advisory committee has not dealt with such cases. The Government's response to the Select Committee's recommendations is felt to be woefully inadequate. Indeed, as far as I can tell, the Government took completely the line of the Crown Estate commissioners in their response to the Select Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government did so, despite the fact that the Select Committee took on board the Government's reluctance to legislate on the issue when it put forward measured, moderate suggestions for the local authority representatives on the advisory committee to have a veto. It made a suggestion that would have gone some way towards meeting the discontent and demand for local democracy from west highland communities, without necessitating legislation—it would have required only an administrative decision from the Scottish Office. The Scottish Office failed to accept that suggestion or any complaints or
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0023">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
discontent expressed by communities in the west highlands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has a reputation for listening genuinely to the requests and points of view of local communities. It is a great disappointment that the Scottish Office was unable to implement even the most moderate and reasonable of the Select Committee's suggestions. Will the Minister, even at this late stage, take into account the Select Committee's suggestions that local authorities should be given a power of veto on the advisory committee? I should prefer to go further than that and suggest that local authorities should be given developmental powers over coastal areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tabled amendment No. 35 to ensure that our discussion on marine fish farming was legitimately within the scope of the Bill. The amendment would ensure that coastal waters were included in the powers and responsibilities of the new natural heritage agency. That is important not just because of the need for a proper scrutiny of fish-farming development, but because many sensitive areas of the Scottish coastline are coming under a variety of pressures. I think especially of the Minches, lying between my constituency and the main Scottish coastline. Fish-farming is not the only problem, but there are pressures from traditional over-fishing and the prospect of mineral and oil extraction. Those pressures need to be regulated and monitored by SNH or by another body to ensure that they do not have a long-term damaging impact on the marine environment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a strong supporter of the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald). I shall make two points. The issue of fish-farms is not easy. There are two fish-farms in my constituency of Linlithgow; one run by the local authority and the other privately. The local authority should be congratulated on its initiative in setting up Beecraigs in the Bathgate hills. One problem is that the private owners believe that the local authority's inland fish-farm has certain financial advantages that are not available to it. The Scottish Office will have to deal with delicate issues when it lays down regulations to cover fish-farms as a whole in inland lochs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles knows much more than I do about the fish-farm problems on the west coast, as does, I suspect, my hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson). However, I have a particular friend, Mr. Mark Pattinson, who runs a fish-farm at Kishorn. Dare I say it, but one problem which we must consider is that of under-financed fish-farms, where operations are run on a shoestring. Such farms were often started at a time when people thought that they would find a crock of gold in fish-farming.

Fish-farming is not like that. Fish-farmers must pay for food, netting and for all types of equipment. Many fish-farmers, let us face it, operate on a financial razor edge. Although I cannot prove it, I understand that, on certain occasions because of the shortage of money to buy food for the fish, they are released from their cases and disposed of. I can
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
imagine what that does to fish that do not know that they are supposed to swim to Greenland at a certain time in their lives, so swim instead in coastal waters and eat all the sand eels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not detain the Committee now with the problem of sand eels. When Lord Sanderson, the chairman of the Conservative party in Scotland, was Minister of State at the Scottish Office, he said that my letters on sand eels were the bane of his ministerial life. Nevertheless, I should be more than curious to here the Minister explain the Scottish Office's attitude to what I consider to be highly justified and pertinent amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry Bellingham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Norfolk, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) raised an important point about fish escaping from cages. I know that we shall discuss that later, but will my hon. Friend the Minister consider those fish that escape from cages, join a migratory stream of fish swimming up river and then crossbreed with wild stock? As yet, the evidence on the progeny of those mating fish in respect of their migratory instinct is unclear. Bearing that and my interest in the subject in mind, will my hon. Friend consider the matter sympathetically when it comes to deciding whether to accept the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This matter is important. The powers of the new agency will be greatly enhanced if the Minister responds sympathetically to the amendments and the new clause tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald). If the hon. Gentleman does not respond sympathetically and if marine activity is left outside the remit of Scottish Natural Heritage, an existing anomaly will be reinforced by the Bill. Far too much of what goes on in marine waters is, in effect, subject to no democratic public control. The greater the pressures become, some of which were outlined by my hon. Friend for Western Isles, the greater effect that anomaly will have.

If someone wishes to extend his house by building on a porch, he must apply to the local authority for permission to do so. Such procedure is clear cut. However, if a multinational company wishes to deposit a fish-farm worth million of pounds, with all its implications, in the middle of a sea loch—the fish-farm is clearly indentifiable as such from the porch to which I referred—the company does not have to obtain permission to do so from the local authority. It would be none of the local authority's business. Such a project would be cooked up in a way that I shall describe later and that is entirely unsatisfactory from a community and democratic point of view. The amendment and the new clause would introduce order, participation and accountability into the process. We believe that SNH has an important part to play in that process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth considering briefly the reasons why the anomaly has developed. Why is there a magical line—a low water mark below which local authorities supposedly have no interest or influence? It goes back
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0024">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
to the Poor Law Amendment Act 1868. At that time it was inconceivable that anything below the low water mark would be of interest to local authorities. By definition, there were no rateable subjects below the low water mark. The purpose of that legislation was to levy a rate of property owners for the relief of the poor. No property owners below the low water mark, therefore no rate, therefore no legislaton. That is the legislative basis of the present position. Clearly, circumstances have changed dramatically. A great deal takes place in inland waters which is property-based, has a value, should make a contribution to local authority funds and should be subject to the democratic control of the local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Once again we are straying from the amendment. Local government finance and the amendments are not one and the same. The hon. Gentleman should restrict his remarks to the amendments and the new clause before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously I respect your ruling, Mr. Martin, and I will be careful. the new clause refers to local authorities. The principles involving SNH, as reflected in the new clause, also inpinge on the role of local authorities which will be similarly involved in making representations to the Secretary of State. However, that was by way of preamble and I am happy to move on.

Those of us who have connections with the west coast and the sea lochs there are strongly pro-fish-farming. Let me make that clear at the outset. Several thousand jobs in the north and west of Scotland depend directly on the fish-farming industry, the development of which has largely been due to public funds dating from the mid-1970s. An enormous public investment has been made in the industry. Part of the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles which I know well is an example of the importance that the industry has achieved. a fish-farm gives decently paid male employment to 22 people. If the fish-farm were taken away from that community, it would be proportionately equivalent to taking Ravenscraig away from Lanarkshire. Obviously, the numbers are smaller, but the proportionate impact would be the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is reflected all over the west coast, where in the past 15 years fish-farming has evolved into a tremendously important employer of local people. We want to maintain and develop that. No one who knows anything about it, however, believes that the evolution has been entirely satisfactory. The consequence of the way that the industry has evolved, even if it was not the intent, is that about 90 per cent. of the fish-farming industry is in the hands of two multinational companies. If two decisions were taken, it would mean the end of the industry. I have no reason to believe that such decisions will be taken, and I hope and pray that they will never be taken, but if, in the main boardrooms of Unilever and whichever company now owns Booker McConnell—I think it is the Dee corporation—the decision was taken that fish-farming was a bad investment, the industry would collapse and disappear overnight.
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
That is the tenuous reality with which people in the west highlands and islands are all too familiar. Their economic prospects are subject to decisions made far away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellingham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If Booker McConnell has an arrangement with Dee corporation, that might be preferable to Scottish interests, but I believe that it is still an independent company.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to take the hon. Gentleman's word for that. I have not the slightest doubt that he knows more about those things than I do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two large businesses control 90 per cent. of the fish-farming industry. It was not meant to develop like that. Most of us, including Conservative Members, would in the abstract say that it would be far better if the fish-farming industry was based on the Norwegian model: in other words, if a large number of small operators could make a living from one or two cages or manage a mixed economic existence with income sources other than from fish-farming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has not developed like that, principally because the Crown Estate commissioners have been vital in determining who will develop where and on what scale. Indeed, for several years in the early stages, the Crown Estate commissioners sold for a pittance the leases on whole sea lochs on the west coast of Scotland to large companies, without the people who lived there knowing about it. The first that they knew was when development began. From any political standpoint, it is not right that a quango can reach a conclusion, in secret negotiations with companies large or small and in such a way that the people most directly affected, who have rights of heredity and who for generations have had an interest in the area's potential economic development, do not know what is going on. That is what happened in the fish-farming industry in the early years of its existence. For that reason huge areas of the west coast are now under the aegis of those companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will recollect the whole history, involving not least a former Minister of State at the Scottish Office, Lord Mansfield, and his connection with the Crown Estate commissioners. I suggest that on Thursday the Minister explains something of the relationship that he envisages between the Crown Estate commissioners and the new body. As my hon. Friend says, the role of the Crown Estate commissioners is vital.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Indeed, we are setting the scene for further debate on the subject on Thursday. There must be a relationship between the Crown Estate commissioners and the new body. I stress again that I am pro-fish-farming. I am wholly unimpressed by those who find the sight of fish-farm cages a blight upon the landscape. When I see fish-farm cages in a west highland loch, I see economic activity. I see employment where employment probably did not previously exist. No one can deny that there are environmental consequences. Fish-farming should not be the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0025">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
exclusive domain of the Crown Estate commissioners and developers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some lip service has been paid in recent years to a consultative role for local authorities. As my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles made clear, it is lip service only, and not anything of substance. Lip service is paid to consulting the Nature Conservancy Council for Scotland. Will that continue under the new agency? Will the Crown Estate commissioners be the dominant force in determining where and on what scale fish-farming will be developed? We shall seek answers to that question on Thursday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments and the new clause propose a structure that would bring in other legitimate
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
interests, including the new natural heritage agency. If the Minister can propose a different or a better structure, we shall be delighted. Simply to say that things are to go on as before and that that void is to remain would be unacceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Although the debate will be dominated by the fish-farming issue, other marine activities have a severe environmental impact.</p>
