	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Industry and Consumer Affairs (Mr. Edward Leigh)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Companies House Trading Fund Order 1991.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the agreement of the Committee, it will be convenient to discuss at the same time the draft Patent Office Trading Fund Order 1991.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we consider the orders in detail, I draw the Committee's attention to the report from the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments which has arisen because the Finance Bill makes a technical amendment to the legislation under which the orders are made. I repeat, to reassure the Committee, the assurance noted by the JCSI that the orders will be made only if the House approves not only these drafts but the Finance Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Companies House became one of the first executive agencies in October 1988. It is appropriate that trading fund status should coincide with its third anniversary as an agency. Since it became an agency, Companies House has made considerable strides in enhancing the quality of the service that it provides to customers and in developing new, improved services. That has gone hand in hand with improved productivity and reduced real unit costs. Companies House believes that trading fund status will help it achieve further progress in these important areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The benefits of being a trading fund will show themselves in a number of ways. As a trading fund, Companies House will have direct control over, and much greater awareness of, its cash flow. That will sharpen its financial management and produce more effective discipline over costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the past few months, a new commercial accounting system has been installed at Companies House. The system is already providing management with improved information about movements in costs and in income. Companies House will have greater control over the planning of its capital investment programme, which is of considerable importance, as the agency is planning a considerable investment in image technology, using digital techniques to store and retrieve the images of documents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statutory disciplines of having to break even and meet the further financial objectives will sharpen the
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
management's accountability for delivering an efficient and cost-effective service. If the House approves the order, a Treasury minute will be laid, setting the additional financial objectives of achieving a reduction of real unit costs by an average of 2 per cent a year from 1 October 1991 to 31 March 1995 and a 6 per cent average annual real rate of return on capital employed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The movement of the Patent Office to a trading fund regime will provide a direct link between revenue and expenditure of all types. The Patent Office, as is the case with Companies House, will be able to borrow from the Department when necessary and to set aside reserves towards funding future capital expenditure, as approved by Ministers during its corporate planning cycle. These financing arrangements, taken with the announced agency targets, will provide commercial disciplines that will benefit the Patent Office and its customers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The additional financial target for the Patent Office will be to break even, taking one year with another, after making provision for a 6 per cent real rate of return on the capital employed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Majorie Mowlam 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Redcar)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Starting with which year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one minor change in the reporting arrangements for the Patent Office to which the order will give effect. At present, the Patent Office lays before Parliament a statutory annual report, which includes financial data, on a calendar year basis. It would be wasteful if it continued to produce that data on a calendar year basis and to produce full accounts for the financial year. The order therefore aligns the Patent Office's statutory reporting basis with the financial year; the calendar year may, however, be retained for reporting well-established series of statistics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Trading fund status for Companies House and the Patent Office is a logical devleopment in helping the chief executives to provide as efficient and high quality a service as is practicable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.34 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My informant, who usually briefs me prior to debates on Companies House, is unfortunately on holiday. He is Mr. Edwin Fleming, who is the senior librarian at the Liverpoool Commercial library. The House has much to be grateful for to Mr. Fleming because, over the years, he has kept a close watch on the actions of civil servants in recommending to Ministers whatever changes they thought were necessary in the operations of Companies House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my most recent batch of mail from Mr. Fleming was correspondence from the Law Services Association. That was followed by a letter from that association to myself. I shall read parts of it to the Committee, to which perhaps the Minister will respond. It reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As a member (since its creation) of the Companies House Users Group, this Association has been invited to comment on the proposal to seek parliamentary approval for trading fund status for Companies House."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0450">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
The writer enclosed a copy of his reply to Companies House, which said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"You will appreciate that we are most concerned that the proposed major change in the financing arrangements for the executive Agency of Companies House will result in—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) A reduction (rather than an improvement) in the efficiency of the 'primary function' of Companies House."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, the association believes that there will be a reduction in efficiency. Perhaps the Minister will comment on that. The letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(b) A significant increase in the cost of maintaining the basic services needed to provide the fundamental right to the wider public (including the business community) of access to all information held by the Registrar of Companies."</p></blockquote>
The association is saying that there will be
	<br><blockquote><p>"A significant increase in the cost of maintaining the basic services".</p></blockquote>
Perhaps the Minister may also care to comment upon that. The letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(c) The Executive Agency creating for itself a monopoly whereby the availability, efficiency, quality and cost of services would be dictated (without commercial competition) solely by that Agency."</p></blockquote>
Is the Minister telling the Committee today that we are talking about a monopoly supplier of information?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member --> 	<div class='membercontribution'>	<i>indicated asset</i>.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to have that on the record because the next point raises the question of privatisation:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(e) The ultimate privatisation of Companies House (as was contemplated in 1982) albeit by a 'back door method'"—</p></blockquote>
perhaps I should repeat that while the Minister is considering these matters—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(e) The ultimate privatisation of Companies House (as was contemplated in 1982 albeit by a "back door method'".</p></blockquote>
I think the reference there is to an Adjournment debate in 1982 on these matters when we challenged "The Way Forward", adopted by the Department on the basis of the European directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the question about privatisation because it cannot be in the public interest to privatise a monopoly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is the Government's intention to privatise at some stage, having gone through the process of setting up an agency and of adopting trading fund status, surely during our debate today some comment or reference must be made to the prospects of privatisation or how it is possible to privatise a service which, in effect, is, and will inevitably remain, a monopoly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter also said that there will be
	<br><blockquote><p>"(d) An escalation in the scale of Companies House fees and charges, if the cost of operations financed by a trading fund exceeds the revenue in respect of goods and services provided in the course of those operations."</p></blockquote>
Perhaps the Minister will also comment on that. If he cannot deal with some of these matters in detail today, I am sure that the whole Committee will want to invite correspondence from him in order to deal with our points. When it is said that there will be an escalation in
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
the scale of Companies House fees and charges, the Minister has a responsibility to deal with the matter. Over the years we have been told and we have repeatedly brought instances before Parliament of when, certainly in the view of Mr. Edwin Fleming, charges have risen far in excess of inflation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final point that is made will be of concern to this Committee and to the wider membership of the House; it is the question of accountability to Parliament being greatly diminished. We all know that through the process of executive agency status creation and the adoption of trading fund arrangements there has been some diminution of responsibility to Parliament. We currently see that with the national health service trusts. They might not be totally independent of the national health service, but to a great extent in their administration they assume responsibility for replying directly to Members of Parliament whereas, hitherto, Ministers might have felt accountable to Parliament. To what extent will accountability to Parliament be affected by the status proposed in this statutory instrument? Will it in any way give Ministers the right not necessarily to report to Parliament, by means of parliamentary answers or answering correspondence from Members? Will Ministers consider that they can devolve themselves of that responsibility?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To what extent will the right of thhe National Audit Office be circumscribed in wanting to carry out a value-for-money audit, or an audit into the affairs of Companies House? Will the NAO's powers of access be interfered with by the introduction of the order?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, has the Minister ever met Mr. G. A. Corderoy, who is the chairman of thhe Law Services Association? He wrote to me and said at the end of his letter:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I attended meetings of the Standing Committee on the Companies (No. 2) Bill passed in 1981 and would welcome, along with other members of the Users Group, an opportunity to join in any discussions that may be considered necessary or desirable and relevant to the current proposals."</p></blockquote>
Plainly, Mr. Corderoy has strong views on these matters and I am sure that he has made them clear to civil servants. Has the Minister met him and discussed with him his concerns? If not, why has he not done so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.43 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Mowlam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to add several questions to those asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Working (Mr. Campbell-Savours). A fundamental question, which the Minister has only partially tackled, is why are the Government bothering with the legislation in the first place? Why are they bothering to adopt trading fund status? In his introductory remarks, the Minister gave some reasons. He said that it was logical and would mean that chief executives could act more efficiently; those were his two main reasons. He then gave several other reasons—for example, that there would be better direct control of finance and a greater awareness of cash flow and planning. If those reasons are the Minister's only rationale for the move from executive agency to trading fund status, the question is whether those functions are performed adequately under executive agency status, as is already the case with Companies House. The Minister's remarks suggested that the executive agencies that the government
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0451">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
have set up since the mid-1980s do not control their finance directly, do not permit much awareness of cash flow, are not logical and do not help the chief executive to plan efficiently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember the debates on next-step executive agencies; the rationale behind those agencies was to improve cash flow, increase efficiency and make the chief executive's job easier. It is incumbent upon the Minister to tell us whether executive agency status failed to achieve those aims, and whether the Government feel that those agencies should adopt trading fund status. If that is not the Minister's view, it is incumbent upon him to tell us of the other reasons for moving to trading fund status. He has given no reasons that were not originally used in debates about the creation of executive agency status. What are the additional reasons for creating trading fund status? If the Minister comes up with no further reasons, he will have acknowledged that executive agency status has not worked. I hope that he will comment on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We feel that the change in status is unnecessary. Executive agency status provided all the management incentives that are appropriate to a public service. We have acknowledged elsewhere that executive agency status had advantages, and that, in relation to management incentives that are appropriate in public services, it is sufficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other side of the coin to the question that my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) raised is whether Companies House needs to operate in a fully commercial manner. Its activities are already limited by law, in that it cannot divulge information other than that required by companies, insolvency, or other legislation. Companies House is limited by the policies of the Department of Trade and Industry. As my hon. Friend said, Ministers will not allow Companies House to compete with the private sector in the provision of services that involve the assessment of information. All that Companies House can do is to provide essentially the same service, only more efficiently. We are quite happy about that laudable objective. However, trading fund status is not required to achieve it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not repeat the points that my hon. Friend made so clearly. There should not be a significant rise in costs to the customers of Companies House. We have raised that matter in debates on other statutory instruments. We want it resolved this afternoon, with details about a scale of charges. We have considered how a future Labour Government would handle next-step executive agencies and the problem of accountability, and our ideas would improve the situation. I should be interested to hear the Minister's views on accountability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.48 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister mind if I speak after he has replied, or should I intervene during his speech?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman catches my eye, he will be called to speak again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in the Committee's hands. I am anxious to answer any questions that I can. Of course I shall take up the kind offer that was made by the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours). If I cannot give him a satisfactory reply today—some of the matters that we are discussing are somewhat technical—I shall write to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked whether I have met Mr. Corderoy. Neither I nor my officials have met him. The user group was established to help the chief executive, who will want to hear the views of users. If Mr. Corderoy has any expertise on the matter, and wishes to convey it to me, I have an open door and would be happy to meet him. The hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) wanted an assurance that trading funds generally, and this trading fund in particular, were not the backdoor to privatisation. They are not. Both the Patent Office and Companies House were considered for privatisation some years ago. Privatisation was rejected in both cases. Governments do not usually use the trading fund route if privatisation is being considered. I cannot commit the next Conservative Government, which will be elected in a few months—or the one after that. I assure the hon. Member for Workington that the Government have no plans at present to privatise Companies House or the Patent Office. Companies House and the Patent Office are monopoly services. I hope that the hon. Member for Workington has been reassured on his point about privatisation, which lay behind much of what he had to say today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Workington raised an important point about accountability. We are all interested in that. Accountability will be improved because an annual report will be laid before Parliament and will be subject to consideration by the National Audit Office and, ultimately, the Public Accounts Committee, of which the hon. Member for Workington is a distinguished member. Accountability to Parliament will be no less than it is at present. Ministers will remain responsible for the overall policy framework of the Patent Office and Companies House. Day-to-day management of the bodies will be in the hands of their managers. That is not unreasonable, given the nature of the work that they do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Redcar (Ms. Mowlam) and for Workington asked whether there would be an increase in costs. As I said in my opening remarks the target will be an average 2 per cent a year reduction in real unit costs. Companies House will therefore have to reduce its costs. I hope that that will reassure the hon. Member for Workington. Some Companies House fees go towards paying for the costs of company regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister mean regulation or regulations.?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Regulations: I mean both company regulations and company regulation. I am sure that the hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0452">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
Member for Workington would not want to dilute our efforts to prevent fraud and other cases of companies engaged in misconduct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In June 1991, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, in his report laid before the House on his consultations on the possibility of making Companies House a trading fund, wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Trading fund status will require tighter financial disciplines and these, combined with the demanding quality of service targets and the commitment to customer service, will mean that Companies House provides an increasingly high quality of service to meet its customers' needs as efficiently as possible."</p></blockquote>
I was asked why there should be a move from agency to trading fund status. It is true that Companies House has performed well as an executive agency. However, why should we not put in place a formal framework that will ensure that it continues to perform as well as, and even better than, hitherto?

I do not want to detain hon. Members, but the hon. Member for Redcar asked about the financial framework of the Patent Office. The Patent Office has long had a financial duty to recover its costs—that is, taking one year with another—from its fee income. However, there was no direct linkage between the two sides of the equation. With its move to a net running cost regime, the situation relating current resources to income earned was improved, but the strict annuality of the vote system was retained. There was also no direct link between capital expenditure and the ability of the Patent Office to fund it. To move the Patent Office to a trading fund regime would provide that direct link between revenue and expenditure of all kinds.

The result of giving those two organisations executive agency status has been cost savings and improved management accountability. I imagine that worries about privatisation lie behind the Opposition's questions. Given my reassurances, I do not see why we, who are responsible to Parliament, should not put in place a formal accounting regime, which is what trading fund status is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
