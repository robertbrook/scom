	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parly Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr Tim Yeo)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>that the Committee has considered the draft Buying Agency trading Fund Order 1991.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the agreement of the Committee, it would be sensible to discuss at the same time the other order before us, namely, the draft Property Services Agency Supplies Trading Fund Order 1976 (Revocation) Order 1991.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Today's business finds us at the end of one process and at the beginning of another—the demise of one organisation, and the rebirth of another. The Committee has two draft orders before it —one to wind up the last trading fund, which still subsists under the Government Trading Funds Act 1973 and a second to establish a new fund under the Government Trading Act 1990. So we must look both backwards and forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both orders are relatively straightforward. The purpose of the first is to wind up the Property Services Agency supplies trading fund. It was originally established 15 years ago at a time when Property Services Agency Supplies had a more substantial role than it has today. The order is required because decisions on the future of the trading fund's component parts have now been taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last summer, we announced that, in the absence of any acceptable bids, the Crown Suppliers' loss-making contract furnishings business—its core business, which employed almost 500 people—would be closed. The Liverpool-based procurement body, the Buying Agency, with just over 100 staff, was to be retained in the public sector because of its potential to earn a return on the costs of providing its service, a service that was of benefit to many Departments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Discussions continued with bidders for Crown Suppliers Transport, which comprises a vehicle hire fleet and workshops, and for the Interdepartmental Dispatch Service, which served a number of Government offices with mail delivery. However, in November we concluded that the IDS could not be sold on acceptable terms. It will continue to operate in Government in my Department. Last week, we reached and announced decisions on the remaining part, Crown Suppliers Transport. Because the negotiations with the sole bidder failed to reach an acceptable agreement, the Government have decided to close the vehicle hire and workshops organisation during the next four months. Everything possible will be done for the staff, as it has been for contract furnishings staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
Since August, the closure of the contract furnishings business has proceeded smoothly. All the projects that were underway at that time have either been completed or handed over to the customer to complete. All the regional offices and showrooms have closed and the contents have been sold. The stock that was held at the Crown Suppliers' warehouse complex at Milton, in south Oxfordshire, was first reduced by discount offers to Departments, and the remainder was sold by public auction. The five warehouses are now on the market. Most claims from suppliers have been settled, and only a small number of enquiries is outstanding. The Crown Suppliers headquarters building has been sold to Property Holdings, as part of the common user estate, and the Department of Health is currently moving in. Only a small residual team of around 20 people is now needed to finalise the accounts, to clear up the small element of remaining debt and to deal with the remaining staffing issues. I pay tribute to all the staff involved, who have worked constructively towards the long close-down of a part of government that has a great history and tradition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Buying Agency meanwhile has continued to develop its separate identity in presentational, management and financial terms. The agency has set up its own finance and computer divisions, and will be investing in a new computer system to suit its more modest requirements as a standalone body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that means that, by the end of March, we shall have taken decisions on all the Crown Suppliers businesses, completed the closure of the contract furnishings business, except for residual matters, prepared the IDS for its future in Property Holdings, and started the closure of Crown Suppliers Transport. We have reached the view that the existing organisation known as the Crown Suppliers will, in effect, have ceased trading by then. It is, therefore, expedient to wind up the trading fund. That is the purpose of the first of the orders before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second order, which will be made only after the first has come into effect, is to establish a new trading fund for the Buying Agency. The main task of the Buying Agency is to enable Departments and other public sector customers to obtain a wide range of engineering, building, maintenance and domestic products and services under arrangements that provide quality assurance and value for money, and which comply with public purchasing requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 17th January 1991, we announced that the agency would become an executive agency of the Department of the Environment under the next steps initiative launched by the Government in February 1988. The aim of that major initiative is to improve management in Government to give greater efficiency and quality of service. The chief executive and staff will have greater responsibility and freedom to get on with their job, within a framework of policy and resources agreed between the Minister and the agency. They will be answerable for the agency's success in achieving its financial aims. In the case of the Buying Agency, those are to increase the volume of goods and services procured while covering the costs of providing that service and generating a small return. Creating a trading fund for the agency, as the second order proposes, would improve the business-like operation of the agency, and its ability to react quickly to its customers' needs. The order takes the normal form: schedule 1 describes the operations to be covered by the fund established by article 3. Article 4 enables the Secretary of State to lend working capital and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0228">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
article 5 sets a maximum on the amounts of loans to be issued to the fund. Schedule 2 describes the assets and liabilities to be appropriated to the fund; the amounts and values may need to be amended to reflect actuals on 1st April 1991.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Treasury minute is to be laid before the House shortly, setting out the financial targets for the agency. That will be only one test of success, and will be supplemented by other measures such as the price that the agency can arrange by comparison with the cost to the customer of buying direct from the supplier, the respone time for setting up new contracts, and the quality and delivery performance of the goods and services supplied. Converting the agency to next steps status and providing it with a trading fund is wholly justified to enable it to provide its public sector customers with better quality and value for money. It is not part of any plan to sell the agency. Indeed, the change in its business methods since our announcement that it would remain part of the public service has made privatisation unfeasible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope to be able to launch the agency on 1st May, under a new chief executive and underpinned by a framework document that is still under discussion with the trade unions and within Government. The proposed trading fund is essential to the successful long-term future of the agency in the public sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.37 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, the Minister's speech is the result of the protracted discussion that we had about the privatisation of the PSA and the Crown Suppliers a couple of years ago. At that time, the Opposition pointed out the turmoil that the Government were inviting by ending the operations for the PSA and the Crown Suppliers. The orders represent a further chapter in the story.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certain matters will still need to be under Government control. The Minister said that different Departments would have the opportunity to buy the domestic furniture and services that they required, instead of that being done centrally by the Crown Suppliers. That system must have been cheaper, however, because fewer people were involved in purchasing. Security is another issue. It was much better when the Crown Suppliers was in charge of the Government car service. Now various Departments will provide their own service. That will be untidy and could often be unsafe because a number of organisations will be involved. The dispatch service, which was one of the services provided by the Crown Suppliers, could be split between various Departments. Security furnishings was another core service provided by the Crown Suppliers but now we are told that each Department will be provided for separately. That change will apply to every item of furnishing, whether it is floor covering or anything else, and workmen will be going in and out of offices to meet the needs of the client Department. That is not satisfactory when there is a greater need than ever for security. Previously, the Crown Suppliers monitored all the workmen entering this building and security was good. It knew the workmen involved and it made arrangements with contractors before their workmen were allowed into any offices or into this building. Will the Minister explain how security will be maintained when the various Departments contract out their work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present situation is not new. In 1986 the Government untied the PSA for business arrangements
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
and, for a while, the Crown Suppliers operated on the open market and made profits. The hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) was the Minister who dealt with that. He accepted that the Crown Suppliers, operating under the untied arrangements, were efficient and in profit and that further action towards privatisation, or altering the system could not be justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another side to the issue. The Minister referred to the fact that 500 employees were working in the furniture division of the Crown Suppliers and that they provided a useful and very good service to the Departments. The question of their future must be addressed. I hope that the Minister will tell us in greater detail what will happen to those people. If the Government take their proposed action most of them will lose their jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Crown Suppliers once provided the core function of carrying out all the purchases and services required by the various Departments. It is a pity that when we already have a good, efficient, well-run service, the Government deny it the opportunity to continue. Presumably, the Government will set up more quangos in each Department because each one will tender for its own services. Their own officers will do that and their own people will monitor the tenders and establish their needs. That used to be done by the Crown Suppliers for all the Departments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One must doubt the value of setting up a new body. We are told that the old process has ended and a new organisation is being created. One must doubt the value and sense of introducing a new service when the old one has worked so effectively and efficiently, producing the means and obtaining the ends for all Departments. There is no reason to change it. The orders represent sheer Government dogma. The Minister should say why they are necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What of the future of the 500 people employed in the furnishings division? The Minister said that discussions were taking place with the trade unions that represent those people. Before any final decision is taken, the question of how those employees will fare in the future should be resolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should also address the matters relating to security. The Government must ensure that the car service and other relevant services are provided, thus maintaining the fullest possible security needed for Ministers and for hon. Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could not begin without commenting on the absence from this Committee of someone who certainly would be here if that were possible, Ian Gow. I had a great deal of time for that man who sat with me on the Public Accounts Committee. In the year before his tragic death, he made a great effort to push for the privatisation of the PSA. I may not have agreed with him on that, but he made his case delicately. He is a sad loss to the House, and I am sure that he will be a sad loss to every member of the Committee today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading of the Crown Suppliers Bill on 6 December 1989 Ian Gow said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"My hon. Friend will confirm that, from the day I arrived at Marsham street until the day I left, I was strongly in favour of bringing the Property Services Agency into the private sector."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 6 December 1989; Vol. 163, c. 366.]</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0229">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
I was there for that speech and it was given in the amusing manner in which we remember many of the speeches that he made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I oppose the orders because I believe that the transport and the furnishing contract divisions of the Crown Suppliers should not be wound up, and that the formation of the residual body due to take over after the passage of the orders should be delayed pending an inquiry into the affairs of the contract division. I also oppose the orders because I wish to prevent certain functions of the contract furniture and furnishing division from being transferred to the Buying Agency. That division, or what is left of it, remains potentially profitable. The decision to close it was premature and should not have been taken. There should be an inquiry while all the records and the key staff are still in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister said, the PSA Supplies was established as a trading fund in 1976 under the Government Trading Funds Act 1973. It was re-named the Crown Suppliers in January 1984. Since 1987 it has, increasingly, had to compete for contracts as a result of the Government's untying arrangements. Its turnover in 1988 was £233.1 million. The Crown Suppliers operates a number of divisions, but I want to deal with two only—the product supplies division, PSSD, and the transport section.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The PSSD undertakes a number of functions through the contract furniture and furnishings section based in London, and, the Buying Agency based in Liverpool. In 1989 the contract furniture and furnishings division's turnover was £93 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should draw the attention of the Committee to precisely what that division does. It is responsible for the sale of office furniture and equipment. Its principal activity is supplying wooden furniture, including principal office desk ranges, laboratory benches, Benbow furniture for the Ministry of Defence and other domestic furniture. It also provides museum showcases and a range of other items designed primarily for British Telecom, which are also available to other customers, metal furniture including office filing cabinets, office chairs, security equipment, shelving, racking and mechanical filing systems. Most of the Crown Suppliers' sales of furnishings and floor coverings are carpets, curtains, upholstery and other floor coverings. That is all undertaken in the sales division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The transport division of the Crown Suppliers includes the Government car service—which I understand will become part of Property Holdings—the secure, chauffeur-driven car service for Ministers, senior Government officials and ministerial red boxes. It also runs a taxi service which provides chauffeur-driven cars on an ad hoc basis to other authorised users, including Government officials. The division is also responsible for the Inter-Departmental Dispatch Service, which, with 68 18-cwt vans, provides a secure, same-day delivery service for mail and parcels between Government offices in central London and a next-day service to certain locations in the provinces, paid for per call. Total income from transport sevicers in 1988 has been estimated to exceed £7 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had trouble in establishing the precise areas of responsibility. I may be slightly in error, but that does not detract from the substance of what I have to say. The Crown Suppliers is bound by European Community rules on procurement. Those rules have been the subject of debate on the floor of the House on several occasions. As
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
a Government procurement agency, the Crown Suppliers should observe the European Community and general agreement on trades and tariffs—GATT—requirements that stipulate that all public sector procurement contracts above a certain annual threshold, at present some £92,000, must be open to international tender and be advertised in certain international journals. I first raised that matter on 8th May 1989. I asked the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, the hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Chope)
	<br><blockquote><p>"whether the Crown Suppliers continue to comply with established public procurement procedures and relevant EC/GATT regulations." [	<i>Official Report,</i> 8th May 1989; Vol. 152 c.354] The Minister gave me the dear undertaking, "Yes."</p></blockquote>
After the reply from the Under-Secretary, I understand that a number of civil servants protested and the Under-Secretary was told that for the previous one or two years, the Department had been breaching EC regulations and that contracts that breached the regulations had been extended. By 16th December 1989, seven months after I asked that question, 120 contracts had been extended. On 6th December 1989, on the Second Reading of the Crown Suppliers Bill, I asked the then Secretary of State for the Environment, the right hon, Member for Bath (Mr. Patten):
	<br><blockquote><p>"Is it true that the Crown Suppliers has been in breach of European directive No. 77/62 by failing to tender for certain contracts over a value of £92,000 and by extending those contracts? Is it true that the Government's Law Officers have advised the Government that they are in breach of that directive? As I have now raised this matter in the House, which will alert the European Commission, what action will the Government volunteer to take?"</p></blockquote>
The Secretary of State replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will be delighted comprehensively to answer that question when he replies to the debate, and I am sure that he will do so to the hon. Gentlemens complete satisfaction".—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 6 December; Volume 163 chapter 352.]</p></blockquote>
In his reply that day the Under-Secretary did not say one word in response to the allegations that I had made. However, on the 11 January, in Committee, the Under-Secretary said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Since the Second Reading debate, the internal audit service of the PSA has submitted a report to the permanent secretary that includes comments on the Crown Suppliers' procurement procedures … Given the commercial considerations facing the Crown Suppliers as an organisation that is to be privatised, such is the need to retain suppliers and ensure continuity of production in a period of uncertainty that it seemed that extensions of existing contracts, which had originally been let subject to EC/GATT directives, were appropriate. The internal audit report now being considered by the PSA puts that policy under question. While not disputing its good sense, the report questions whether the two proviso articles to which I have referred can be relied upon as justifying the use of the negotiated procedure for these extensions."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee D,</i> 11 January 1990; chapter 61.]</p></blockquote>
I was right According to the then Under-Secretary, the internal audit report said that the Crown Suppliers was in breach. The Under-Secretary suggested that on receipt of the internal audit report he realised that the Crown Suppliers was in breach. His remark was grossly misleading. How do we know that? Because on 25 February 1991, the new Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment honourably, if I may so, and correctly answered my question. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In July 1989, the Department of the Environment provided legal advice that negotiated procedures were permitted by the EC/GATT regulations on certain grounds which did not include difficulties arising from privatisation. The legal adviser also pointed out the requirement to draw up a written report of any negotiated procedures."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0230">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
The Minister then referred to September 1989, which was three months after I had tabled my original question:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In September 1989 the legal adviser responded to a draft report relying on reasons of urgency of supply, or incompatibility or disproportionate technical difficulties resulting from a change in supplier. His advice was that none of the considerations given for further contract extensions could be justified under the EC directive. No legal advice was sought by the Department from any other source."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 25 February 1991; Volume 186, chapter 323.]</p></blockquote>
The Minister told me that in July 1989, the Department was notified that it was in breach. That is confirmed by a letter that I received from John Bourn of the National Audit Office, to whom I had written in December 1990. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Treasury told The Crown Suppliers in March 1989 that negotiated procedures could be adopted for technical or artistic reasons, or on the grounds of extreme urgency. But they pointed out that The Crown Suppliers would need to justify each case on its merits" —</p></blockquote>
which it did not. The letter continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Although Internal Audit did not finalise their report until December 1989, they had begun to question in May 1989 whether The Crown Suppliers' policy of extending existing contracts was strictly in compliance with the EC/GATT regulations. This prompted The Crown Suppliers in July 1989 to seek clarification from the Department of the Environment.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The Department of Environment's legal adviser replied in July 1989 that negotiated procedure were permitted on certain grounds, but these did not include difficulties arising from privatization … After Internal Audit had shown the report to the legal adviser, he advised in September 1989 that none of the consideration given for further contract extensions could be justified under the EC Directive."</p></blockquote>
That means that a Minister knowingly breached regulations and extended contracts after receiving legal advice and advice from the PSA internal audit and, perhaps, other advice. He was prepared to mislead Parliament on two occasions to avoid revealing the truth. The effect was to deny a firm the right to tender, and to rob taxpayers of money that would have been made if open competition has been allowed. I argue those cases because there should be a full and complete inquiry before the Crown Suppliers is completely wound up and before any residual organisation takes over, or completes its responsibilities. The orders should not be considered by the Committee until that inquiry has been held.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In January did the Under-Secretary, prevent the contracts from being extended? We know from the National Audit Office and from parliamentary answers that, by January, he knew that what he was doing was wrong. Civil servants had advised him and they were aware that what they were doing was wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the answer is to be found in the 1990 edition of "	<i>Newsline</i>", which is the publication of the PSA branch of the Institution of Professionals, Managers and Specialists. It alleged that at the end of July 1990, at a Main Board meeting of the Crown Supplies, which the then Under-Secretary attended, the board sanctioned the extension of a further 140 contracts. I do not know whether that is true, but I should like to know. It is alluded to again in a letter from John Bourn of the National Audit Office who said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in June 1990" —</p></blockquote>
that is now 13 months after I made my original allegation in Parliament, which elicited a denial—
	<br><blockquote><p>"my staff learned that The Crown Suppliers, in order to maintain services to customers, planned to overcome the difficulties caused by the likely further slippage in the expected date of privatisation by extending some contracts for short periods and had already done so in a few cases. This was intended to allow sufficient time for the contracts to be advertised in accordance with EC/GATT regulations. As such
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
extensions appeared in the National Audit Office to be in breach of the EC/GATT regulations—a view confirmed by the Treasury in their correspondence with The Crown Suppliers —my staff raised the matter with the Chief Executive of The Crown Suppliers. As a result, and following consideration by the Crown Suppliers' Board, the issue was referred to the Accounting Officer for The Crown Suppliers. He ruled on 18th July 1990 that such extensions should not be made and that The Crown Suppliers must take the necessary steps to offer contracts in conformity with EC law."</p></blockquote>
Mr. Bourne also spoke about further monitoring of the matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it true that the section of the Crown Suppliers to which we are refering was knowingly breaching EC law for at least 13 months after I first raised the matter in Parliament?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to the people involved in what can only be described as a charade. I understand that it is not customary to identify civil servants, but I intend to do so because I do not regard them as altogether responsible. I believe that if I identify them, they will want to make representations to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the director of procurement, John Cross, was responsible for compliance, and that Jim Cousins, a finance director, was responsible for safeguarding public moneys. I am sure that I shall be corrected if I am wrong. When the Minister replied on Second Reading he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I accept my share of responsibility for the Crown Suppliers performance."— [	<i>Official Report,</i> 6th December 1989; Vol. 163 c.389.]</p></blockquote>
I should like to know the relationship between those two civil servants and the Minister. Was the Minister really only instructing, overruling them and telling them what to do without reference to the implications of that? Did those civil servants go to the accounting officer at the Department? I understand that the rules are such that people can go to the accounting officer of a Department to express concern about ministerial decisions when they feel that Ministers might be exceeding their responsibilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am thinking deep about this and naturally the Chair has to wait to see how the Minister responds to what has been said. However, when the hon. Gentleman refers to areas of government, he should bear in mind that, principally, it is Ministers, and not civil servants who are responsible to the Government. If the hon. Gentleman could bear that in mind, he can continue with his interesting submissions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that and that is why I was careful in the way in which I referred to the civil servants. It is important, however, that Parliament knows the relationship between Ministers and civil servants—which some civil servants are being required to breach—and the fact that some civil servants have had to take advice. Civil servants should know that, when they are asked to do certain things, they could use the facilities that are open to them to make complaints. That is why I identified those civil servants. However, there is another reason. Should civil servants be involved in the management buy-out?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the two civil servants mentioned were involved in a buy-out that did not come off. I understand that £76,980 was allocated to the management buy-out to cover professional fees. That comes from a parliamentary answer that the Minister gave me on 24 January 1991. I should like to know whether those moneys have been fully accounted for. Can we be told who was involved, and more about what happened? Were any moneys repaid because
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0231">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
they were incorrectly spent? Was any disciplinary action taken by any members of the management buy-out team? Did the Minister ask for the police to bye brought in to deal with any discrepancies in the use of those moneys?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to a parliamentary answer [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Is the Minister having difficulty identifying the question that referred to £76,980? If he is, perhaps I can find it for him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By all means refer to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could find it in my file. According to a written answer on 12th February 1991 in column 423, £6.3 million has been allocated to shutting down the Crown Suppliers contract furnishing division. Has that money been fully acounted for? Can we be assured that the National Audit Office will be satisfied when it examines the matter? According to another written answer on that date in column 424, the computer system primarily used in the contract furniture and furnishings division—Unisys — cost £9.7 million. What is happening to that equipment? Its software was provided to deal with accounting, stock taking, inventories and other such matters in the contract furnishing section.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will any board member benefit from being allowed to take employment with any beneficiary of an extended contract? I tabled a parliamentary question about that and the Minister gave a general reply that referred to the normal arrangements. However, specifically in this case, will any board member be allowed to benefit in that way? I have mentioned in Parliament the case of a civil servant and Pentos plc. Ministers and the National Audit Office have sought to reassure me about that, but the allegations simply do not go away. I should like to have a simple question answered: did Pentos plc benefit by way of increased orders after the civil servant, who the Minister will know from his Department and to whom I have referred, went to the golf championships?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have destroyed the furniture and furnishing contract division with the threat of privatisation. I can best illustrate that by quoting an interesting letter, which lies at the heart of today's debate. It is from John Dole, who was controller of the Crown Suppliers from 1982–86, and former comptroller of Her Majesty's Stationery Office from 1986-90. In his letter, headed
	<br><blockquote><p>"Sad words from ex-chief of TCS",</p></blockquote>
he wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I was astonished and deeply saddened to read of the government's extraordinary decision to close the contract furnishing side of TCS.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Since 1976 TCS has operated successfully as a self-financing trading fund. Until last year it met all its costs and made a modest profit".</p></blockquote>
The letter, which was written in September 1990, stated that that was
	<br><blockquote><p>"a rare achievement for an organisation operating within the constraints of central government.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Better still, it has saved government departments and other public bodies untold sums by using its expert and consolidated buying power to provide good quality goods and services, including contract furnishing, at exceptionally keen prices. Since 1983 departments have been able to purchase such goods and services direct from the private sector, yet TCS continued to flourish and retained much of its business. The customers knew a good thing when they saw it.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Only in the last three years has TCS failed to meet the Treasury's financial target. This is hardly surprising. The long drawn out uncertainties about possible privatisation have inevitably undermined the confidence of customers, suppliers and staff alike. I am convinced
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
that, given a settled future, the business would have quickly recovered. I am equally certain that, left to operate piecemeal and without TCS's expert advice, departments will, in future, pay substantially more for their contract furnishing services. Private sector firms must be rubbing their hands in glee.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Quite apart from economic considerations I am saddened to think of the effect this decision will have on many of the able and dedicated people who work for TCS. A poor reward indeed for all their years of effort, enthusiasm and service to the public—and little encouragement to anyone contemplating a career in the new-style civil service."</p></blockquote>
The turnover of the transport section in 1990—or that part of the turnover that is relevant to the Minister's latest decision—was £18 million. As I said before, the transport section of the vehicle hire and maintenance business has a total fleet of 4,000 vehicles. It supplies a full maintenance and insurance contract hire service to approximately 1,000 customers who are almost exclusively based in the public sector. It is regarded as one of the top twenty contract hire operations in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The operation was put out to bid. According to a parliamentary answer a gentleman by the name of Bill Pinkney staked out a bid in May 1990. He went to Unity Trust to raise the money, but was refused. He then went to Crufts merchant bank. I have not heard of it, but perhaps it is known to Conservative Members. [hon. Members: "Sounds like a dog show."] Yes. That was the name I was given; it may be wrong. In any case, the merchant bank refused and was surprised to be approached by a junior official of a Department with a request for money on that scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bill Pinkney then found a Mr. Bramhall, who was a car dealer from Dewsbury. He also had a Hertz franchise—I have his company accounts here somewhere. Mr. Bramhall then approached the venture capital arm of the National Westminster bank. I do not know exactly what happened, but I assume that he was successful in raising the money there. This was not really the management buy-out that the Government had suggested; it was rather Mr. Bramhall raising the money and other grafting themselves on to the arrangements that were set up. Over some months various people dropped out for various reasons which I hope will be explained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In January I asked the Minister a number of questions. I asked him
	<br><blockquote><p>"what moneys have been allocated, paid or contracted for payment to the management buy-out for the Crown Suppliers transport section connected to Mr. Bill Pinkney and Mr. Bramhall".</p></blockquote>
The Minister replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"£36,000 has been paid in support of professional fees incurred by a team led by Mr. Pinkney. Provisional agreement has been reached to provide additional support of up to a further £111,000, subject to certain conditions being met. No commitment to this further amount has so far been given. If Mr. Pinkney's team were successful in acquiring the business, the new company would have to repay all Government support."</p></blockquote>
I subsequently proceeded
	<br><blockquote><p>"To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment (1) whether he will make a statement as to the investigation carried out by the Property Services Agency audit section into the activities of Mr. Bill Pinkney; (2) whether he will list the actions taken by Mr. Bill Pinkney which led to an investigation being carried out by the Property Services Agency audit section."</p></blockquote>
The Minister was quite frank. He admitted:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An audit of travel and subsistence, and certain other expenditure in The Crown Suppliers, including the transport business in which Mr. Pinkney is employed, has been undertaken by the Property Services Agency internal audit. The Crown Suppliers management have considered and are following up the matters arising from that audit." — [	<i>Official Report,</i> 24th January 1991; vol. 184, c. 271]</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0232">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
The reference to the "Crown Suppliers management" especially interested me. Are those the same people who, according to a parliamentary reply of 12th February, were subject to an inquiry on irregularities? Will the Minister tell me? Does he recall giving me that reply? Let me refer to its explicitly. I asked him
	<br><blockquote><p>"what improprieties by the Crown Suppliers main board members have been indicated from internal departmental investigations over the last three years.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Irregularities in respect of travel claims, acceptance of hospitality and the appointment of consultants; only one case was sufficiently serious to justify disciplinary action.".—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 12 February 1991; Vol. 185, c. 423.]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I presume that there must have been an inquiry into the Crown Suppliers main board members. Another answers states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Crown Suppliers management have considered and are following up the matters arising from that audit."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 24 January 1991; Vol. 184, c. 271.]</p></blockquote>
Are the same people being referred to, or is there a distinction between the board and the management?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I received, in a brown paper envelope, a document headed "Disclipinary Matters", which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Having considered the recent Audit Report three items emerged which individually may not be serious offences. But taken together represent a level of behaviour below that which is expected of an official."</p></blockquote>
It outlines several matters that I alluded to in an early-day motion, including the following under the heading, "Sale Training Course":
	<br><blockquote><p>"Failure to declare a conflict of interest with the course organiser, namely D. A. Turnbull & Co."</p></blockquote>
That course had to do with privatisation. I understand that D. A. Turnbull is the brother-in-law of Mr. Pinkney. I am sure that Mr. Pinkney will protest loudly if I am wrong. The document continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"having considered the above the Chief Executive (PSAS) considered making formal charges, which you were made aware of, and has decided to give you the benefit of the doubt."</p></blockquote>
This is the man with whom negotiations were taking place about a multi-million pound contract to purchase the transport section of the Crown Suppliers. Last Friday the Minister slipped through an answer at 3.30 p.m. which said that the business would be closed. In effect, it, and all the jobs that go with it, will be destroyed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand how it was possible for Messrs Shandwick to produce their so-called press release, dated 28 January, within days of the answers that I received from Ministers, referring to the inquiry into the activities of the gentleman with whom negotiations were taking place. Under the heading, "Management Buy-out for TCS Transport Services", the press release states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government has today … 1990 announced that the management employee buy-out team, led by business development manager Mr. Bill Pinkney, has been successful in its competitive bid for TCS Transport Services and will take responsibility from … 199X. TCS Transport services combines specialist contarct hire and engineering operations and formed part of The Crown Suppliers.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The decision to accept the management employee buy-out's offer reflects the team's commitment to maintain the healthy results which they have achieved over the past three years."</p></blockquote>
The press release is dated 28 January, and refers to healthy results achieved during the past three years. yet last Friday the Minister announced that he was closing down the whole operation on the basis that "the profits were uncertain" I believe that those were the Minister's words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
The press release continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"With turnover in the region of £18 million last year, TCS enters the top twenty contract hire and leasing companies at a time when businesses in the private sector are predicting a long tern growth of 15–20 per cent. per annum."</p></blockquote>
The Minister announced the closure of the business last Friday, even though Shandwick, the PR company, announced two months previously that it was a buoyant business, was confident in the future, and had a potential growth of 15 per cent. to 20 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not read the whole press release, but it further states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There will be no compromise on the current high standards demand by government and customer service and quality of work will remain top priorities. Their view is that the high quality and the special nature of the services, not provided elsewhere, will continue to attract discerning customers."</p></blockquote>
We then have the confidential brief for privatisation advertisement, which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The advertisement is to be developed prior to the privatisation announcement, for insertion into weekly publications at short notice.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>It is anticipated that two parts of TCS Transport Services—TCS Contract Hire, TCS Engineering Services—will be sold to a management buyout team. the MBO includes employee share options so the company will effectively be owned by the staff. No immediate changes to the business are planned."</p></blockquote>
I do not know the relationship between Shandwick and the Department, but that was the proposed press release that it was to issue on behalf of the Government. I cannot understand why departmental officials cannot do that work. Why should such work be given to Shandwick? That firm costs the Government and the taxpayer a lot of money. I understand that many people in the House are connected with Shandwick, but my question is fair. How much did Shandwick receive for the contract to produce such rubbish? They are not my words but the Minister's, if I am to take as frank the answer that he gave to the hon. Member for Swindon (Mr. Coombs) last Friday. The Minister slipped that answer through at 3.30 p.m. when most Members of Parliament had returned to their constituencies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Wyre Forest (Mr. Coombs).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you. The hon. Member for Wyre Forest. The hon. Gentleman is correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 24th January I received an answer from the Minister on two questions on land sites and equipment. I asked the Secretary of State whether
	<br><blockquote><p>"he is satisfied that the price being agreed for the sale of the Crown Suppliers transport section fully reflects alternative uses of all five sites which form part of the sale."</p></blockquote>
I also asked
	<br><blockquote><p>"whether the sale of the five land sites belonging to the Crown Suppliers transport section provides for a valuation based on existing use value, planning hope value, or a valuation based on approved planning applications following the completion of any sale."</p></blockquote>
The Minister replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government are concerned to ensure that they obtain a fair price for the business, having regard, among other things, to the market value of the assets, including the land. To this end independent professional valuations of the freehold sites have been obtained."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 24th January 1991; Vol. 184, c. 270.]</p></blockquote>
I have experience of those so-called professional valuers. Professional valuers valued the sites of Cumberland Motor Services in my constituency. They valued a site in Keswick at £123,000 in 1988, which was sold for nearly £700,000 in 1989. I understand that in 1990 the site was sold again for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0233">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
substantially more than that. I am worried about these professional valuers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence given to the Public Accounts Committee when we dealt with the sale of the National Bus Company and also the evidence to be published in the appendices to our report, outline further information obtained from civil servants. The discrepancies are huge. Valuations placed on innumerable properties and land in the National Bus Company portfolio and belonging to its component operations are, when compared with prices subsequently realised on acquisition prior to property development, a public scandal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To be frank, I do not believe those valuations. It is not that I know the sites; I do not trust the valuers. I shall make a point of following in detail what happens to three sites. If the Minister asks his ministerial colleagues, he will know that I come back to Departments year after year, about matters that I keep on a permanently turning file in my office. I have singled out three sites for special attention. They are Nine Elms, London — £1·5 million; Burnett, Bristol—£0·7 million; and Biggleswade—£1·5 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be helpful to the Committee and to my hon. Friends who probably have other things to do if I point out that since it was decided earlier this month not to privatise the Crown Suppliers Transport and that those of its assets that will not be used by other Government Departments will be sold for the benefit of the taxpayer, it is rather academic to pursue this point about valuers. It might have had some relevance if we had been going ahead with the privatisation. As we are not, the time of the Committee is being taken up unnecessarily.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I detect something else. I detect that they might be very special figures. It might be that in the sale that will inevitably take place—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister has intervened in the proceedings to suggest that the matter should not be pursued for the reasons that he gave. As I understand it, and the minister may correct me, he was talking about what was intended. We are dealing with the position as it is at present, which is the revocation of one order. When that is out of the way because the Committee has considered it before it goes to the House for eventual acceptance, we shall consider the new order. I must tell the Minister, with respect, that we cannot deal with a situation which is not exactly hypothetical, because the intention is there and it will happen, but which has not yet happened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also heed your strictures, Mr. Leadbitter. I am sure that they were meant to apply equally to me. I will follow events at those three sites with great interest. As long as the Minister is in the Department he will have the pleasure or displeasure of answering my questions on those matters. I shall follow matters very closely and, furthermore, I shall draw them to the attention of the National Audit Office. I am sure that John Bourn will be interested in them, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I want to talk about the other assets, the vehicles, of which there are 4,000. The Minister intervened just now to say that the assets would be sold off. How will they be sold? Can we have an assurance that they will not be sold by tender? If they are sold by tender they will fetch a low price. Can we have an assurance that they will not be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
sold before discussions take place with the trade unions about the future of the transport section? They might want to talk to the Ministers about these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the vehicles are to be sold, it should be by public auction. I do not expect the Minister to put 4,000 adverts in the 	<i>Evening Standard</i> and to sit on the end of his phone waiting to do a deal for the extra £10 here and there. These vehicles cost thousands of pounds. The profile of the fleet—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Anthony Durant 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Reading, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that public auctions are often not quite as successful as putting things out to tender? Would he complain if far less money was received at a public auction than could have been got by going out to tender? Would he make that criticism having made this suggestion here?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I might go into the detail of how I would sell the assets after the winding-up of this organisation without straying out of order, Mr. Leadbitter, it depends on how they are put into auction. If they are all put into the same auction, they will sell for a very low price. If they are spread throughout the whole of the United Kingdom through various auction rooms over a long period, they will fetch a much higher price. Again, I will take great note of that if those vehicles have to be sold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not completely convinced that there is a need to sell off. Why sell off a potentially profitable business that, in the words of Shandwick, currently has high standards and whose top priorities will remain customer service and quality of work. Shandwick wrote this brief for Government Ministers and it said that the Crown Suppliers transport services were capable of maintaining the healthy results that had been achieved over the past three years. Why sell it off?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the accounts for the Crown Suppliers transport services, the cost of acquisition of vehicles was £24.8 million; the net book value on 31 December 1987, was £16.8 million. I am sure that those figures can be updated. I shall ask the National Audit Office to examine the arrangements that have been made for the sell-off of the assets of the transport section of Crown Suppliers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both organisations should have been retained. There was no need to get rid of them. The hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Chope), who made his reputation flogging off refuse collection services in the borough of Wandsworth, is obsessed with privatisation. It is he who is responsible for the major errors of judgment. I do not blame the current Minister—he was not in the Department when these things happened. The hon. Member for Itchen is fired by an ideology which, we hope, died when the former Prime Minister involuntarily retired.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will reconsider matters, especially in the transport section. Little remains of the contract furniture and furnishing divisions. Admittedly the buying agency will take over part of the responsibility for floor coverings or something like that, but little remains. There is still room for manoeuvre in the transport section. I ask the Minister to consider these matters and not simply to follow the dogmas of his predecessor, because they ravaged the Crown Suppliers, which, apart from 1985, exceeded its return target set by the Government, and which under better management by Ministers would have been a viable operation today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Sayeed 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) is a noted conspiracy theorist. I do not intend to reply to his argument except to say that no doubt this set of allegations will prove to be as hollow as many of his earlier ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister is also the captain of the Parliamentary golfing society, which is apposite, if we bear in mind one of the points made by the hon. Member for Worthington. In schedule 2, under the asset heading, I noticed that there was no item for good will. Why is that? Is it because the fund is to be retained in the public sector? Is it because no estimate can be made? Is it the way in which the accounts have been constructed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.37 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friends will agree that this has been an interesting debate. I hope that I shall have an answer to the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, East (Mr. Sayeed) when I have finished answering the other points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends and I do not backtrack on our support for the principle of privatising as many functions of the public sector as we can. I am at one with my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Chope) in his determination to ensure that there is no unnecessary retention in the public sector of jobs which can be done as well or, more likely, better and more cheaply by the private sector. If we can transfer them to the private sector, we shall continue to do so with all speed. It is without foundation to suggest that the events of four months ago have in any way changed the Government's commitment to a full and robust programme of privatisation. I see no advantage in retaining in the public sector a business that was losing substantial sums, as the furnishing suppliers were.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his speech, the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) seemed slightly confused about exactly what was proposed for some services. The Government car service, to which the hon. Gentleman referred, will continue to be operated centrally by Property Holdings. Similarly, as I said earlier, the IDS will also be operated centrally by Property Holdings. The provision of security furniture, as opposed to general office furniture, will also continue to be operated by Property Holdings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the responsibility of the customers of these businesses to meet their own security requirements, except in relation to the special functions that I have already mentioned. That is a perfectly satisfactory arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Giving Government Departments the freedom to decide where they will make their purchases in future—something that we have been moving towards for some years —is already showing substantial savings. We estimate that savings of more than £1.3 billion have been made over the past five years. I am confident that this policy, to which we remain wholly committed, will lead to greater efficiency and further savings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Normanton referred to the staff. As happens when parts of the public sector are closed down, every effort has been made to find alternative jobs in the civil service for the staff of the contract furnishing business who are affected. We have found jobs for about 200 of the 493 staff in the contract furnishing business since the closure was announced. We knew that it would be difficult to find alternative posts for the design and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
furnishing specialists and for the non-mobile industrial staff at Milton and Cardiff. I take this opportunity of saying how grateful we are to the staff for continuing to work as best they can even though their jobs are coming to an end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the Buying Agency, we are not replacing something that already exists with a new set-up. Although these two orders which we are debating today need to be implemented, the operation of the agency is evolving, rather than stopping in one form and starting up again in another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The remaining 250 staff to which the Minister referred have been loyal throughout this process. Despite knowing that their jobs are on the line, they have performed their duties efficiently and adroitly. However, the Minister has not said what will happen to them. Will they be made redundant? Can they be transferred to other jobs and given further employment opportunities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the transfer of the Crown Suppliers, its staff had to remain loyal to the department. They could not benefit from giving private companies information about whether there would be a buy-out or transfer. In this case, the staff have also been very loyal, and the Government should show them loyalty in return. The Minister should give us further detail on the important issue of their future instead of saying simply that 200 people have been found alternative employment and not referring to the remainder of the staff. That is not satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, the Minister said that, for security reasons, certain functions would remain in the public sector. Under the Property Services Agency and Crown Suppliers Act 1990, wide-ranging powers are given to the Secretary of State. Is he using those powers, or are special provisions made? The Minister said that cars, security furniture and other items would be left in the public sector, but where is the cut-off point? What are the arrangements for deciding what should be retained in the private sector and what should be sold off, offered or made redundant by the various Departments?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position is woolly, as it appears that some items can be retained in the public sector while others have to be disposed of because of the dogma to which the Minister referred. But there is no clear-cut explanation of how that is decided. I hope that the Minister can give us a satisfactory response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Every effort has been made to try to find alternative employment in the civil service for the staff affected by the closure, but, inevitably, it has not been possible to redeploy every one of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the announcement was made, we established a personnel change unit which was designed, first, to try to locate other jobs in the civil service for as many of those staff as possible. Secondly, the PSA appointed an outplacement company which, as the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) probably knows, is a firm that specialises in advising people who face redundancy on how to market their skills most effectively to prospective new employers. It was provided to give career counselling and advice and to help people who were to be made redundant to prepare their resumes on leaving Government service. That out-placement service was available at all the locations affected by redundancies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
We have gone to considerable lengths to try to help the staff who, unfortunately, have lost their jobs as a result of that closure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer the Minister to a statement made by the Secretary of State for the Environment on 6 December 1989. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I know from having met the PSA trade unions that there is some uncertainty and concern and I can well understand that, but I assure the staff that their fears are unnecessary: the aim of the privatisations will be to create viable, vigorous competitive organisations in the private sector".—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 6 December 1989; Vol. 163, c. 353.]</p></blockquote>
By his reply of last Friday, the Minister is dismantling undertakings given by the Secretary of State on 6 December 1989. A promise was given but the reply of last Friday undermined it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not true. My right hon. Friend was giving assurances about the future of staff in the event that, as was hoped at the time, those businesses were privatised. If it had been possible to privatise them, I have no doubt that a great number of the staff would have had extremely satisfactory careers under the new arrangements. As the Committee knows—it was not known in December 1989—it has not proved possible to privatise the businesses, so the circumstances are entirely different. The whole basis of my right hon. Friend's remarks at the time was quite different from the position that we face today. Regrettably, a number of staff are being made redundant, and I have mentioned the considerable efforts that we are making on their behalf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Normanton referred to the powers of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, but the circumstances are not as difficult as he believes. The Government car service and the IDS are discrete entities. The IDS has been developed as a separate function within what was the Crown Suppliers in the past 18 months or so. Therefore, it is possible to define it as a single entity. That applies similarly to the Government car service, so there is no blurring of the line that defines what is being retained in the public sector and what is not. The matter is clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Workington appears to be a little frustrated about the decision that we took earlier this month to close Crown Suppliers Transport. That seemed to take much of the sting out of his remarks, most of which I think were prepared before he was aware of our decision. He was trying to suggest that we would somehow be acting improperly by privatising the business—perhaps involved in that privatisation were people whom we did not particularly like. However, as we have decided not to privatise it, much of the thrust of the hon. Gentleman's argument was lost. I am sorry that he finds it inconvenient that we use written parliamentary answers as a means of communicating information to the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On Fridays at 3 pm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall continue to use that mechanism. I urge the hon. Gentleman to be especially vigilant on Fridays. Instead of going to his constituency, he should perhaps wait at the Vote Office for the answers to questions. I have no doubt that he would find that rewarding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has missed the point. I was asking whether it was proper for Ministers to enter into negotiations or to carry on such negotiations with people who were subject to disciplinary offence
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
allegatons. Was it proper for Shandwicks to produce that press release? Will the Minister answer those questions? How much was paid? Who gave the instruction? Who decided on the wording of the press release, after the Minister answered questions, having recognised the substance of that allegation? Despite what the hon. Member for Bristol, East (Mr Sayeed) said, the allegations were not mine, but were made by Department officials and were upheld in Parliamentary answers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Glentleman will allow me, I shall answer all those questions, but I just wanted to comment on his apparent dissatisfaction with the procedure that we use to give him and other hon. Members information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman spoke initially about the contract furnishing business, which incurred substantial losses in 1989. That in itself is a good reason for considering whether it should be retained in the public sector. He asked about contract extensions by the Crown suppliers, so it may be helpful if I fill in a little of the background. The overall policy on public purchases requires purchasers to base their requirements on value for money—in other words quality and delivery against price. We believe that goods and services should be acquired by competition unless there are compelling reasons to the contrary. Competition avoids any suggestion of favouritism and discourages monopoly. It also helps to promote efficiency and economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The form of competition must be appropriate to the value and complexity of goods and services to be acquired. Some contracting authorities are required to be advertised internationally under EC and GATT rules. Even when those rules do not apply, it can be a useful means of ensuring that the potential of the market is fully tested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem concerning the application of EC and GATT requirements in the Crown Suppliers started in the middle of 1988, when negotiated procedures were adopted to extend contracts for six months. The reason for doing this was to extend the expiry dates beyond the then expected date of privatisation, after which different procedures would apply to the letting of contracts. At that point the justification for the policy was said to be the urgency of supply and the unavailability of an alternative supplier. The Crown Suppliers believed that these reasons were sufficient to constitute an exemption from the EC directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in March 1989, the Treasury advised the Crown Suppliers that extensions to contracts were not recognised under EC and GATT rules. Each had to be considered as a new contract which had to be consistent with the rules. Negotiated agreements could be adopted for technical or artistic reasons, or on the grounds of extreme urgency. Each case would have to be considered on its merits, against these criteria.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During 1989, PSA internal audit working for the Crown Suppliers began to question whether the practice of extending contracts was strictly in accordance with EC and GATT regulations. That led the Crown Suppliers to consult the Department's legal advisers. Their advice was that negotiated procedures were permitted on certain grounds, although difficulties arising from privatisation were not among those grounds. They also pointed out the need for a written report setting out the circumstances of negotiated procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Crown Suppliers set about preparing that report. I shall not trouble the Committee by going through the detail
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0236">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
of that process. The next stage was further legal advice that none of the considerations set out in that report seemed to be justified under European Community directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The report was drawn up in August 1989.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So, by the time that the Property Servces Agency and Crown Suppliers Bill was going through the House, the facts suggested that a number of contracts had been extended in circumstances that would appear to be in breach of the EC and GATT requirements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister slipped six months. Will he confirm that the Crown Suppliers drew up that report in August 1989?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The hon. Member for Workington suggested that the number of contracts was 120, but that is quite wrong. The figure is substantially less than that. The hon. Gentleman alleged that the Crown Suppliers had systematically avoided European Community requirements to open its supply contracts to competition within the European Community. He went on to say that contracts had been extended in clear breach of European Community directives, and that the standard of public accountability that the House expects had clearly been breached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fact, most Crown Suppliers contracts had continued to be met in full accordance with EC and GATT requirements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Most.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the case of the contract extensions the requirements do not appear to have been fully satisfied. Whether there was a legal breach in any case could be conclusively established only by the European Court of Justice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the brief must have been written with extreme care. may I stop the Minister at the word "most"? Will he look back a sentence or two in his brief and explain what he meant by "most"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I meant was that not every single contract had been let in full accordance with EC and GATT requirements, as we have acknowledged. A number were not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give the value of all the contracts that were in breach of the August 1989 report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that it is not our practice to reveal such information, which could be of considerable commercial value to others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The organisation will no longer exist, so to whom will the information be of commercial value? Who will benefit, if all the organisations are closed down? Why does not the Minister simply give us the figures? We want to know the contract values and the number of contracts. Perhaps he could give me a real explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. It is quite sufficient for the purposes of the Committee to know that the majority of contracts were let in accordance with the requirements but, as we have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
acknowledged, a number were not. I must take this opportunity—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can I put it to the Minister that he is deliberately misleading—not deliberately; that is an unparliamentary term. I am sorry, Mr. Leadbitter. He is misleading the Committee in the way that he is presenting his case. Why does he not tell us the full story? We want to know those figures. Parliament is entitled to know. The taxpayer is entitled to know about the volume, the number of contracts and the sum of money spent on the contracts. We do not even need to know to whom the contracts were given. We are not asking for the name of the contractor. We all know the name of the procurer or purchaser. All that I am asking for is the number and the values. Why cannot we be given those figures?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not our practice to reveal commercially sensitive information of that kind. The contracts go to companies in the private sector and information about some of those contracts could be of value to competitor companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who? They will not be indentified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I do not intend to depart from our established practice—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From your brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, from our established practice on this subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sayeed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend confirm that the contracts were let in the best long-term interests of the British taxpayer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. My hon. Friend has put his finger right on the point. I am grateful to him for his intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Bristol, East (Mr. Sayeed) intervenes to say that the contracts were let in the best long-term interests. How can he possibly say that? If the contracts had been put out to tender, a better design may have been available at a lower price with better delivery terms. The value-for-money considerations of British tax payers may have led them to conclude that we should change the supplier. How can the hon. Gentleman make that intervention and the Minister concede the point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, East (Mr. Sayeed) is probably happier for me rather than for him to answer the debate. If he has any more helpful interventions, I shall gladly give way to him in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refute the suggestion of the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) that my predecessor as Under-Secretary of State, my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The Committee agreed that we take the instruments together.
