	<section>
	<div class='legislation'>DRAFT CRIMINAL JUSTICE (CONFISCATION) (NORTHERN IRELAND) ORDER 1990</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. John Cope)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Criminal Justice (Confiscation) (Northern Ireland) Order 1990.</p></blockquote>
The draft order, a copy of which was laid before the House on 15th October 1990, is a package of measures that will empower the courts to confiscate the proceeds of certain criminal activities, notably drug trafficking, and reproduces for Northern Ireland the provisions of the Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1986 and Part VI of the Criminal Justice Act 1988. It also incorporates some measures included in the Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act 1990, which do not at present fully extend to Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Drug Trafficking Offences Act followed the report of the Select Committee on Home Affairs on the misuse of hard drugs in Sessions 1984–85 and 1985–86. Since then, confiscation provisions have been extended to cover the proceeds of almost all indictable offences and the few profitable summary offences listed in Schedule 1. I regard it as particularly important in Northern Ireland because of the amount of money going from crime to terrorism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must deal firmly with present serious abuses, but we must also try to anticipate the likely future directions of serious crime and cut them off at the pass. We cannot always wait for the law to lumber into action after a particular type of crime had reached epidemic proportions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will be aware that there has recently been considerable police activity concerning criminal rackets in Northern Ireland, and that it has received full Government support. If, as I hope, we can build up the pressure on the existing rackets used by the paramilitaries, we must expect them to look for new ways to diversify. Up to now there is little evidence of paramilitary drug trafficking within Northern Ireland. This is assumed to be, first, because there are easier ways for them to make money, but as I have said, we are working on that. It is also thought that to date, on the republican side at least, they have been inhibited by the revulsion which drug trafficking would attract to them from public opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we have also seen an increasing tendency, by the Provisional IRA in particular, to ignore potential public revulsion. I am thinking both of recent specific incidents, such as the horrific use of Catholic human bombs, and of the rejection of appeals from the Catholic hierarchy, from the Pope downwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances we cannot proceed on the basis that the paramilitaries will be permanently inhibited by the delicacy of their feelings from dealing in drugs, as do some
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
similar terrorist organisations on the continent and elsewhere. We must be sure that if they do the law is ready for them. If it is, perhaps we shall deter them from trying that ghastly trade. Effective action against drug trafficking requires a concerted international effort. The United Kingdon is already party to a number of agreements on such matters, and has signed the United Nations convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, known as the Vienna Convention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Hunter 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Basingstoke)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. Friend the Minister clarify paragraph 6 of the explanatory document, which refers to other countries with which we have agreements? What arrangements do we have with the Republic of Ireland? Are there arrangements for the confiscation of the proceeds of crime deposited or invested in the Republic of Ireland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have signed the Vienna Convention. The draft order completes the United Kingdom-wide legislation which, we hope, will enable us to ratify the convention early in 1991. The Republic of Ireland has also signed the Vienna Convention, but has not yet passed the legislation necessary to put it into effect, but we expect it to do so to ratify the convention. The Republic of Ireland would then have similar law that would enable us to follow the proceeds of drug trafficking across the border with the Republic, just as we can with other countries which ratify the convention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions of the draft order follow those contained in the Great Britain legislation that I mentioned and which were debated at length in the House. The provisions now before the Committee were the subject of a public consultation operation, including an explanatory document which explained the provisions in detail. This produced few comments. In these circumstances I shall not spell out the meaning of each article to the Committee, but I shall endeavour to explain any part of the draft order that Members wish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.36 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kevin McNamara (Kingston-upon-Hull, North)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We support the order. It is vital that no one should be able to follow his wicked trade, whether it be terrorism, drug trafficking, or what is now called ordinary decent crime, and make a profit at the expense of the community. We fully support the purpose and scope of the legislation and welcome the Minister's comment that, in completing the order, the scale of the United Kingdom's legislation and its international ramifications will be complete. Opposition Members look forward to the early ratification of the Vienna Convention. That is of the utmost importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all pleased to see the police activity against racketeering, which had been a cause of great scandal throughout the Province. It provided an important source of income for the Provisional IRA and other terrorist organisations. We are indebted to the hon. Member for Boothferry (Mr. Davis) for his work in preparing a paper that listed various types of racketeering and drew them to the attention of the Government, the House and the community. The hon. Gentleman's pamphlet contained useful suggestions—not all of which I agree with—about blocking new avenues sought by terrorists and evil men for future proceeds as the RUC and police forces in Great Britain and elsewhere close the existing ones. The hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0017">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Gentleman draws attention to methods of dealing with such matters in the United States, although such methods are not necessarily acceptable in the United Kingdom. The Minister said that because of public revulsion the Provisional IRA does not engage in drug trafficking. Despite its electoral tactic in Dublin and elsewhere of purporting to lead the fight against drug trafficking, there is no reason to believe that the IRA will not in future engage in that activity if its other sources of revenue are cut. The Minister was wise to draw that matter to the Committee's attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday there was a short, but important debate in the other place. When winding-up, Lord Skelmersdale said
	<br><blockquote><p>"The provisions of the order will form part of the general criminal law. As such they will apply to a whole range of offences such as armed robbery, theft, fraud, blackmail and intimidation. It is to be hoped that, as part of the general criminal law, the order will have some impact on these types of crime".—[	<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 19 November 1990; vol. 7, c. 612.]</p></blockquote>
The important point made in our debate in the Chamber yesterday and underlined by Lord Skelmersdale in the other place was that our dealings with terrorism in Northern Ireland should, as far as possible, be seen to be part of ordinary general law. Although exceptions may sometimes regrettably, be necessary, we should not seek to make them. It is critical to demonstrate that we are using ordinary general law against terrorists. Therefore, I stress the importance of placing the order in the context of general legislation. The order places terrorism in Northern Ireland alongside Mafia type crime as ordinary, nasty criminality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.41 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for welcoming the order and our intended ratification of the Vienna Convention. As I said, we are following almost exactly the law that applies in England and Wales and in Scotland. There are only minor differences and we are slightly closer to Scottish law in one or two respects. Except
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
in small technical matters, however, the law is—to all intents and purposes—the same throughout the United Kingdom. Of course, England and Wales legislation is similar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman was right to emphasise that the order is not terrorist specific, nor Northern Ireland specific. It deals with crime indiscriminately. We know that terrorists and paramilitaries are involved in ordinary, and especially financial, crime in a big way. It is important that such crimes are dealt with through the ordinary process of law. We are considering future proposals and have ideas for dealing with racketeering. We are studying the issues carefully.

I cannot guarantee to the hon. Gentleman or the Committee that future legislation on terrorist finances will be the same throughout the United Kingdom. We may need terrorist specific and Northern Ireland specific legislation to deal with certain financial activities of terrorists and paramilitaries. However, I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the more legislation applies across the United Kingdom the better. However, he will know that the operation of terror enables paramilitaries to carry out certain activities that would be impossible on this side of the Irish sea. For that reason, some legislation may, as I said, need to be either Northern Ireland or terrorist specific. However, the general principle behind the hon. Gentleman's remarks is entirely accepted by the Government. I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
