	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the National Health Service Training Authority (Abolition) Order 1991.—[	<i>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harriet Harman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Peckham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that we have the opportunity to discuss this statutory instrument, because I should like the Minister to deal with some questions on specific plans for training in the national health service. I am sure that the Committee agrees that training is important—it seems to be everyone's big idea at the moment—and that training in the NHS is crucial. Training is bound to be especially important when many changes are occurring. In the NHS there are not only management changes, which require new skills, but demographic changes. The NHS has to work against the background of a growing number of elderly people. Training must also equip NHS staff to deal with changes in information technology, medical technology and rapid developments in medical science.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Training is necessary when the shape of the work force is changing. We all know about demographic changes, such as the fall in the number of school leavers. Training is affected by demographic changes not only in NHS patients—a growing number of elderly and disabled people—but by the availability of the work force. As there are fewer school leavers, we have to look to people who are of growing importance in the NHS, such as older and, especially, women workers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister to deal with the overall theme of the approach to training to discover whether she understands the importance of the changes that I have outlined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Training is important for the NHS —I am sure that the Minister agrees—but how will it be secured in the internal market? The worry is that training will become increasingly slimmed down as health authorities, as providers, try to reduce their costs to lower contract prices. If money is spent on training, care and efficiency will be improved in the long term. It is a good long-term investment. Will providers take that approach in the internal market? Will not they consider the unit cost of present and future contracts and will not that instil into the system short termism, which prevents important long-term strategic training? I do not want training to suffer similar blight to buiding maintenance, whereby authorities keep things going on a day-to-day basis because they are strapped for cash, rather than improving buildings. Similarly, authorities might not train staff—the fabric of the NHS. I should be grateful if the Minister would say how she will secure the future of training within the internal market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
What controls will there be over training and the contribution that opted-out hospitals should make to it? We know that the private sector makes virtually no contribution to training staff in the NHS. We do not want opted-out hospitals to take a similar stance and poach staff who have been trained by directly managed hospitals without contributing to their training. Opted-out hospitals, which, like directly managed units, must pay their capital charges and remain financially viable, should not consider training merely as an option. We do not want them to think, if they are strapped for cash and have not got certain contracts that they had counted on getting that, to reduce their unit costs, they should cut back on training expenditure and pay a little bit extra for staff who have been trained in the local district directly managed hospital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will the opted-out hospitals fit in? Having floated them off into independence, how will the Minister ensure that they play their part in providing training as well as services in the national health service? That will be particularly important if the second wave of opting out proceeds, for otherwise the situation will be patchy and odd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will the training resources be? How much money will be allocated for training in the national heath service for the next five years? Perhaps we can compare that figure with how much was available to the National Health Service Training Authority in 1990–91, including the additional money spent on commissioned work. If the Minister will give us that figure, we can use it as a starting point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will money for training in the NHS be ring fenced? We do not want a notional sum made available for training which is then pinched from the training budget and used for other purposes. Does the Minister envisage the training funding being increased, reduced, or kept the same? How will she ensure that her intentions are put into practice?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My next important point deals with staff involvement in the development of training. Obviously, Staff must be involved in developing staff training programmes. It is no good developing programmes in isolation. Staff must be involved to improve the quality of the training programme and to ensure that they will work. It is no good people in different ivory towers, whether at regional, district or Department of Health level, working out training programmes and then being astonished when they do not work in practice if the programmes were not developed in partnership with the people running them at the local level and representing the staff who go on training courses. I mean not simply letting staff see the programmes before the envelopes are sent out but developing programmes through consultation. The NHSTA represented staff interests, but the shadow advisory board for the new central training function has no staff representatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will be the advisory board's terms of reference? Will it meet in public, as the NHSTA did, or behind the scenes? What are the terms of office of the advisory board's members? Who will those members be? How often will the advisory board meet, whom will it advise and shall we know what its advice is?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will training information be co-ordinated nationally? Will every regional and district health authority be given responsibility for training? It is important to have training responsibility at all levels, but we do not want a reinventing of wheels at different levels. We want to see good practice being picked up and shared. How will the NHS
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0088">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
management executive intervene if training is not up to scratch in different district health authorities and different directly managed units? Perhaps "enforcement mechanism" is too strong a phrase but how shall we be certain that quality of training will be maintained?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What plans are there to tackle the specific training needs of women and older workers? The NHSTA used to have an advisory committee on equal opportunities, which was abolished. There is only one woman on the advisory board, yet one of the most important aspects of training is the training of women workers. The Minister and I have issued alternate press releases on the fact that the NHS is still a largely segregated work force and still forms a pyramid with men at the top and women disproportionately represented in the lower levels. That is bad for the NHS workers and it is also a wasteful way for the NHS to manage the resource that the staff represent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How shall we succeed with an advisory board of men and only one woman? That is a great worry. One of the things we have learned over the last few hunded, if not thousand, years is that men cannot be left in charge and be expected to bring about structural changes that recognise the changing role of women at work. That is one of the reasons why I worry about the all-male Cabinet. How shall we get this group of men on the shadow advisory board to make the changes that the Minister has said are needed to integrate the NHS and to end the job segregation of men and women? Where will the detailed work on equal opportunities be dealt with and will the advisory board be equal to that task? I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.42 am.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Health (Mrs. Virginia Bottomley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I warmly welcome the opportunity to describe our plans for the new training directorate. I appreciate the contribution by the hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) because I entirely endorse her remarks that training is fundamental to our ability as a national health service to provide the quality of care that we all wish to achieve in the context of changing technology, changing expectations and changing demography.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let there be no mistake—training and education are major priorities for the Government and the NHS, but not training in a vacuum or training for training's sake. It should be training that responds to local needs, meets clear objectives and leads to the real fulfilment of individual potential. The hon. Member for Peckham said that it was no good having ivory towers and that we needed to share good practice. The plans we have set in motion for the establishment of the training directorate are precisely intended to meet those objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to spell out in detail the issues involved, because our discussions in the House often understandably focus on service provision and on patients' concerns and it is easy to overlook training. I was pleased to see last year that the training agency reported that the health sector provided an especially high number of training days for its employees —twice the national average. There is a high level of professional training in the health service. Working paper 10 for the first time sets out the plan for professional training whereby the regions will have responsibility and will be top slicing money to ensure that key professional staff are available to meet the service demands of the present and future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Some £570 million is spent on pre-registration nurse training in England alone. We shall be announcing further tranche of Project 2000 sites, which is a vote of confidence and an investment in the nurses—a fundamental group within the work force. Some £71 million will be spent on Project 2000 this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The training directorate is not involved in professional training, which will continue to be a matter for the regions under the umbrella of the statutory authorities, but with the broader training needs that the hon. Member for Peckham rightly identified. We must ensure that training is relevant to the needs and demands of the service and properly incorporated into the plans of provider units.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although some training costs will be removed from pricing decisions, accountability for training will increasingly rest with the units. As major employers, they will be charged with ensuring that staff are properly trained and developed, that training is relevant to the needs of the service, and that training represents value for money. The new training directorate will have a major part to play in ensuring that training in the NHS is of a high standard and relevant to the needs of the NHS. As plans for training in the NHS and business world have been implemented to achieve clear ends, so our proposed changes to the central training function are guided by the same principle of equipping a work force at all levels with the skills required for the 1990s and beyond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not go into the details of the training directorate except to say that it has been established as a special health authority since 1983. Careful consideration has been given over the past year to how it could be built into the health service and linked to the management executive. The staff of the NHS training authority were consulted. The director of personnel, Eric Caines, wrote a letter on 11 January setting out the thinking behind the changes. A helpline was set up so that staff could obtain further advice and information. We intend to ensure that training is in the mainstream, not on the margins, of our health service. We have had detailed discussions with the staff and others to ensure that we can provide that important service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The directorate's work will be informed by that of the training advisory board, which the hon. Lady mentioned. I can provide the hon. Lady with the names of those who will serve on the advisory board. The chairman will be Eric Caines, the director of personnel. The other members will be Stuart Fletcher, the district general manager for North Staffordshire; Peter Rankin, from South East Thames regional health authority; Christine Hannah, of the Mersey regional health authority; Andy Black, the chief executive of the Central Middlesex trust; Alfred Morris of Bristol polytechnic; Jim Hughes of Thorn EMI and Strathclyde university. There will be an observer from the Welsh Office and Dr. Tina Townsend, the training director, will be an ex officio member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The training advisory board will ensure that the directorate's work progresses to meet the training and development needs of the NHS and will both reflect and influence decisions taken in the wider training world. The board has specific responsibility for ensuring that value for money is obtained from the investments in training at all levels of the NHS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady made a comment, which received a warm welcome from me, about the desirability of finding further female members of the advisory board. When I leave the Committee, I shall set about seeing whether we can find a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0089">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
further woman to be appointed to that board. As the hon. Lady knows, we are entirely at one about the significance of the NHS having the largest group of employed women of any employer in this country, and probably in the whole of western Europe. It is not so much a matter of equal opportunitites as of good resource management. If we want to continue to provide the service required as we face demographic changes, it is in our own interests to ensure that we use such people as fully and effectively as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady referred to staff involvement, which is an important matter that has been raised by the staff side on the Whitley Council. I am pleased to tell the hon. Lady that it has been decided that, following the training advisory board's quarterly meetings, the director of personnel will meet the staff side of the Whitley Council. I understand that everyone involved is enthusiastic about making full use of that opportunity, and we welcome the work that has been carried out. I pay special tribute to Ada Maddocks, the secretary of the staff side, who attended her last meeting on Monday of this week and will retire in September. She has been involved in many of the equal opportunities initiatives that have been taking place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell the hon. Lady that in 1991 the NHS training authority budget was about £15 million in total—comprising £7·5 million in general funding and £8 million from the management executive specifically for finance and information technology. The director of personnel is currently agreeing a work plan with the training directorate, so it will not be possible to make public the financial issues until that work plan has been agreed. We are determined that training should be not bolted on but built into a high quality service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked how training shall be secured in the internal market. The ring-fenced, top-sliced money that will be available to the regions will ensure that proper recognition is given and that a coherent plan exists for the professional training that is so essential. That is the first time that such recognition and particularly identified money has been made available. It is for the provider units, in carrying forward the quality initiatives that they seek, to recognise the importance of training. Good employers know that it is essential to invest in the work force to ensure that they can operate to the best of their ability and are trained to use new equipment and technology. I refer to all the initiatives that we discussed to improve patient care, including better management of out-patients departments, appointments systems, quality management initiatives, and soon. Every time we discuss better services for patients and when we examine the implementation of care in the community in detail in the next few years, we must consider the skills of our people. We are a people driven service and any good employer will invest in those people to ensure the quality that is increasingly explicitly required in contracts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In formal terms, the management executive will review the regions' plans for training, which will be material to the contracts between the purchasers and providers to ensure that it is possible to deliver those quality requirements which, for the first time, will be set out in contracts. That is one of the great advantages of having such contracts. Similarly, NHS trusts will want to ensure that they are flagships and centres of excellence to secure patient flows and to build and develop their work. I believe that the hon. Lady is misunderstanding the matter when she compares it with the private sector. Like all other parts of the national
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
health services, NHS trusts will be required to participate in and be able to apply for the particularly identified top-sliced money available for professional training. Therefore, for example, on junior doctors' hours they will have to comply with those requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have satisfactorily dealt with the key points raised by the hon. Lady, apart from her final comments about the role of women in the national health service. She knows that we have an initiative within the NHS to identify the part played by women to emphasise the importance of using their skills and resources to the full. We are considering the work of nurses to ensure that there are more flexible rotas, launching returner and retainer schemes, and examining the role of doctors to ensure that there are more women in senior positions. We have quadrupled the number of part-time registrar posts, which is the point at which we lose women doctors. We have engaged in initiatives with the Whitley council to improve the position of women through career break schemes and the introduction of leave for family reasons. We hope soon to reach an agreement on child care vouchers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all professional groups, the Government are determined to build in proper recognition of the role of women. Recently, we invited Dr. Sue Goss to produce a document that will be the basis of a further good practice manual for the NHS and I have written to all the regions asking for one of the members of the regional health authority to take a special interest in the role of women within the NHS. I am pleased to advise the Committee that the head of the personnel development unit at the management executive is a woman, Pam Hurley, as is the training director.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have been able to assure not only the hon. Lady but all the staff within the health service that the Government fully recognise that, if we are to provide quality of care and retain the staff that we need for the future, we must invest fully in the training of those who dedicate their lives to the health service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.57 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to take up a couple of points made by the Minister. I am not clear what the specific mechanisms will be to ensure that the principles that she expounded and I fully support will be put into practice. She appeared to leave it at "Hospitals will want to be good employers and to have a trained work force." However, she stopped short of telling the Committee whether there were any practical ways in which she could ensure that they would play their part in retraining existing and older workers and training the next generation of workers. The matter seemed to be left on the basis of optimism and, given the importance of training, that is not good enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that opted-out hospitals "will want to ensure that they are flagships." There are two ways of being a flagship—through training one's staff or by poaching them from somebody else. The fact that hospitals will want to be excellent providers does not deal with the point of whether they will be excellent trainers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are completely opposed to the whole procedure of self-governing trusts and are committed to bringing self-governing hospitals back within the national health service when we form the Government. If I were the Minister in the present Government—God forbid that I should be in that position—I would be looking at the opted-out hospitals to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0090">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
ensure that there was a bottom line in training in every application and seeing whether training was part of their mission statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not good enough for the Minister merely to say that the Government hope that the hospitals will provide training; she must use the mechanisms available to her to ensure that it is provided. I have never come across contracts that imply that training will be part of the contract between the commissioning authority and the provider within the internal market. What will the top-sliced ring-fenced regional money be for? Will it be just for professional and management training, or will it be training for all other grades, too?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, what will happen to the staff who are now employed in the training centres previously run by the NHSTA? How long will they remain in Bristol and what will happen to the posts that are currently frozen? I should like to join in the Minister's thanks for the work carried out by Ada Maddocks of NALGO. She has pioneered women's training issues and I should hate to see the role that she has developed wither away as this group of men take over to advise themselves and other men.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to go through a number of the points that the hon. Lady made. With regard to trusts, the requirement for training is determined in the business needs of the providing units. In essence, if trusts do not train their staff, they will not be able to fulfil their business plans. Purchasers will wish to satisfy themselves that the staff providing the service are suitably trained. Regions have a responsibility to monitor purchase plans and their implementation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is in a sense a further safeguard, because a chief executive of a trust is on the training advisory board. The ability to deliver on business plans is clearly the lever to ensure that training takes place. In the same way, the purchaser authorities will want to be assured about the satisfactory completion of the terms of the agreements that they establish with the provider units. We have in the past emphasised strongly the special skills required by the purchaser authorities and the levers involved in the establishment of contracts to improve patient care. We will continue to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regional review process will ensure that the regions give training proper attention. Working paper 10 and the top-sliced money is for the professional training of nurses, occupational therapists, chiropodists, pharmacists, scientific officers, speech therapists, dieticians and all those other essential workers who are so fundamental to the delivery of patient care. I would be the first to say that it is
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
the task of ensuring that the whole range of staff in the health service are properly and appropriately trained that is so important for the training directorate. That is why it is coming within the mainstream to be answerable to the management executive so that we can ensure that it carries out that important work. The establishment of vocational qualifications within the health service and the development of skills are all to do with ensuring that we use our people to the full.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have been able to satisfy the hon. Member for Peckham. We are quite clear that this is a force for good and we are sure that we can achieve the aims of the NHS more objectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have always made it clear that we wanted the staff formerly at the training authority, who number up to 225, to experience as little disruption as possible. We think that we have achieved that through an understanding with the South Western regional health authority which from 1st April acted as their formal employer. Thus their NHS terms and conditions, their seniority and pension rights remain completely unaffected by the change. For the foreseeable future staff will continue to operate from the Bristol headquarters and the training centres in Bristol and Harrogate. Their position is quite secure. Like every other part of the health service, they will continue to grow to develop and to evolve. Their task will always be to provide high quality training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have attended a great number of functions and events with the staff from the training authority. I went to their convention in Bath last autumn and I launched the vocational qualifications initiative. In the youth training work and in a number of other areas I have been impressed by the enthusiasm for carrying forward that work. There will now be even more within the mainstream.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the great interest expressed by hon. Members in the work of training in the health service I should like to give the Committee an undertaking that at the end of the first year we shall provide a report of the work so that people can see the progress that has been made and the plans for the future. We must ensure that all our intentions, hopes and aspirations for the full and effective use of training and the training directorate are matched by reality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
