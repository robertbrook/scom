	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do report to the House that the Committee has considered the matter of the National Health Service in Scotland.</p></blockquote>
The health service in Scotland is as much about health as about treating sickness. The quality of our national health service springs directly from the staff who are involved in it. They account for about three quarters of the expenditure on the service. If the staff are prevented from giving of their best, the quality of care will suffer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The task for the Government and, indeed, for all of us is clear. It is to ensure an effective management structure within the health service and to ensure that it has the resources needed to achieve what is expected of it. Our task is also to ensure that staff are motivated to give of their best, that they have the information that they require, that they have the skills that they need, and that they are free to get on with the job. That is central to the health service reforms. All boards will be required to draft local health strategies, which will provide a rigorous analysis of the needs of the population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past, health boards have been distracted by the minutiae of management of day-to-day affairs in hospitals. The boards' task is now to achieve the best possible health care for the populations whom they serve. That means negotiating service agreements with providers and monitoring performance. For the first time in the health service, standards of quality of service will be set down and there will be the means, through contracts, to ensure that they are achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fundamental part of the reforms is the separation of the providers from the purchasers' role. That ensures that services are determined by need, that resources are used effectively and that quality and performance are monitored from the top of the service to the bottom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, it is important that staff should have the information that they need and freedom to act. Part of the information-gathering process, which is essential to ensure quality of care, is the introduction of medical audit. That is central to our NHS reforms. Medical audit means that doctors work together to identify the treatments that benefit patients most, as well as those that have little or no known benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, the Lothian surgical audit has been carried out in the main specialties over 20 years. All surgeons have taken part in that audit and, because of their efforts, death rates have been significantly reduced. In cases of cancer of the large bowel, there has been a reduction of nearly one third in perioperative deaths; where seven died before, only five now die. In gall-bladder surgery, the death rate has been almost halved; where 167 deaths would have been expected in Scotland, only 97 have occurred in a recent three-year period. Seventy lives have been saved. That is an outstanding example of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2</span>
collaboration, and we are now funding its extension beyond Lothian and the south-east of Scotland to Tayside and Grampian.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hospitals in Greater Glasgow are developing their own parallel systems on a slightly different but compatible basis. We can look forward to gains similar to those already achieved in Lothian being repeated throughout the country. Indeed, we now have about 550 audit projects in Scotland, which are investigating variations in quality and encouraging changes in clinical practice to secure better care and use of resources. I should like audit to be extended to nurses, dentists, pharmacists and clinical professions. We have provided £5 million of additional resources this year to finance an expanding programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If performance and quality information is being gathered, what of the freedom to act? That brings us to the importance of NHS trusts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monklands, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to Greater Glasgow and implied that communities might be involved in the audit. Is he aware that, following proposals by the Greater Glasgow health board to close Stonyetts hospital and Birdston hospital in my constituency, we had one of the biggest public meetings in our history at Moodiesburn, at which some distinguished people were present? When a secret ballot on both hospitals was held, 270 people voted against the board's proposals and no one supported them. Those people know about genuine community care and the problems of the elderly, the vulnerable and the mentally ill. Does the Minister agree that their opinions are important?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seems to have got into a muddle. As I understand his party's position, which I agree is absurd, it is in favour of ballots being used to determine whether NHS trusts go ahead, but it is against ballots being used to determine whether hospital closures should go ahead or whether there should be changes in service provision. I imagine that the hon. Gentleman's Front Bench would tell him that ballots are not an appropriate way of deciding whether a hospital should be closed. That is what the hon. Gentleman implied when we last discussed these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question about the particular hospital, the hon. Gentleman knows that the board is consulting on those matters, which will have to be referred to the Secretary of State. I assure him that there will be a consistency of approach in considering this closure proposal, as with NHS trust proposals. We shall consider what is in the interests of patient care and what will result in the best quality of service for patients. Greater Glasgow health board's plans are to provide better facilities in the community for patients, and should be judged on that basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
NHS trusts allow boards to concentrate on commissioning and planning, and allow hospitals to concentrate on organising and delivering care. They allow for decisions to be taken locally, without reference to the board or—dare I say it—to the Scottish Office Home and Health Department. By opposing trusts, the Opposition advocate more bureaucracy, greater inflexibility in pay, more oversight, more remoteness of decision making and, consequently, delays for patients and delays in expansion and innovation in the service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The British Medical Association, characteristic of a trade union—	<i>[Interruption.]</i>—as indeed it is, without arguments to put forward, has been reduced to running a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0345">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>3</span>
disgraceful campaign of scaremongering. The Labour party, which cannot see a trade union position without having the immediate urge to agree with it, has fallen into line and abandoned the interests of patients. The reason why the BMA is against NHS trusts is that NHS trusts will be able to reach local agreement with staff about pay and conditions, and there will no longer be a role for the national pay negotiators, the BMA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is placing great emphasis on this issue. Can he tell the Committee, at the outset of its deliberations, the exact sum being made available by the Scottish Office Home and Health Department and the various health boards to investigate the possibility of opt-out status for the units that are considering it? A great deal of money is being spent on the issue, and that money could be used to employ additional staff in the NHS.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that if the hon. Lady examines her files she will see that I have answered written questions from her and other hon. Members which set out the exact figures. If she wishes to table a question about the addition, I would be happy to answer it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady cannot have it both ways. She has argued that NHS trusts will divert resources from patient care, and at the same time, she argues that money has been spent on promoting the trusts. That money is additional to the money provided for patient care. We believe that NHS trusts will result in local decision making, enhanced quality of patient care and better value for money. We seek to enhance the quality of patient care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady shakes her head. Not long ago, she said to me that the Grampian health board did not understand and was not aware of the local needs of Moray. She argued that it had not taken account of the need for a specialist maternity unit, for which the local people had a better feel. Why, then, is she so opposed to the opportunities that NHS trusts will provide? Services in her area will be determined and run locally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Garscadden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a familiar Tory charge against the Labour party that it is instinctively in favour of everthing said by a trade union. It is an equally serious charge to say that a Minister is instinctively opposed to everything that a trade union such as the BMA says.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister say a word or two about his suggestion that pay agreements will no longer be relevant? Is he saying that a trust—for instance, at Foresterhill or South Ayrshire—will not be bound by the national pay agreements which, as I understand it, will still be made?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am absolutely astonished that the hon. Gentleman asks me that question at this stage. We have made it clear from the start that NHS trusts will be free to negotiate their own terms and conditions. We have also made it crystal clear that, when people transfer to NHS trusts, their existing terms and conditions will be protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members must be aware of complaints from consultants that they cannot get medical secretaries and that appointments are delayed because they cannot get letters typed. That is because medical secretaries are paid according to the Whitley terms and conditions. NHS trusts will be free to pay more if they wish to attract the staff
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
whom they need. [HON. MEMBERS: "Unless."] Hon. Members say, "Unless." I have already made the point that existing terms and conditions will be protected. Less will be spent on the administration of the health boards and more decisions will be taken locally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said that I disagreed with everything that the BMA said. I do not. I support its enthusiasm for medical audit—I have explained the importance of medical audit. In the past few years, the BMA has made a number of assertions about our reforms that have proved to be utterly false. NHS trusts will remain part of the health service. Their services will be free at the point of delivery. The boards will be able to secure services for their populations and, where the NHS trusts are providing, those services under contract, the range of services will be guaranteed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has reserve powers of direction to direct NHS trusts to provide particular services. We have had three applications to date. We have set a target of two by April next year. Foresterhill in Grampian will go out to consultation today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
NHS trusts will be able to decide what is in the patients' interest. The hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) said that he favoured ballots. The Labour party's position is absurd. It is against ballots for hospital closures or services changes, but it is in favour of them to determine whether a hospital takes NHS trust status. The Labour party's campaign has been dishonest, to put it mildly. The hon. Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) chortles. The brand new hospital in Ayr was completed in record time, thanks to the innovation of the health board chairman, who comes in for so much criticism from the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What was the question on the ballot paper issued by the Labour party? It asked whether people were in favour of the new hospital opting out of local health board control or of it staying fully in the NHS? What a deceitful question. Every Opposition Member knows—or should know—that every NHS trust will remain part of the NHS, will operate within the NHS and will guarantee NHS patient service, regardless of ability to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) is privileged to have one of the biggest investments in the health service in his constituency—the new St. John's hospital. Let us consider the reasons that were given by people for voting against NHS trust status—not that anyone was asked that question in that area. People said that they were against NHS trust status because they could not afford to pay for the services, that less money would be available and that they would not receive the same attention. Those arguments have nothing to do with NHS trusts, but everything to do with the smears and propaganda put out by Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
NHS trusts are about devolving power down to local hospital level: giving the managers, surgeons, consultants, doctors and nurses the chance to make decisions and respond to local needs without having to look to their superiors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian Wilson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cunninghame, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to the ballots taken on the South Ayrshire proposal to opt out. Presumably he is aware that more than 90 per cent. of the medical staff who were consulted opposed the proposition. Presumably he is also aware that every test of opinion showed that more than 90 per cent. of the prospective patients opposed the proposition that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0346">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
that wonderful new hospital, built with national health service funds through Ayrshire and Arran health board, should opt out of that board's control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may be completely contemptuous of the opinion of 95 per cent. of the prospective patients. He would have it that they did not understand the question, as a result of which their answers were misguided. Is he also saying that 90 per cent. of the doctors and other medical staff who were consulted were incapable of understanding the question, and that they voted against the proposition on the basis of a false premise?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should clean out his ears. If he had been listening to my remarks, he would have heard me say that the question on which he is putting so much weight was whether people were in favour of the new hospital opting out of local health board control or staying fully in the NHS. That is a non-question. NHS trusts will not be opting out of the NHS. The tragedy is that although the hon. Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) and his colleagues clearly understand the position they have taken it upon themselves, for political reasons, to misrepresent it and to cause needless alarm among the population.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already given way to the hon. Gentleman. Opposition Members are defending doctors such as the GP in Ayr who said that he would not refer his patients to the new Ayr hospital if it became an NHS trust. His political prejudice is such that he would not send his patients to the best hospital facility in his area. That demonstrates the sort of priority that such medics place on patient care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am especially grateful to the Minister for giving way to me twice. When he referred to ballots, he was being selective. What could be more democratic than what we tried to do in our community, which was to invite local people as well as the Minister and the chairman of the health board to state their case and reach a conclusion? The Minister says that that is not consistent with our argument. However, does he not recall that time after time the Standing Committee, of which I was a member, that considered the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 made proposals about ballots? Time after time the Minister rejected our views. He did not accept even one of our amendments or new clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing undemocratic about holding a meeting at which people express their views. When the time comes, I should be delighted to hear from the hon. Gentleman the views that were expressed and the arguments that were advanced in support of the proposal and those advanced against the Greater Glasgow health board. However, decisions should be made on the basis of what is in the interests of patient care, not on the basis of a specific vote. The arguments must be considered on their merits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the problem is that the dreadful questions contained the words "opt out", I invite the Minister to consider the question posed by 	<i>The Scotsman,</i> which asked
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
merely whether people approved hospitals forming self-governing trusts; it made no reference to opting out or leaving the NHS. That simple and straightforward question resulted in a 3:1 majority against hospitals forming self-governing trusts. Was the question in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> also a lie? Are not the Government determined to pay no attention to public opinion however it is expressed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is posing a question that does not arise. My criticism of the question asked in Ayr is not that the term "opt out" was used, but that it was totally dishonest and misrepresented the position. The 3:1 response to the question in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> broadly reflects support for the political parties in Scotland, and is therefore unsurprising. I assume that the hon. Gentleman's constituents are broadly representative of the people who took part in the poll in 	<i>The Scotsman.</i> A survey conducted in his constituency asked people why they opposed NHS trusts. They said that they believed that NHS trusts would charge patients. Why is that? It is because that is what the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues have been telling people throughout the country. It is quite disgraceful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: GP fund holding applies the same principle. It enables GPs to influence the way in which health care is organised and delivered, and I am keen to extend it to smaller practices. We ask boards to invite participants, and I am happy to announce today that more and more practices are eager to explore the benefits of budget holding. That is more than borne out by the overwhelming response that we have received from those who wish to participate. When we invited boards to submit bids from GP practices with list sizes of between 3,000 and 8,000 patients, we had planned a maximum of six pilot schemes. We received 33 bids—a six-fold increase. The response also shows that there is increasing recognition and acceptance that fund-holding practices will improve the quality of services to patients, despite efforts by cynics and sceptics to malign the scheme. We have decided on 12 instead of six Scottish pilots. The selection process for those 12 pilots is now under way, and I hope to announce details shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I am on the subject of general practitioners, I emphasise how successful the new GP contract, which was opposed by Opposition Members and by the BMA has been. Remember those unattainable targets. In the first six months alone, there have been spectacular improvements in the number of GPs achieving the roughest targets. In Lanarkshire, which had the highest targets for immunisation, the number of GPs achieving those targets has doubled. In Fife the story is the same—the number of GPs achieving the highest targets on boosters has doubled. In Forth Valley, the number of GPs achieving the highest targets for cervical cytology has doubled. Children are being immunised and women are being screened. That greater emphasis on health care would not have happened if we had listened to Opposition Members and the BMA.

A general practitioner wrote to me, saying that the limited drug list would mean that all his patients would be compromised in the most terrible way. He wrote to me five years later to say that the limited drug list is the most successful thing that ever happened, but that he was not in favour of the reforms. If it takes the British Medical Association and GPs five years to get it right, so be it. However, if one reads the 	<i>British Medical Journal</i> every week, one sees that the medical profession constantly changes it mind and is thoroughly unreliable about what is dangerous and what is safe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I absolutely agree with my hon. and learned Friend. Based on the BMA's record of diagnosis over the years, people are entitled to ask for a second opinion.

There has been steady expansion of the range of treatments provided by the NHS in Scotland. For cardiac surgery, we have announced an extra £3·8 million of funding to £19·8 million, and 2,900 operations will be carried out this year. That is a record number, and I am delighted to tell the Committee that agreement on that issue has now been reached with Lothian, Glasgow and Grampian. I am amazed and appalled by the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith). This year, there has been a 20 per cent. increase in funding for cardiac surgery in Glasgow. That unit is working flat out at capacity and we are investing in a new heart transplant unit which will carry out its first operations at the end of the year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The board has been given extra resources and, because its unit is working to capacity, it has made arrangements with Ross Hall hospital in the private sector for 162 patients to receive operations. It receives no thanks or praise from the hon. Gentleman. It receives only condemnation and a lot of dogma. The board is attacked for using the private sector, but that means that patients can receive treatment who would not otherwise get it because the unit is working at full capacity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I wish to talk about the waiting list initiative, because that represents another aspect in which the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden has been very active. He told us that initiative is a waste of money and argued that it is wrong to allocate specific funds to reduce waiting lists. One can imagine my surprise when I discovered in the Labour party manifesto for the last general election that precise proposal to set up a waiting list initiative with specific funds. Had I known about that, I might have had occasion to think twice. The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden is attacking a proposal that has resulted in 150,000 extra patients being treated, which appeared in his party's manifesto. He claims that it is not appropriate for the health service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government are four years behind us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that we are four years behind the Labour party. We are well ahead of it because we are setting targets for every health board in each area and each specialty which we expect to be attained. Opposition Members say that waiting lists have increased, but they do not say that they have fallen by 12 per cent. since we started the waiting list initiative, or that 150,000 extra patients have been treated. The number treated last year amounted to just over 1 million, and in 1991 there were 100,000 more. The result is that waiting times are down, so the next time that Labour Members take a sideswipe at waiting lists in the NHS, they might reflect on the effect on staff morale. The truth is that more patients are being diagnosed and seen more quickly. The NHS has never been better funded; it has £3·4 billion in the present year, which represents growth in real terms of about 3 per cent. every year. The Opposition deride that and say that the NHS is underfunded, yet the growth in funding has been, on average, about 3 per cent. a year. The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden shakes his head, but, what the Opposition promised in their manifesto, the Government have actually delivered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also presiding over the largest building programme in the history of the NHS. Last Friday, while Opposition Members were cruising around Glasgow in a charabanc waving banners and giving interviews deriding the achievements of the NHS, I was in Dunfermline topping out a £53 million hospital built under the new design and build procedure. It is the first time that a hospital of that size has been commissioned under that procedure. That major new hospital will be completed in record time—in four years rather than in 14 or 15 years

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
that it would have taken under a Labour Government. That is innovation, but people were more interested in the protest, not the achievement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Capital expenditure is up by 30 per cent.—a significant achievement. The hon. Member for Cunninghame, North may smile but, when Labour Members were in office, they cut capital expenditure by 20 per cent. between 1975 and 1977. Since 1979, we have completed 74 major projects, and 40 more are in the pipeline. I can announce another project today. I have asked Lanarkshire health board to prepare detailed proposals for a phased redevelopment of Hairmyres hospital at a cost of £48·2 million. That is the board's favoured option, and it will involve phased major redevelopment on the site of the existing hospital to provide 467 acute beds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The redevelopment will enable the health board to retain and continue to use those parts of the hospital that are already improved. The emergency wartime accommodation will be replaced and the internal ambulance transport arrangements will be almost entirely removed. It will also mean that medical and surgical facilities are substantially improved. With our other proposals, that will amount to an investment of more than £100 million in new facilities in Lanarkshire, which I am sure will be welcomed by both sides of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Adam Ingram 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Kilbride)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for informing me of that matter earlier this morning, although his letter did not mention how much money would be spent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence given by the local community and the views expressed by those who know is that the option to redevelop Hairmyres is indeed a second-best option. A new hospital is long overdue for the area with the largest population within the Lanarkshire health board area. Why is Hamilton and East Kilbride unit area getting a redeveloped hospital instead of a new one?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is that that is the board's preferred option. When I visited the hospital last week, at the request of the Opposition and others, the doctors told me that that is what they wanted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says, "Not the community", but, with a new hospital being built at Netherton and with an investment of £100 million in one area, the hon. Gentleman should give some credit to the board. I cannot think of another board in Scotland that has two projects running concurrently on such a scale. It has done extremely well to bring those proposals together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall add to the Opposition's gloom by giving another good news announcement in respect of the ambulance service, in which we have made substantial investments. We shall be providing £3·2 million for an information technology system. That latest investment will enhance the service's efficiency. It will be of particular benefit in the planning, scheduling and provision of patient transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have made good progress in their stewardship of the health service. We have provided more staff, better facilities, a wider range of treatments, effective management, a modern information system, record pay levels, more patients being treated, falling waiting times and record levels of investment for the future. That is not too bad. It is a record of which to be proud. I pay tribute to the men and women, who are the NHS, for having achieved that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
	<p>11.4 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister spoke for just over half an hour. Although he referred to the Government's record on the health service, the last part of his speech concentrated on the structure of the health service. I want to talk about the Government's stewardship of the health service during the past 11 years. Whatever the Minister says, that record has been one of underfunding and neglect. After 11 years of the Government's stewardship, the NHS cannot meet the needs of its people. In Glasgow and elsewhere, patients are queuing on waiting lists for coronary artery surgery and some die while so doing. Morale in the NHS is at rock bottom, and that is due to underfunding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of the debate has concentrated on changes to the mangement structure. However, let us consider the figures and see how much money has been spent. Under the previous Labour Government, total health service expenditure in Scotland at constant prices, allowing for NHS inflation, increased on average by 4·4 per cent. per annum. By contrast, in the past five years of the Tory Government, there has been a decrease in expenditure of 0·1 per cent. That is the reality of the Government's health expenditure. I shall repeat the figures. Under the previous Labour Government, total health service expenditure in Scotland at constant prices, allowing for NHS inflation, increased on average by 4·4 per cent. per year. By contrast, under this Government, there has been a decrease in the past five years in total NHS expenditure of 0·1 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman say what happened to health service expenditure under the previous Labour Government in 1977 and 1978?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, there was an increase in 1977 of 0·4 per cent. and, in 1978, of 0·5 per cent. A 2 per cent. increase at least is required each year to deal with the aging population and new technology.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman confirm whether the figures that he quoted are revenue or capital project figures? If they are a combination of both, how does he account for the massive cuts in capital expenditure during those years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is correct. When oil prices quadrupled, the Labour Government cut capital spending in 1976–77. However, the Tory Government cut capital spending to a far greater extent than that in 1981, 1982, 1986, 1987 and 1988, so let us have no more rubbish talked about capital expenditure. I suggest that the hon. Gentleman reads the figures before he intervenes again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A 2 per cent. increase is required each year to deal with demographic shift and the introduction of more new technology. Labour more than achieved that with its 4·4 per cent. However, the Government, with their decrease of 0·1 per cent., are the cause of the problems. That is why wards have to close, that is why hospitals shut down, and that is why waiting lists are increasing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was keen to talk about waiting lists. The most recently published figures show the in-patient waiting list at 71,077. That is greater than it was under the last full year of the Labour Government, when it stood at only 62,084. In other words, waiting lists are now greater than they were under the previous Labour Government. Hospital waiting lists have increased over the past year in the Minister's health board—Forth Valley by 12·4 per cent. That is the reality of the waiting lists; the position will not be protected by the waiting list initiative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall answer the hon. Gentleman when I have the precise figures to show how the Labour Government cut expenditure in 1977–78. I have the figures for waiting lists. In 1978 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Gentleman says that waiting list figures have gone up. The 1990 figure for waiting lists in Scotland was 58,287. I thought that I heard the hon. Gentleman say that there were 76,000 on the waiting list. The waiting list figure that we inherited was 76,968, so we have reduced it by more than 20,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister looks at waiting list figures for September 1990 in the statistical bulletin 191 from the information and statistics division of the Scottish Office Home and Health Department, he will see that table 4 shows a total waiting list for Scotland of 71,077, which is the figure that I quoted—	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is typical sleight of hand. The hon. Gentleman has included day cases in the figure, so we are not comparing like with like. What matters is that waiting times have been reduced for the health service overall, and the numbers on the waiting list have come down since 1979 under the present Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps his civil servants could provide the Minister with the table. Table 4, which relates to in-patient waiting lists at NHS hospitals in Scotland, shows a total waiting list number of 71,077. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That represents the Opposition's approach. The figure that I gave the Committee was 58,287 which was the figure for September 1990. The true waiting list number was 59,520. The hon. Gentleman quoted 71,000. He arrived at that by adding the repeat waiting list numbers and the deferred waiting list numbers. That is a typical example of how the hon. Gentleman cannot argue on the record but seeks to distort the figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do that to compare the figure with the 1978 figure. In 1988, the method of calculation was changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us examine some other figures, such as the number of nurses employed. The Government are keen to tell us of the increases. What they do not tell us is that there has been an increase in the number of nurses employed in most years since the NHS was set up. Under the previous Labour Government, the annual percentage increase in the number of nurses was 2·8 per cent. In the past five years, under a Conservative Government, there has been a cut of 0·1 per cent. The same applies to doctors. Under the Labour Government there was an annual average increase of 2·2 per cent. Under this Government, in the past five years for which figures are available, the corresponding figure was only 0·7 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recognising that they lose on the figures for input into the health service, the Government try to deflect attention by presenting the figures relating to output, but their claims are misleading. The Minister is always keen to boast about the reduction in infant mortality under the stewardship of his Government. However, infant mortality has been reduced in almost every year since the inception of the health service. Under the Labour Government it fell at an annual rate of 7·4 per cent. In the past five years under a Conservative Government, it fell at an annual rate of only 3·4 per cent. The Government are not to blame for that and I do not criticise them for it. As mortality falls, it is correct and proper that it becomes more difficult to reduce it every year and that decrease
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
becomes smaller. However, I blame the Government for claiming that the figures are better than they were under a Labour Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most important figure is the number of patients treated, and the best measure of that is the the number of operations performed. The Government make great claims about the increase in operations under their stewardship, but in most years since the inception of the NHS there has been an increase in the number of operations. Better technology techniques and medicines mean more operations and more patients treated. That is a reality of medicine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the previous Labour Government, the average annual increase in the number of operations was 3·9 per cent. During the last five years for which figures are available, the increase under this Government has been 3 per cent. That is less than it was under the Labour Government, despite all the advances in technology and changes in treatment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about the base line?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I were the Minister I would stop questioning the figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise for going through the statistics in some detail, but it is important to set the record straight. The Government's record in handling the NHS is atrocious, although they make great claims about how well they have done. Real expenditure is down and their record on the number of nurses and doctors employed, on infant mortality, and on treatment is not as good as that of the previous Labour Government. Indeed, the only increase under the Tories has been in waiting lists and bureaucracy. that is the true picture of the NHS after their 11-year stewardship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Faced with the reality of a deteriorating NHS, in the late 1980s the Government were finally shamed into reviewing the system. Because of their ideological commitment and the straitjacket within which they work, they could not bring themselves to increase resources to deal with the basic problem. Instead, they fell back on their tired and failed solution of reorganising the NHS structure. They introduced the internal market with its opt-out hospitals and GPs' budgets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us who have had first-hand experience of the NHS are pretty fed up with managerial reorganisations. This is the third that I have experienced during my time in the NHS, in addition to many other smaller reviews. Each was hailed as the last great final solution, only to be replaced by yet another last great final solution. The Government are now reorganising the structure that they set up in 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason that the current changes, with opt-out hospitals and GPs' budgets, will fail is that, again, the Government will not face the basic problem of underfunding. Unless that is tackled, no alteration of the management structure will have any effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Government introduced the internal market, we predicted that it would have three consequences. We said that first, it would reduce patient and doctor choice; secondly, that it would increase bureaucracy; and thirdly, that it would lead to a two-tier health service. However, even we did not appreciate that our predictions would be proved true quite so quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments are no longer theoretical because we can see what is happening in England and Wales, where the internal market was introduced a year earlier. It reduces
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0350">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
patient and doctor choice—that choice is now held within the system. When I was a surgeon, a doctor could decide to refer a patient, and that patient could choose to go anywhere he wished within the United Kingdom. All that has now gone; a patient has to go where a manager has made a contract, and the cheapest place is not necessarily the best. It is not the patient following the money, but the money following the patient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The internal market also increases bureaucracy. It requires a marked increase in administrative overheads merely to run the immense paper chase that is involved. Rather than opting out of a tier of bureaucracy, the internal market, with its opt-out hospitals and budget-holding practices, creates an additional tier of bureaucracy. It shows the desperation of the Government in that those who are so committed to reducing bureaucracy should seek to improve the NHS by strangling it with red tape.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until recent changes, the NHS had lower administrative overheads than any other major commercial undertaking, and markedly lower administrative costs than the private sector. The NHS spends only 5 per cent. of its funds on administration, whereas in the United States—a market-led system—the equivalent figure is 21 per cent. Of course, the Government will not put a figure on the cost of the NHS internal market. Questions to the Scottish Office on the cost elicit no more than vague responses. The 	<i>Health Service Journal</i>—the managers' journal—says that the cost of introducing the internal market's administration is up to £3 billion and £500 million a year to run it, which is equivalent to £500 million and £100 million respectively in Scotland. That money is spent only on running the internal market; think of how many cardiac operations could be done with that money. There would be no need to find additional funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall highlight the costs more specifically. If a general practice expresses an interest in holding a budget, it will receive £16,500 by return post and, if it takes up the offer, it will receive £33,000. That is the cost of another general practitioner. Under the Tories there is a batch of computers; under the Labour party there could be another general practitioner. That is the choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We predicted that the changes would produce a two-tier national health service, but we did not predict how soon that would happen. In England, where there is an internal market, patients gain preferential access to the NHS if more money is shelled out. The Alder Hey Children's hospital in Liverpool was a classic example of where patients jumped the queue if more money was paid. Even the Government were so ashamed that they introduced regulations and guidelines to prevent that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Guidelines cannot prevent a two-tier system in the internal market because that is inherent within such a system. The internal market is a competition which, by definition, means that there are winners and losers. The winners are on the first tier and the losers are on the second tier of the NHS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall highlight the two-tier system by reading from a job description for a private practice manager at the Royal Free hospital in London, which has opted out. The fact that it is advertising for a private practice manager is a giveaway, and says much in itself. It refers to the
	<br><blockquote><p>"establishment of good working relationships with Embassies."</p></blockquote>
That is what the NHS has come to—never mind our patients, go to the embassies because that is where the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
money is. In opted-out hospitals it will be more important for a patient to come from south America than from south Ayrshire or from Grenada than from Grampian. That is the reality of the opt-out policy, and it is no wonder the changes are not wanted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the current NHS system, the filofax and the manager's time are more important than the stethoscope around the doctor's neck. It is no wonder that the most recent MORI poll in 	<i>The Sunday Times</i> shows 70 per cent. of the population of the opinion that the purpose of the internal market and opted-out hospitals was to privatise the NHS. Indeed, all the polls show that the public and medical professions are overwhelmingly opposed to the internal market, general practitioner budgets and opting out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must put our views on record for the benefit of those who are working in the national health service and, in particular, to redress the caricature, which the Minister presented, of the doctors who gave their opinion in some of the surveys. The Minister described the 90 per cent. of doctors and consultants who are opposed to opting out as either too stupid to understand the question that was put to them or, in the case of those who were bright enough to understand it, too politically biased to answer it in a way that the Minister would have liked. Does my hon. Friend agree that the caricature of stupid and politically biased doctors is abhorrent? Will he place on record our appreciation of the commitment and integrity of those doctors and others who work in the health service who have taken part in the surveys?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to place on record the thanks of the Labour party for the commitment of doctors and other staff to the health service and to patients. The staff have given priority to the patients. When the measures were introduced, I was not sure what would be the reaction of the medical profession—of which I am a member—bearing in mind that it used to be in the pockets of the Tory party. It was the Tories' lackey and it seemed to support everything that they said and did. This is the first time that it has genuinely opposed them. It is a tribute to the medical profession that it is prepared to put patients and the health of the nation before any other consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will regret the caricature that they have presented of people who object to the changes in the NHS—be it the doctors, the nurses, the ancillary staff or the population—by saying that they are too stupid to understand. That is what the Minister said. The Government constantly tell the Scottish people that they are too stupid to understand and not fit to make their own judgments or run their own system. That arrogant and patrician attitude brought them to the brink of defeat in Scotland in the last general election, and this time it will certainly tip them over the edge of the abyss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We could all be patients, so we want high-quality care delivered unformly throughout the country. We want a co-ordinated, integrated and comprehensive health service. Above all, we want a health service that puts patients first and treats them as individuals, and not as clients or groups of consumers who fit into neat packages to balance the accounts. In other words, we want a Labour Government, and that is what we will get.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) has two great difficulties with the general theme of his speech. He painted a picture of the NHS in Scotland being enormously underfunded and providing poor-quality services. He selected statistics to try to justify his arguments. That will get him nowhere because he has not dealt with two major objections and difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, most people who have to use the NHS when they or their relatives are ill recognise the enormous changes and improvements that have been made over the years; they know that the service is better than ever before. I could cite three cases of serious illness in my family in the past five years that could not have been treated 15 or 20 years ago, but which can now be treated. Patients know that the treatment that they receive is good, is up to date, and that they can be cured of illnesses that they could not have been cured of in the past. That is the real picture of the health service, and patients recognise that.

The noises made by the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden—and he should know better because he used to be in the health service—do not ring true to many people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the trouble; they do not ring true to most people. Many people have said so to me and, I am sure, to other hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second difficulty was the hon. Gentleman's theme of underfunding of the health service. He believes that no part of the NHS has enough resources, and claims that a Labour Government will put that right. People who listen to that—not me, but others—may think that because he says it, it will happen. They should listen to the Leader of the Opposition, who was put on the spot three weeks ago on a television programme, when he made it perfectly clear that the underfunding argument is not in his programme. He said that, although he would wish to improve funding in the health service who would not—he could not promise to do so until the economy had expanded to allow that. We all know what happens to economies under Labour Governments. However, even if he had not been put on the spot or admitted that point, the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett), the shadow deputy spokesman for the Treasury, made it clear that putting right what the hon. Gentleman calls underfunding in the health service is not a leading priority of a future Labour Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, in his usual charming way, has been building a house of cards on a foundation of sand. He cannot deliver because his right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition has said so; experience shows that he cannot deliver and he will be unable to do so. That is why it is wrong for him to carry on trying to mislead people into thinking that he can deliver what we all know he cannot.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must proceed, as other hon. Members wish to speak. I shall not delay the Committee, but I must reiterate the two main points that I wish to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
It is clear to those outside the immediate heated political scene that the problem in the health service at present is not underfunding. Whatever else it is, it is not that. The better use of existing funds is the overwhelming responsibility. If the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden ever has responsibility for the health service in Scotland, which I doubt, I hope that he will give all his time for the first five years to trying to achieve better value for money. It weakens all his arguments when he tries to suggest that the health service is underfunded. Funding has increased by one third in real terms in the past 10 years, so it cannot be said that the service is underfunded. There have been 74 major new hospital developments, producing 7,500 extra beds; there are 1,000 more doctors and 9,000 more nurses. An underfunded service could not have provided those improvements. An underfunded service would have had to cut such increases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not heard about nurses' pay, which has increased by 41 per cent. in real terms. The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden will not want to be reminded that, under the previous Labour Government, the real value of nurses' pay fell by 21 per cent. The hon. Gentleman cannot get away from the fact that nearly 1 million more patients were treated in 1990 than in 1979. The figures is about 900,000. During the period in which the hon. Gentleman says the health service was seriously underfunded, we have introduced enormous new programmes for dealing with AIDS, which was not a public issue at the time of the previous Labour Government. We have introduced Scotland's first heart transplant unit, the first helicopter ambulance service and health education boards. Added to that, there is Government help and funding for the hospice movement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That greatly underfunded service, as referred to by the hon. Gentleman, which apparently has no money to do anything, has done all those things. The hon. Gentleman weakens all his own arguments. We want to listen to him with interest as he is a former employee of the national health service, but he weakens his position with his unjustifiable complaints.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden is keen to persuade us that he would deal with so-called underfunding. It is worth remembering that in 1977–78 there was a 3 per cent. cut in real terms. He knows that that is so, and did not deny it. He did not and cannot deny that the value of nurses' pay was down by about one fifth—21 per cent., as I said earlier. He did not and cannot deny that waiting lists increased by about 50 per cent. in that period and that capital spending was cut by almost one third in real terms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden told us that he alone knew about underfunding and that he alone could put it right. He is supporting a party that desperately underfunded and cut expenditure, not because it wanted to, but because it had to. The hon. Gentleman is making background noises;

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Will you make it clear whether there is a time limit on speeches?

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is no time limit. However, I should appreciate it if hon. Members were brief, as several hon. Members want to contribute. It is for hon. Members to decide how to express themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) has just wasted 32 seconds—I timed him. My final comments relate to my constituency of Ayr. I hope that that will please the hon. Gentleman. Some time has been wasted, but I hope that the Committee understands that it was not my fault.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Minister said earlier, an absolutely magnificent new hospital has recently been built just outside my constituency in the outskirts of Ayr. About 74 new hospitals have been built in the past 10 years or so, but this one is unique in several ways. It has been built on a site for which it was not originally planned. The change of site was imaginative and has resulted in a better hospital than would have fitted on the original site. It is unique also because it is the first hospital in the United Kingdom to be built in such a short time—just over five years. It will be opened about three years after work started on the site. As members of the Committee will know, the normal time scale for hospital building is between 10 and 15 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The project was first mooted at the Scottish Office in the early 1980s. The present chairman of Ayrshire and Arran health board first suggested that it should be built so quickly, although that was considered impossible. The general view among experts who had any knowledge of hospital building was that trying to build a hospital in five years was over the top and could not be done. However, the aims have been achieved absolutely—that cannot often be said of political matters. It would be wrong to fail to give enormous credit to all who were involved with the project. Not only did they build the hospital in a uniquely short time, but they did so within budget, which was also said to be impossible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most members of the Committee will remember the awful problems with hospital building in the past. Ninewells hospital at Dundee was enormously overspent—I think, by about 50 per cent. or 70 per cent. It took more than 15 years to build, and it was not right when it was completed. The North Ayrshire hospital at Crosshouse is a jolly good hospital, but great difficulties were involved in its construction. It was the subject of an investigation by a Select Committee, which the hon. Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) chaired, and which made important comments about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new hospital is an enormous success, and a tribute to the health board, architects, builders and doctors in Ayr, who were a key factor. The medical committee agreed early in the planning stage that, when the construction of the hospital reached a certain point, all further alterations in the details would be waived so that the design could go forward. That was an extremely important factor. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will pass on from me
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
—and, I hope, from the Committee—sincere congratulations to the Scottish Office and to everyone who helped, particularly Ayrshire and Arran health board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question was raised of the future management of the hospital. That is a difficult issue if one is thinking, as I am, of which form of management would produce better services for patients and better services for my constituents. That has always been my approach. I do not regard myself as politically committed to one status or the other—I never have been. I shall collect all the letters and views I am sent during the consultation period. I shall assess them all, as will my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State when the time comes, and will write to my right hon. Friend to give him my assessment of the general views of the neighbourhood. That seems to me to be the right way to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With respect to other hon. Members, it is wrong to set out to wreck the consultation process by misleading people on the background to the consultations. That is not imagined. The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) should not laugh about that because, as a member of the health service, he will wish the correct facts to be laid before people. We cannot get away from the fact that the impression has been successfully put about—I can vouch for the fact that it is widespread because of what has been loosely said and printed—that if the hospital had trust status it would be outside the NHS. I regret that, especially as it has been deliberately arranged. I have with me a pamphlet—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> If the hon. Member for Cunninghame, North lets me make my point, I shall not waste much more of his time. The pamphlet was issued by the local labour candidate. It asks:
	<br><blockquote><p>"What would opting out mean?"</p></blockquote>
His answer is that
	<br><blockquote><p>"It would mean our new South Ayrshire Hospital leaving the NHS as we know it".</p></blockquote>
A petition is circulating in various post offices in the area, asking people to vote against privatisation of the hospital. No one suggests privatising any hospital—certainly not the one in Ayr. No one is suggesting that any part of that hospital should be outside the NHS. The other impression that has been successfully circulated—I have heard it from many of my constituents—is that they will have to pay for things at that hospital that they do not have to pay for now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rubbish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says "Rubbish." Unless he means that the people who come into my office and say that are lying, which I do not believe, I can assure him that it is true. It is a successful effort to put that idea across. If all sides can agree, perhaps even Labour Members, the Committee should be able to state that there is no proposal for that hospital or any other that opts for trust status to be outside the NHS. It is no use Labour Members looking injured; there has been a deliberate policy to put that view across. It is not true. There is no question of charges being made in such hospitals that are not made in normal NHS hospitals. There is no question of such hospitals being privatised. If the Scottish Grand Committee said that today, and if, God forbid, it was published in some of the Scots media, at least the consultation would be on the right basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party stands accused of deliberately putting forward a false background which it now denies

because it is embarrassing. It has worked very well. Opposition Members should be ashamed of themselves for that thoroughly unparliamentary activity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is appropriate that I should follow the right hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger), and I am grateful for the opportunity to do so. I have not spoken in the Scottish Grand Committee this Session, although, unlike the right hon. Gentleman, I have attended each of its sittings. We are pleased to see him present, but we know that he is in a difficult position. On the one hand, the majority of his constituents are totally against the NHS trust, and I shall come to the evidence for that in a moment. On the other hand, he is faced with the difficulty of loyalty to his Front Bench.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the tirade that we heard from the Minister—I thought that he was protesting a little too much—there was bluster and blether because there are no rational arguments in support of the NHS trust. The Minister could only resort to that sort of bluster, so the right hon. Member for Ayr has the difficulty of deciding whether to be loyal to his young friend on the Front Bench or to represent the views of his constituents properly. If he spent the amount of time in his constituency that I do in mine he would know that those views are strongly against the idea of a NHS trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As was said earlier, South Ayrshire is in the middle of a process of consultation. My hon. Friends the Members for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. McKelvey) and for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) will agree that a small, unrepresentative, self-appointed group is putting forward a proposal. No proposal would have come from South Ayrshire unless it had been stimulated by the Minister and the Scottish Office who were desperate to get people to ask for opting out on behalf of some hospitals. Through the Tory chairman of the health board, they managed to get a few people in South Ayrshire to make that proposal. However, in no way is it representative of the views of the people in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I argue strongly that the consultation process in South Ayrshire is flawed. The board is carrying out the consultation, as it is appointed to do as part of its structure, but it is fatally compromised. First, the two chief officers of the board Mr. Fyfe, the chairman, and Mr. Eckford, the chief executive—have argued strongly in public in favour of an NHS trust. It is difficult to see how they can carry out unbiased consultation when they hold those views so strongly. Mr. Fyfe and Mr. Eckford appeared at a press conference when the trust application was launched. Mr. Eckford was sitting on the platform, identifying himself with the trust, and he is supposed to be unbiased.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is wrong with that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Eckford is supposed to be unbiased. The Minister shakes his head and says that he is not supposed to be biased, but he is giving the game away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Fyfe was canvassing and trying to invite people to become directors designate of the NHS trust—the chairman of the health board acting on behalf of the trust. Mr. Donald McNeill is acting chief executive of the NHS trust, but he is continuing—full-time, supposedly—as
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
general manager of unit 2 which the hospitals come under. How can he continue to be paid out of public money for running the hospital and supposedly commissioning it and argue in favour of opt-out at the same time?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the open day of the new hospital, board premises were used, and my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) and I were astonished to see that display boards in favour of the NHS trust had been erected. Absolutely nothing about the other side of the argument was displayed, and people who were being taken around were being propagandised on behalf of the NHS trust in the new Ayr hospital.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The system for hospital closures that the hon. Gentleman's party supports has the board taking a position in favour of a closure and carrying out the consultation process. There is nothing unique in boards involved in consultation having a view and it is perfectly proper for a board to take the view that a particular application might be appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is talking about individual closures where there are strong views in the area. The issue is highly political and there is a major difference of view between the Conservative party and the rest of the people in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The board's public relations firm, Michael Kelly Associates, is also acting for the NHS trust. The newsletter produced on behalf of the board, which was recently sent to people in Ayrshire, contained propaganda about the trust. It went to every member of staff of the health authority.—	<i>[Laughter.]</i> The Minister laughs. Michael Kelly may have a Labour background, but he does not have the integrity that is needed to carry out that exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the consultation process, the right hon. Member for Ayr said that misleading propaganda was put around by Labour Members. Donald McNeill, the punative chief executive of the trust, claims that he has attended more than 100 meetings to put the case for NHS trusts. People must have heard the truth; they have had the opportunity to hear Donald McNeill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give some examples. The Ayrshire and Arran health council has recently been reappointed by the board. When I met Mr. Fyfe recently, he reminded us that it consisted of people of all political persuasions and none. It issued a press release which stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Ayrshire and Arran Local Health Council has agreed unanimously to oppose the Application made by the South Ayrshire Hospitals for Trust Status. After listening to Mr. Donald McNeill, speaking in favour of the Trust Status, the Health Council decided to listen to the other standpoint, put by Dr. John Elliot, of Heathfield Hospital."</p></blockquote>
Dr. Elliot is a consultant, so he should know something about the issue. The press release continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"After these two Meetings, the Health Council deicided at its Meeting on Friday, 21st June, 1991, that the Trust Application was not in the best interests of patients of South Ayrshire. Mr. Martin Haughey, on behalf of the Health Council siad: 'The Council, which has recently been reconstituted, has had several detailed discussions on this Trust question and it was clear that there was no support for the Trust Application.'"</p></blockquote>
That is the view of the health council, which is appointed by the board to represent the views of the people of Ayrshire. It is unanimously against the trust.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it is pathetic of the right hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) to come here today and complain about the propaganda against the trust. He has at his disposal the powers both of

a Member of Parliament and of a former member of the Government to proselytise as much as he chooses within his constituency, and he has public funds at his disposal to make information available. The Ayrshire and Arran health board has £20,000—and many would regard that as an underestimate—to propagandise on behalf of the trust. In the past few days, it has produced a full colour publication called "The Monitor". It must have been extremely expensive to produce, and it uses a large proportion of its space to proselytise on behalf of the trust.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I cannot allow such a long intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made his point well. The publication was produced by the health board and sent to all members of staff. It contains propaganda on behalf of the NHS trust. That is why we think that the health board has compromised itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have received copies of letters sent to the right hon. Member for Ayr. A letter from the Rev. Michael M. Dickie to the Secretary of State was copied to the Rev. George Younger—and to the Rev. George Foulkes, which is even funnier. Rev. Dickie is the minister of Castlehill parish church—which is not in my constituency, with its raving lefties, but in the right hon. Gentleman's constituency. he wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Despite having heard 3 speakers on behalf of TRUST STATUS we have not been persuaded that there would be any advantage to the majority of Patients over the present system…they"—</p></blockquote>
the speakers—
	<br><blockquote><p>"can only assure us of their own intentions and have no power over their successors who could then use the independent Trust Status to increase the number of Private Patients, which they would be tempted to do to gain more income."</p></blockquote>
The Minister has not taken up that point. It is a good argument, and it is exactly what would happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is obvious from the statement made by protagonists of Trust Status that there will be a great danger of less remunerative services (to children, the elderly and long-stay patients) suffering as short term, high-profile, operations will be attractive to Trust organisers."</p></blockquote>
That is what Labour Members have argued. After hearing what was said by the protagonists of trust status, the minister and the elders of Castlehill parish church have reached the same conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many bribes have been offered and promises have been made by the protagonists of trust status. The Minister frowns, but south Ayrshire has been told that it will receive more money more quickly if it has an NHS trust than if it does not. Such promises are being made everywhere. In the event, that is not likely to happen. The parish minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We were informed by one pro-Trust speaker that 'The South Ayrshire Hospital would receive a bigger share of the (financial) cake'. We believe this would be morally wrong and that we, in this area, should not benefit at the expense of people in other areas."</p></blockquote>
The consultants were bribed, yet despite their being told that they would receive much more money if they voted for trust status, the majority of them voted against it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I received a letter this morning from the convenor of the social and community concerns committee of the presbytery of Ayr. The Committee will remember what Robert Burns said about the presbytery of Ayr, and the right hon. Member for Ayr stands up against it at his peril. The letter stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Church of Scotland in Ayr Presbytery is very unhappy about the whole way this consultation process has
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
been carried out and in our debates, several and heated, there has been a conviction that no amount of reasoned argument is going to change a decision in favour of a Trust which has already been taken. It seems a huge tragedy that at a time when the National Health Service in Ayrshire should be riding high in public esteem that a venture of this sort should be allowed to sour this view to the extent it has."</p></blockquote>
My final quotation is from a letter written by Dr. Stuart Holms. He is neither a member of the Labour party nor a constituent of mine; indeed, he is a constituent of the right hon. Member for Ayr. Dr. Holms states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have found the months since opting out was first discussed probably the saddest spell in my whole life as a GP in Ayr over the past 18 years. I have seen a health care system where Consultants, GPs, Management and the Board had a relationship which was reckoned to be second to none in Scotland destroyed at a stroke."</p></blockquote>
We the Members of Parliament who live in Ayrshire and who really represent Ayrshire—can confirm that. That good relationship between the doctors and staff and the health board has been destroyed because the Minister has pressed a small, unrepresentative minority of people to go ahead with opting out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dr. Holms continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have seen personal animosity, bitterness and divisiveness take its place. I see an unproven system of health care which is unwanted and unnecessary being stuffed down our throats. I have read the South Ayrshire Hospital Trust Application and find that it singularly fails to show that a Trust Hospital would improve the health care services for patients in Ayrshire. Indeed, I find even the suggestion that we are applying for Trust Status is destroying an excellent service and feel that Trust Status if given will be the final nail in the coffin."</p></blockquote>
Consultants have voted against trust status. The British Medical Association carried out the ballot, and there was no rigging of the wording. The consultants knew on what they were voting. The Ayrshire local medical committee carried out a ballot of general practitioners, and they knew what they were voting for, and they voted overwhelmingly against trust status. Several public consultations have taken place, and those of the Labour party have been mentioned. The 	<i>Cumnock Chronicle and Muirkirk Advertiser</i> carried out its own, unbiased consultation, and it found that the public were overwhelmingly against NHS trust status. I ask the Minister and the Government to accept the views of the people and to abandon trusts, now. They are wasting time and money that should be devoted to continuing the present health service. The issue is diverting people's attention from the running of the health service in Ayrshire. As Stuart Holms and many others have said, it is causing divisiveness and bitterness within Ayrshire, which is completely unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are telling people to take part in this sham consultation because we know that if they do not, the Minister will say that the consultation took place, and no one opposed the scheme. We are telling them to voice their opposition, although at the end of the day we would be foolish to assume that a board consisting of Tory stooges will do other than rubber stamp it, or that a Minister who started this whole exercise will do other than approve it. We have said to the people of Ayrshire, and especially to the people of Ayr, that there is only one way to ensure that this unwanted trust is not imposed on the people of Ayrshire, and that is through a general election. We need a Labour Member of Parliament in Ayr and a Labour Government in Westminster.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rising as I do at noon, I am conscious of the fact that there have been only four speeches so far today, and that many other hon. Members have risen and indicated that they hope to participate in the debate. I shall observe your request for brevity, Mr. Martin, recognising that there is not a member of the Committee who could not speak at length from a constituency, philosophical, economic or political viewpoint on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am in the unusual position of starting my remarks by thanking the Minister, although I will come to the criticism later. I think that all Scottish hon. Members know that since late 1987 I have been waging a war with the Grampian health board and the Scottish Office about maternity services in my area. Without reliving that battle, suffice to say that good arguments were placed before the Minister not only by myself in my capacity as the Member of Parliament for Moray, but also by the various organisations involved in the community—and we persuaded him that action had to be taken. We very much appreciate the additional £16·1 million that is to be spent on the enhancement of maternity, obstetric and orthopaedic services in our area. The tragedy for my constituency is that it was 1991 before such an announcement was made. I wonder what my predecessor and what representatives of the health agencies in my constituency were thinking about for the past 10 years, when they evoked a policy of not rocking the boat. I say to the Minister clearly and categorically that this Member of Parliament will happily rock any ministerial boat to achieve a health service of the standard that I believe my constituents deserve and need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having placed on record my thanks to the Minister, I shall ask him some brief questions about issues relating to my constituency. Because of demographic trends in Scotland—and Moray is no exception to this—there is a growing need everywhere for improvement in geriatric and psychogeriatric patient care. In March of this year, the Muirton wing of Buckie Seafield hospital was finally opened, but 10 of the 30 beds still lie empty in one ward. As the constituency Member of Parliament, many families have written or spoken to me about the need for beds in the community, and that is re-emphasised by the general practices in the area. In its most recent correspondance to me, Grampian health board said that it would open the final 10 beds when the financial provisions allowed it so to do. What compensation is that to people in my area? When will those 10 beds finally be opened? Do I write back to concerned families and say, "Your Mum or Dad will be allocated a bed as soon as the financial situation permits?" Is that any consolation for families who are trying to cope with a parent suffering from Alzheimer's disease, or who must be locked inside his house overnight for the sake of his own safety? What consolation is it to the GPs and health visitors who know of the desperate need for those people to be allocated beds in the near future, but do not know when that will happen? Will the Minister seriously consider providing funds to enable those 10 beds to be used?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What future do the Government plan for our cottage hospitals? They serve a vital function, especially in rural communities. Some hon. Members, especially those representing city constituencies, may say that there is an emotional attachment to cottage hospitals, but their value
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
is immeasureable. They are highly personalised and extremely friendly. The staff are known to the patients and it is easy for relatives and friends to visit them. It is paramount for patients to feel part of the community despite their failing physical or mental capacities. We seek an assurance from the Minister, for all the rural communities in Scotland, that our cottage hospitals will survive and will continue to provide facilities, especially for our elderly. Many routine aspects of health care are needed locally so that people do not have to face the prospect of lengthy journeys to impersonalised hospitals in far distant places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people are concerned that facilities, especially for the elderly, are likely to be farmed out to the private sector because they are often seen as the least profitable part of the NHS and the least attractive in which to serve. I should hate services for the elderly to become so dehumanised that our parents are regarded as mere statistics, who can be shunted into the private sector or into remote institutions far removed from their kith and kin. I hope that the Government will give an assurance that the elderly will be looked after in their communities and that expenditure will be provided to protect our cottage hospitals and the existing community services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my area, the development of geriatric care has evolved into a joint venture between the health board and the private sector. At Spynie hospital, 30 beds are to be provided by the private sector and 30 by the health board. The Minister referred to negotiations for local pay deals. How does he envisage that developing when there are different sectors side by side in the same building? I hope that he will consider that point carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now deal with national issues. I raised the matter of cash being spent to investigate whether trust status should be granted. I have a simple question which should, I hope, evoke a simple answer. In his reply to my written question, the Minister said that £90,000 had been allocated by the Scottish Office Home and Health Department and the Grampian health board to the West Grampian unit to investigate its acquisition of trust status. Is that the final figure? The original figures that were given to the hon. Members for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hughes) and for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran), when they were considering the matter of Foresterhill, showed that the eventual expenditure was much higher. What is the total figure that has so far been allocated to each health board through the Scottish Home and Health Department for such matters, and how is it being monitored?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is supposed to be a great deal of consultation. So far, Grampian health board has, to my knowledge, held two private, very expensive dinners during the initial consultation period. Will it hold public meetings? Is it prepared to speak to the public? It would not share a platform at a meeting held in Elgin where, on a sunny Friday evening, 300 members of the public turned out in a packed hall to listen to the various arguments from representatives of all political parties and from Bill Fyfe of the Ayrshire and Arran health board. People turned out because they genuinely wanted to hear the arguments for and against trust status. The health boards would do better to spend their money on taking their arguments to the public in a safe and open way, rather than on bringing together in private dinner parties, small groups of people whom they believe to be influential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The opposition parties have rightly accused the Government of trying to encourage the development of a

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
two-tier system of health care. The reality is that a two-tier system already exists. The statistics clearly show what has been happening. The May edition of the 	<i>British Medical Journal</i> revealed that NHS patients requiring vital coronary by-pass surgery or angioplasty were having to wait, on average, six times as long as private sector patients from referral until investigation, and 13 times as long until the operation. I find that extremely worrying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should be remembered that the predecessor but one of the present Secretary of State for Health said quite clearly at a Young Conservatives conference that he hoped to see an increase in the private sector, with the national health service acting as a safety net. Why talk about the national health service being a safety net unless that is the Government's philosophical view? They may want to see an increase in the private sector, but it would be more honest if they said so on the record rather than playing around with the issue. Every time the issue of opting out of the health service is mentioned, there is a baying from the Government Front Benches that clearly shows that they feel sensitive on the issue. They should be more honest and open.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Extra funding of the health service is the litmus test for every political party. The right hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) spoke about the improvements in the national health service and about how diseases that were previously fatal could now be cured. He said that we need not fear our doctors because most of what we experience is curable if we ask for treatment at the right time. I am grateful to the doctors in my area who have dealt with my health problems and those of my family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is at issue is a commitment to the funding of those advances. New technologies demand additional money. Either we are committed to ending the two-tier system and ensuring that there is adequate funding, or we allow the Government to go ahead with their existing policy. My belief is that we must end such critical underfunding, which has existed since the Callaghan days of the mid-1970s. We have not reached the targets necessary to ensure that the health service advances as we would wish. Members of the Labour party in particular should either be committed to ending the two-tier system or say where they stand on the issue of funding. I watched the "Panorama" programme last night, when once again the shadow Secretary of State for Health, the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook), said that a new Labour Government would have to work within limitations, but put no firm figure on future health service expenditure. My party is prepared to say that there must be a 15 per cent. increase in real terms over a three-year period, to bring us into line with our European counterparts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Labour party, in particular, cannot have it both ways. It cannot say that it wants an enhanced national health service unless it is prepared to put its money where its mouth is. It is not good enough to say that it is one of its priorities; the main priority of society is that everyone should have access to a health service at any point in their lives when they need it.

There is concern in my constituency about the proposed closure by the Tayside health board of Meigle cottage hospital. Cottage hospitals are popular—let no one have any doubt about that—and there is supposed to be a policy directed towards keeping cottage hospitals open. I am astonished that Tayside health board wants to close Meigle cottage hospital and move two beds to Blairgowrie. Anyone who has examined the position in Blairgowrie knows that the current population growth and the expected population growth over the next three or four years mean that we shall need every bed in Blairgowrie, those two and more. Meigle is a popular hospital. The Government are right to say that the local GPs should have some say. The GPs in Alyth, Coupar Angus, Muirhead and Newtyle are unanimous that Meigle hospital must remain. I want my hon. Friend the Minister to assure me that the Government will consider the proposal in depth because it flies in the face of reality and the intended policy of keeping open cottage hospitals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate the GPs in Forfar who have put forward imaginative proposals not only for budget practices, but for an NHS trust hospital. Tayside health board has now said that it will build a new community hospital at Whitehills in Forfar. That is good news and I am delighted, but the bad news is that we shall lose the maternity services and in-patient surgery at Forfar as Forfar infirmary is now to close. I do not object to that closure; it is sensible, and it would happen anyway with the building of the new hospital. I am worried because it appears that we shall get a greatly restricted hospital. That should also be considered much more closely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want my hon. Friend the Minister to answer one direct question—is there any truth in the story that is being spread about by the Scottish National party in my constituency that the local GPs' proposal for a self-governing NHS trust hospital has put back the new community hospital by two years? That is the fairy tale that the SNP is putting round in my constituency. It is reminiscent of the tactics before the last general election of spreading lies and fairy tales—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The SNP does that in my constituency, and in other constituencies too.

It is fortunate that the debate is taking place today because the consultation process on the aplication for trust status starts today. We have three months to debate the issue in

Aberdeen. The main area on which I want to concentrate is the suitability of Grampian health board to be the agent in that consultation process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since leaving school at 16 and going to work for a public authority—the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board—I have had contact, in my various capacities, with virtually every public agency in Scotland. I have not seen actions from any public body to compare with those of Grampian health board and its various officers. It appears to have no awareness of its public responsibility or of the fact that it is a public agency with public duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A catalogue of actions by the board and its various officers renders it unsuitable to be the agent for the Secretary of State's consultation. At the outset, a working party was set up to consider the options—a directly managed unit or a trust. The working party came out in favour of trust status, by a small majority. The board then embarked on consultation with the staff. It was expensive, detailed and unsettling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The staff opposed trust status; only one department in the hospital was in favour. The unit medical advisory committee, many of whose members were members of the working party, responded to the consultation by changing its mind and voting against trust status. However, the board forgot about that. Consultation did not matter to it. It ignored the views of its staff and its unit medical advisory committee, and in March it made a formal decision to support opting out. It made it clear that it would support opting out in virtually any circumstances that met its approval. Clearly, the board prejudiced its public position as agent for consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Worse than that, there has been strange, exotic and unusual behaviour for a public agency. For example, in south Ayrshire there is a public relations officer who has forgotten that he is employed by the Grampian health board and is acting as the public relations officer for the trust. There is a flood of statements in the press from unnamed sources attacking various individuals, including myself, for statements that we have made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Shocking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course it is shocking. Those attacks were in undiplomatic language, which was surprising as they came from a public agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not just a Labour party issue, as the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) made clear, and it applies even to the Conservative party. My colleagues in the area have become used to distortion, deceit and lies. I know of one occasion recently when an officer of the Grampian health board lied to the Minister. I find that inexplicable in a public body, with public responsibilities, that deals with the most crucial public service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed chairman of the trust, Mr. Bloomfield, was a party to the decision in March to support opting out. Presumably, he was allowed to speak at that debate; presumably, he took part in and voted. I have seen the minutes. He has a direct interest in the trust, yet he supported it. The board belatedly realised the folly of its ways because last week, three months after the decision to support trust status, it decided that Mr. Bloomfield should take no part in the discussions on trust status—a wee bit late, when the crucial decision had been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another thing happened recently which struck me as very odd for a public body. My office and the local
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
newspaper were contacted when the board sent out, without a covering letter or any indication of the source, 1,000 photocopies of an article in 	<i>The Press & Journal</i> by the proposed chief executive of the new trust, supporting trust status. The article went to 1,000 carefully chosen business people who were assumed to support trust status. That is surprising. Again, there was no acknowledgement of where it came from. That was strange behaviour from a public body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Moray described how the people behind the application refused to debate publicly any aspect of it. I shared the platform at the meeting in Elgin to which she referred. I sat next to Mr. Bill Fyfe, who was shocked to find that he had travelled more than 150 miles to attend the meeting simply to discover that he was the only spokesman from any health board in Scotland. The Grampian health board would not send anyone to the meeting. On the launch date of the application we had expected a press conference, but instead we had a press release. The proposed chief executive found that he had a pressing need to visit Shetland that day and was unavailable for a press conference. The proposed chairman, Mr. Bloomfield, was tracked down to a holiday home in Ballater and he refused to give a statement because he was on holiday. Such is the behaviour that we have come to expect from the Grampian health board and the applicants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Aberdeen has some experience of what lies in store if trust status is granted. The health board built a 60-bed unit in the City hospital in my constituency. It was to house 30 geriatric and 30 psychogeriatric patients. However, the psychogeriatric patients could not be provided because the mental health unit was not prepared to have its funding cut by the sum allocated for 30 patients. Eventually, the relatives of 60 patients were advised that those patients would be transferred to the new unit, which was being run by a private firm. I am told that this was the first time that a health service facility in Scotland has been run by a private concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The nursing facilities were to be provided by an organisation called Community Health Services based in Lancashire. The first 30 patients were moved there in June, and the relatives of the other 30 patients were told to prepare for their transfer. Unfortunately, Community Health Services has not been able to recruit the necessary staff so it is now in breach of contract. Thirty patients and 30 groups of relatives had been prepared for the traumatic move, which will now not take place because that private organisation cannot meet its contract obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the future, and that is what the people of Aberdeen and north-east Scotland are worried about. They foresee the service deteriorating. The transfer of cash and the economics of running an organisation, rather than the needs of the patients, become the criteria. Much distress is being caused to those elderly patients and to their relatives, but there are no signs of remorse and I have no idea of what the Grampian health board will do. Will it call in the contract? Will it install its own staff and tear up the contract? Apparently not, because the board is trying to negotiate some way out of the mess.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has been at pains to assure us that consultation will take place. However, a massive propaganda exercise is being conducted that will render that consultation invalid. I fee a wee bit sick and tired of listening to people such as the Minister, who pretend that they know better than the professionals in the service and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0358">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
the consumers of that service. When the Secretary of State for Scotland was in Aberdeen recently, he was asked whether the consultation process would be fair. I shall quote from the report of his speech in the Aberdeen 	<i>Evening Express</i> on 2 July. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'Local opinion does matter,' he said. 'What matters more is getting the best results so people will come to realise what is being done is in their best interests'."</p></blockquote>
The Government have paraded themselves as a Government who listen. What we are hearing from the Minister, the Secretary of State and everyone else who speaks in favour of trust status is paternalism. They will listen to local opinion as long as they agree with it. That is the only criterion that they are prepared to apply. They know best. In 1979 they promised to deal with that sort of attitude, yet they are practising exactly what they criticised then. They will have to come to terms with the fact that such a view will be roundly rejected by the electorate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ray Michie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll and Bute)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is obvious that justice to such a huge subject as the national health service in Scotland cannot be done in two and a half hours, so I shall try to restrict my remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall start on a positive note, as did the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing), and pay tribute to the success of the west of Scotland mobile breast-screening service, which began its programme in Argyll and Clyde in October 1990. Since then, the average attendance in each place has been at least 71 per cent. I am sure that the Minister will be pleased about that because he made a conscious effort to get it going. I also commend the Minister on his agreement that the quite unacceptable practice of single manning of ambulances in rural areas should be eliminated. He has assured me that he is making every effort to ensure that it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have liked to have said something about hospital boards being purchasers and about hospital trusts, but time does not allow me to do so. The Minister is unable to offer any proof that the trust hospitals will function properly in delivering the services that are required locally. Until he is able to provide it, we and the people of Scotland will not believe that they will be successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) referred to low morale. One of the worst Government-induced fiascos, which borders on farce, has been the constant restructuring of the NHS. That has been a part of the scene since the Tories came to power in 1979. For sheer incompetence, it compares only with the debacle of the poll tax. The damage done to staff morale is unbelievable; it is now at rock bottom in the medical profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recently spoke to nursing staff who, as the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) said, have had to apply for their jobs for the third time in a few years. Nursing officer posts are to go, so the NHS will lose experienced nursing professionals who are responsible for co-ordination, leadership and the scrutiny of high standards. Instead, the expansion of non-clinical posts, with fancy new titles and no professional expertise, appears to be the norm. There seems to be a progressive devaluation of clinical involvement, with clinicians seen as irritants and impediments in the buying and selling of health care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a particular interest in speech and language therapy, and I welcome the Minister's response to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
recent publicity in Glasgow about the lack of speech therapy, especially for children with special needs. However, I regret that it required the outcry of parents and a campaign conducted by the 	<i>Glasgow Evening Times</i> to obtain it. In responding to the problems voiced to him, the Minister took an interest in the ways to attract speech therapists who had left to have families back into the service. He is probably aware of all the steps that need to be taken to attract them back, but there would have been no publicity in Glasgow and no outcry had the board heeded the advice given to it on the requirement for speech therapy for childen with special needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Chapter and verse of the information has been available in Scotland for a number of years. The Scottish Office Home and Health Department helped the area speech therapists to set up the data collection system. It said that it did not want the details and that the health boards might, but most of them did not want them. Certainly, managers in the speech therapy profession wanted them so that they could tell the health boards how they could run a cost-effective professional service designed to meet patients' needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am fearful that because of the changes, there will be a further fragmentation of the speech therapy service, and that we shall return to what happened pre-1974 when there was a split between education and hospitals. Since 1976, a good comprehensive speech therapy service has operated throughout health board areas. If the Government split it again, that will result in duplication and in poor deployment of resources, equipment and manpower.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the problems of Greater Glasgow pertain to other parts of Scotland. I have a letter from the parent-teacher association of Lilybank special school in Inverclyde, where the speech therapist is going on maternity leave and will not be replaced. The children have special needs that will not be met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Area speech therapists have the expertise, and all of them have been trained to manage, so why are they not allowed to manage? I should like to draw the attention of the Committee to a headline in the 	<i>Glasgow Evening Times</i> two weeks ago, which said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Vital pledge by new speech boss."</p></blockquote>
What is the meaning of that? I mean no disrespect to the individual in question. I am sure that he is an excellent person in his own area, but he knows absolutely nothing about speech therapy. Is more money to be wasted? Why cannot people understand that there is already a manager in post?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An area speech therapist, with the help of only one administrative assistant, runs the whole of Greater Glasgow health board speech therapy service, including services to hospitals, schools and health centres, a hundred times better than any manager whom one cares to produce. That is so throughout the health board areas in Scotland. What unmitigated folly and what a waste of money it is to ignore the management expertise that already exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As time does not allow me to deal with all the health care subjects that I should have liked to have mentioned, I shall reiterate my party's commitment to a comprehensive, properly funded health service of which we can all be justly proud. Whatever the Government try to say, the public perception remains that, bit by bit, they are trying to dismantle the health service. That is what the public believe, and the Minister knows it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jimmy Wray 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Provan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Listening carefully to the Minister this morning one would think that everything is rosy in the garden. He talked about a health service in Scotland and about quality, resources, skills, management, health care and standards. We know about those standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a hidden agenda to step up the privatisation process. The Minister said that the health service has the freedom to act, but it does not have the freedom to act when deciding about funding practices and trusts. The Minister went on at great length about rising targets since general practitioner contracts began, but in reality there has not been much change. Before contracts, preliminary immunisations were already at 93·6 per cent. and cervical cytology at 87·5 per cent., so there has been an increase of only 2 or 3 per cent. The most important statistic for hon. Members representing constituencies in the city of Glasgow is that pre-school immunisation has increased by only 7 per cent., from 70·6 per cent. to 77 per cent. That is a shocking result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one needs to tell Members of Parliament from Glasgow about the health service. It is not in a good state. The infant mortality rate for the east end of the city is the worst in Europe. The pre-retiral death rate is higher than in any other part of Europe for the age group between 45 and 65. The figures for terminal illnesses in the east end of Glasgow are the worst in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Screening rates are very poor. A 3 per cent. increase is not enough; it has had no effect on the death rate. More than 3,000 people die needlessly in the United Kingdom every year and hundreds die in Scotland because the Government will not make available the financial resources that are needed for cervical cancer screening to catch invasive carcinomas. We are very worried about the state of the health service in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unemployment figures have not fallen below 1·25 million since the Government have been in power, and they now stand at more than 2 million. Out of every hundred families, 12 are living in houses below a tolerable standard. That is a shocking disgrace. The Government have made no improvements. They have not laid a brick since they came into power. That creates disease and ill health. Of course, the Government must spend more on health because there are now 9 million people over 75 and there will be 1 million over 85 by the year 2001. There are 10 million living below the poverty line. That is very worrying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must look at the working hours of doctors, the morale of the health service and the use of Healthcall, the British Medical Association deputising agency. Use of that agency is running at 60 per cent. The January and February 1990 figures show 14,878 calls. The 1991 figures show an increase of 3,000 to more than 17,000 calls to the Healthcall stress line have increased from 410 to 530. That shows the effect that the Government are having on the people of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the aims of the White Paper was to encourage doctors to deputise for each other. That is why the recommendation was made to increase the payment by £11 to £33. Doctors are human beings like everyone else and they would like to work from 9 am to 5 pm like other professional and manual workers. They cannot do that because of staff shortages.

Other hospitals that the Lothian health board has on its hit list are the Eastern general, Roodlands, Simpson memorial maternity and the Eye Pavillion. The Minister is not convincing the people of Scotland, as statistics show. A MORI poll for 	<i>The Sunday Times</i> of 7 July asked to what extend people agreed or disagreed with the statement that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The government's real intention in encouraging trust status for hospitals is to privatise hospital services".</p></blockquote>
Thirty-nine per cent. of those questioned tended to agree with the statement, and 31 per cent. strongly agreed. That means that 70 per cent. of people in Scotland believe that the Minister is not telling the truth. The poll asked to what extent people agreed that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The NHS is safe in this government's hands".</p></blockquote>
Forty-three per cent. strongly disagreed, and 26 per cent. tended to disagree—a total of 69 per cent.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Marshall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Shettleston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend from the east end of Glasgow for giving way. He does the Committee and the country a service by drawing attention to the lack of resources and to the way in which money has to be raised to buy equipment. Does he agree that it is an absolute disgrace that the Shettleston health centre in the east end of Glasgow had to rely on the generosity of the Heinz food company, which presented the centre with a vital piece of equipment to test the hearing and speech abilities of very young children? The area represented by my hon. Friend is very similar to my constituency, where many young children suffer from asthma and hearing diseases as a result of damp housing conditions. Is not it an absolute disgrace that health centres have to appeal to private companies for essential equipment that should be provided, by right, by the national health service and the Scottish Office?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. He has done much research into the matter. It is an absolute scandal that the Government have turned the health service into a begging-bowl society. The 	<i>Sunday Scot</i> said that mental patients were sleeping rough—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rubbish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says, "Rubbish," but the story was on the front page of the newspaper. We know that such patients are being dumped out of hospitals, and sleeping rough. The Minister must know about it. He does not have sufficient funds to provide care in the community. Before people are put out into the community the Minister should make sure that they receive at least one visit a week from a social worker. The Minister should liaise with local authorities; he should not be asking health boards to say, "Right you are, we'll close this down," and dump 500 patients. However, that may happen in Gartloch if the Glasgow health board gets its way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am running out of time. I wrote my speech to last an hour, and I will have to throw half of it away. If the Minister honestly believes that the people of Scotland and the people of Britain do not think that opting out is the foundation stone for the privatisation of the health service, he has another think coming. It is a question of democracy versus ideology. A two-tier system will be created: the rich versus the poor. The Minister is the richest man in my constituency, or rather he is the second richest, because the Minister has already claimed that I am the richest, as 	<i>Hansard</i> reported.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The funding practices will not help ill people in Scotland. People will be shunted from Land's End to John O'Groats in order to get the cheapest form of health service. If 1,000 general practitioners in Scotland have been thinking about the new scheme, surely there have been more than 46 inquiries. The Minister tells us that there have been 12 applications. That is not very many. When the Labour party is in Government, we will allow your funding practices and your opting-out of the health service to rot. We will dump them in the rubbish bin, where they belong. The first wave of opted-out hospitals is nothing to brag about. Do you honestly think that Guy's hospital is an example of a flagship—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not wish to interrupt the hon. Gentleman in full flow, but it appears that he is accusing me of things, and not the Minister. I do not mind him accusing the minister, but I mind him accusing me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister cannot be telling us that Guy's hospital is an example of a success. It has a budget of about £228 million, and in its business plan it stated that it hoped to make a profit of £1·5 million, yet it ended up with a deficit of £7·5 million and sacked 600 people. Is that what we are about to see in Scotland? Will the proposals mean that people will finish up on the dole? People who belong to such a caring, compassionate service deserve more than the Government are prepared to offer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.52 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Clydesdale—	<i>[Interruption.]</i>—forgive me, the hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan, (Mr. Wray), on his speech. I should have taken the clue from the reference to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Provan set out very well the Labour party's position on the health service. That position seemed to be based on a series of statistical inaccuracies and on paranoia about the Government's policies. The hon. Gentleman said that the Government had not contributed to one single brick being put on top of another for housing in Scotland. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton), tells me that 40,000 public sector houses have been built, partly through Government support for housing associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Provan described the improvements in immunisation in Glasgow as not very impressive. Opposition Members had told us that the targets could not be reached, yet in several parts of the country the number of doctors who have reached the targets has doubled. The hon. Gentleman's contribution, as a Member of the Opposition, in discussing the investment in the health service was to parade several stories that had appeared in newspapers and which gave no credit to the £100 million investment for Lanarkshire, which we have announced today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) reminded me of a second-hand car salesman busily adjusting the clock to make his record in Government look better. The figures are challengeable. I asked the hon. Gentleman about expenditure for 1977–78 and he said that it went up. Total NHS expenditure, capital and revenue, fell in real terms, if one considers the GDP deflator for Scotland. Admittedly, the largest slice of that came from savage cuts that were made in the hospital building programme. As the hon. Gentleman will know, the number of people on waiting lists in 1987 was 81,324 and the latest provisional figures show that it was 59,909 on 31 March 1991. That is a substantial reduction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More relevant, waiting times have shortened considerably. When the Labour party left office, mean waiting time for specialty treatment in Scotland was 67 days. It is currently 63 days. I agree that there is more to be done, but the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden cannot get away with massaging the figures to make an abysmal record look only poor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) said that the speech of the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden did not ring true. He said that it did not ring true in his constituency experience, and it doese not do so in mine. The biggest consumer survey ever conducted in the history of the NHS, in which about 4,000 people who had recently been in hospital were interviewed, showed that 95 per cent. were satisfied or fairly satisfied and 70 per cent. were very satisfied with the NHS. That is the test that counts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jimmy Dunnachie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Pollok)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why change it then?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because we intend to continue to make substantial progress in improving patient care throughout the health service. My right hon. Friend the Member for Ayr—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunnachie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where is he?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend apologises as he is unable to be here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Ayr also pointed out that the Ayr hospital had been completed in record time, at which Opposition Members cheered. It was completed in record time because the chairman of the health board, Mr. Bill Fyfe told the Department that it would be much better if those decisions were taken at local level and if the health board had the freedom to be innovative at local level. Everyone said that that could not be done, but it was done. That is why my right hon. Friend is now telling his constituents that if the hospital becomes
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0361">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
an NHS trust the principles of taking decisions at a local level and of not being second-guessed will deliver better patient care more quickly, just as we delivered the hospital of greater quality more quickly by applying those principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) seems confused. Let me put it clearly. The decision on NHS trust status will be taken not by the health board but by the Secretary of State. It would not be improper if the health board favoured the reforms. Indeed, it is the health board's job to obtain the best deal for patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) for her kind remarks about the hospital. I assure her that I share her views on Scottish hospitals; for example, the major investment that we have made in Crieff and in Peterhead. We shall allow private sector involvement in care of the elderly only when it will improve that care and provide better value for money. I take great interest in the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
hon. Lady's commitments to increase expenditure by 15 per cent. in real terms. According to my calculations, before allowing for inflation, that would put about 4p on income tax in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) mentioned the Meigle hospital. I assure him that I shall consider his point carefully. He asked me whether the community hospital for Forfar had been delayed as a result of the NHS trust proposals. It has not. No decision has yet been taken, but I am sure that his representation for a community hospital will be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall write to other hon. Members whose points I have not been able to cover in my short closing speech. The health service is not only safe in the Government's hands but is prospering and flourishing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
