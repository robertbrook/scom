	<div class='legislation'>Draft High Court and County Courts Jurisdiction Order 1991</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General (Sir Patrick Mayhew)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That the Committee has considered the draft High Court and County Courts Jurisdiction Order 1991.</p></q>
May I say, Mr. Hill, that the Committee is glad to have the benefit of your kindly advice for what I hope will be reasonably short proceedings?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of the draft order is to achieve a better match between the weight or importance of a case and the level of court in which it is litigated, which is important to provide people who use the law with a service that meets their needs. The order will not do all of that at once or on its own, but it will be a first step—and an historic one—towards making access to justice simpler, quicker and more convenient. That is an aim that we all share.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. and noble Friend the Lord Chancellor seeks to make the order under powers conferred by section 1 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990. That section is about the allocation of court business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The substance of the order draws on some of the central conclusions and key recommendations of the civil justice review, which was set up in 1985 to recommend improvements to the machinery of justice in England and Wales and, in particular, to reduce delay, cost and complexity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The civil justice review found that relatively few cases handled in the High Court were of sufficient weight or complexity to warrant the specialist judicial and other resources available there. It recommended that those resources be reserved for public law cases, such as judicial review, other specialist cases and general list cases of importance, complexity or substance. By transferring other cases to the county courts, litigants will have the benefit of quicker, more accessible and more informal procedures and, at the same time, the High Court will be freed to deal more expeditiously with the cases that are appropriate to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. and noble Friend the Lord Chancellor has consulted senior members of the judiciary, as required under the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990. There were two public consultations in the spring and autumn of 1990 on earlier drafts of the order. Many helpful points were made by those whom my right hon. and noble Friend consulted, including the Law Society and the Bar Council. They played their part in shaping the final order. My right hon. and noble Friend is extremely grateful to all those who helped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 2 will take the historic step of abolishing the jurisdictional limits of county courts for non-specialist classes of case. The pecuniary ceiling of £5,000, which has been in force since 1981, will now disappear in respect of actions that form the bulk of county court work —debt,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
housing and personal injury actions. For the time being, the capital value limit of £30,000 for equity and probate matters will remain, as will some other limits under specific statutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Provisions in articles 4 to 6 govern the level of court in which proceedings must or may be commenced. Where both the High Court and the county court have jurisdiction, the plaintiff may issue proceedings in either. There are two exceptions, the first and most important of which relates to actions for damages for personal injuries where less than £50,000 is involved. Those actions will have to be commenced in a county court. The second exception applies to the audit of accounts provided by public bodies under part III of the Local Government Finance Act 1982. The proceedings specified in article 6 of the order must be started in the High Court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third significant group of provisions is set out in article 7, which deals with the allocation of proceedings for trial. It establishes that where the High Court and the county court both have jurisdiction an action may be tried in either court. It also introduces minimum and maximum values of claim, which will determine whether the trial will be in the High Court or the county court. However, those indications are not rigid or mandatory. They may be overridden by criteria set out in article 7(5), and between the indicative limits there is a band within which the appropriate forum for trial is determined, by reference not to value but to those criteria alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are those indicative limits? The upper limit placed on county court trial is £50,000, so that actions worth £50,000 or more will normally proceed in the High Court. The lower limit placed on High Court trial is £25,000, so that actions worth less than £25,000 will normally proceed in the county court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The criteria that I have mentioned are broadly those suggested by the civil justice review. Financial substance is the first, but that must be considered in the context of the other criteria. Importance is the second. The judiciary have a good deal of experience in recognising the degree and nature of importance of a case that will merit trial in the High Court, but the order gives a steer by mentioning
	<br><q><p>"questions of importance to persons who are not parties or questions of general public interest."</p></q>
The third category of criteria is complexity—of the facts, legal issues, remedies or procedures involved. Last is the consideration of where the trial is likely to be disposed of more quickly. But that consideration must not on its own determine the forum for trial.
Articles 9 and 10 comprise the remaining provisions that are new or significant in the order. They introduce a new approach to determining the value of an action for the purpose of the commencement and trial provisions. Essentially, the approach is to use
	<br><q><p>"the amount which the plaintiff or applicant reasonably expects to recover".</p></q>
It will apply to different types of case in the following way. It is fairly straightforward where there is a liquidated claim for a known sum of money. The amount that the plaintiff reasonably expects to recover is that known sum. Where the monetary claim is unliquidated as it is known in the trade—for example, in damages for personal injury where the plaintiff does not claim a specific sum—the order discourages the plaintiff from overvaluing the claim by requiring that the expectation must be reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0061">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
However, the principle must be expressed differently where the action is for specified relief other than a sum of money—for the recovery of land, for example, or to restrain a nuisance such as noise. The formula is:
	<br><q><p>"the amount of money which the plaintiff or applicant could reasonably state to be the financial worth of the claim to him".</p></q>
Provision is also made for circumstances where such actions have no quantifiable value. The appropriate forum for commencement and trial will then be detemined by reference to the criteria set out in article 7(5).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, article 12 provides that the order has no application to family or Admiralty proceedings. A separate regime for some family proceedings will come into effect under the provisions of the Children Act 1989 on 14 October 1991. In debates on clause 1 of the Courts and Legal Services Bill anxiety was expressed as to whether the county courts could cope efficiently with the additional burden of work currently dealt with in the High Courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we are closer to making these fundamental changes it will be helpful for me to make several points. First, my right hon. and noble Friend the Lord Chancellor has consistently stressed that the major programme of reform that he has undertaken—of which the order is a part—will be implemented only at a pace that the court service can accommodate. That is one reason why, for example, the single point of entry now proposed for personal injury cases up to £50,000 is not replicated in the order for the other classes of case that the civil justice review recommended—debt and housing. It is also why the order does not abolish all the jurisdictional limits of the county courts, but retains for the moment those in equity and probate matters, among others. The operation of the changes that the order makes will be carefully monitored by my right hon. and noble Friend the Lord Chancellor before further orders are introduced under section 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, staff provision in the court service as a whole—and I am referring to staff in post—has been increased in the current financial year by more than 400 compared with November 1989. Additionally, the complements of district judges, as registrars are now known, and circuit judges are to be increased for 1992 by about 18 in each category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, measures already taken by my right hon. and noble Friend to improve the management and efficiency of the county courts are bearing fruit. In particular, the computerised summons production centre at Northampton has, for over a year, been issuing summonses within 24 to 48 hours of receipt. By the end of February 1991, the centre had issued 965,000 summonses. The resulting saving in staff time has released the equivalent of 50 full-time staff for other duties in the courts. An even greater saving, of about 300 to 350 full-time members of staff, has been made as a result of the county court rule changes in April 1990, which curtailed the courts' banking function. Until then, debtors in county court cases were required to pay to the courts sums due under most judgments or orders. They now pay creditors directly, except where the court needs to know that a payment has been made—under a warrant of execution or an administration order, for example. Again, the staff time saved has been used to improve efficiency and take on new work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
Fourthly, there are 72 trial centres now in operation—and four more planned to open shortly—where longer cases can be heard without lengthy adjournments, the bane of the county court practitioner and litigant. That has substantially improved waiting times in the county courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Rowlands 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a combined county court and Crown court in my constituency and I am interested in staffing. Do the 400 staff in post, to whom the Attorney-General referred, meet existing duties and responsibilities or were their posts created in anticipation of the new duties? Are more posts necessary to enable the order to work effectively?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They were employed to meet the demands of existing work. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising that as it leads on to my next point. Much of the work is to be done by the same people, because the High Court district registries have been located alongside the county courts and will employ the same staff. Much work will come down from the High Court and will need additional staff; anxiety has properly been expressed about the delays that we have at the moment—indeed there were some a year or so ago—and 400 extra staff have been taken on since November 1989. That is a big advantage and an encouraging development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the additional burden on the county courts that results from the changes in the order will be far less in practice than many people suppose. Since 1988 the senior judiciary has been transferring a considerable volume of cases from the High Court to the county courts under practice directions. The order builds upon that helpful initiative and tackles other matters that need to be on a statutory footing and cannot be left to practice directions. Current estimates are that the number of additional cases coming to full trial in the county courts in any one year will be about 1,500 to be spread among more than 70 trial centres. A large proportion of the extra proceedings that are issued in, or transferred to, county courts but do not come to trial will be handled by the same staff and in the same offices because the district registries of the High Court occupy county court offices in the provinces. Although that does not apply in London, cases that would have been handled by the central office in the Royal Courts of Justice will be shared between 18 county courts in inner and greater London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise for going on rather long, Mr. Hill, but I wanted to give a fair picture of the effects of the order without being unduly technical. The order gives substance to a policy which found considerable favour when it was discussed in debates on part 1 of the Courts and Legal Services Bill. I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.46 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Fraser 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Norwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Attorney-General knows that we welcome the extension of the jurisdiction of the county court. During the passage of the Courts and Legal Services Bill, we were worried about whether the county courts would be able to cope. I am glad that the Attorney-General has directed his attention to that and I hope that adequate extra staff will be provided. When the number of staff allocated is averaged out to extra staff per court, it is not that large. We shall reserve our judgment until we see how the courts cope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0062">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
I welcome the attention that the Attorney-General has paid to the matter and the emphasis that he has placed on trial centres. The inability to obtain continuous hearings in a single place is a major problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I received a letter only yesterday from south-east Cornwall constituency Labour party which illustrates the problems of delay. It says:
	<br><q><p>"The case was adjourned for 'directions' and subsequently the judge had to deal with a social security case which meant that the people on both sides of the divorce case were kept waiting".</p></q>
That delay added an extra two hours' costs to the claimant's bill which has greatly upset him. That is not a major issue and I do not expect the Attorney-General to comment on the case, but if someone in a small divorce case feels put out about incurring costs for two hours because he is not on legal aid, how much more injured will people feel if they have to waste a whole day? The worst thing of all is to get to court only for the case not to come on. We cannot over-emphasise the importance that we attach to these matters. We shall reserve judgment and see how things work once the order is in operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I am not straying out of order, but one of the proposals in the civil justice review, which was foreshadowed by our debates on the Courts and Legal Services Bill, was to increase the small claims limit in the county court from £500 to £1,000. I thought that provision would be made for that in the order, but it is not because, I understand, that it can be made only by rule, which is subject to a negative resolution, rather than by order. However, it is proper to raise the matter as it must have formed the subject of consultation and is inextricably linked to the other changes in the order. When will that change be implemented? Will it be at the same time as the changes in the order?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Attorney-General will know that civil law practitioners have expressed grave reservations about the possibility of personal injuries actions being dealt with in the small claims courts. There are problems in getting medical reports and assessing the measure of damages for what may be a minor injury in financial terms but which may be of major importance to an old-age pensioner who has been knocked down on a zebra crossing. Such people might feel, or be, disadvantaged if their case for personal injuries damages of under £1,000 is, effectively, to be dealt without legal aid and without any resources to obtain a medical certificate. That must have been discussed as it fits in with the rest of the order. How will that aspect of the extension of the jurisdiction of the county courts be dealt with?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order provides for enforcement proceedings to be dealt with in the High Court, notwithstanding that the action took place in the county court. A peculiarity of the High Court—or at least of the Queen's bench division—is that there is no court file, such as those of the divorce court or chancery division. How easy will it be to proceed with enforcement in the High Court after obtaining a judgment in the county court? Has that been thought through? Sometimes, the plaintiff or successful party will want to enforce the judgment rapidly without long delays in transferring the case from the county court to the High Court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Attorney-General aware of the outcry about the fees charged by sheriffs for the enforcement of orders for possession? Sheriffs' fees are based on the rateable value of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
premises. Those fees were reasonable when they were based on the old rateable values, but with the introduction of the new business rate they have shot up by 10 or 20 times. There is an enormous discrepancy between a bailiff's charges for possession proceedings—often against squatters—and the fees charged by private enterprise sheriffs. Has further consideration been given to those matters, especially to cases where action has been taken in the county court but has to be enforced in the High Court?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One reason why civil legal aid work in the county court is unattractive is the long delay in taxation of bills. During the passage of the Courts and Legal Services Bill, we asked whether taxation performance targets for county courts would be introduced. I receive letters from solicitors all over the country complaining about the delays in getting their bills taxed. Civil aid practitioners have to wait some time after taxation for payment. The problem is of acute importance to the financial success of a practice. Will performance targets be set? Is the Attorney-General satisfied that bills of costs presented to the county court can generally be taxed within one month of presentation to the county court?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.53 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to pursue the point that I made in my intervention about the manpower consequences of the order. The Attorney-General patiently explained that the consequences would be less than might be expected from the series of functions that will be given to the county court under the order. We are entitled to press the Attorney-General on the matter. Bills usually contain an assessment of manpower and financial consequences. What will be the net increase of staff from the alteration of the jurisdiction of the county court? What will be the net decrease in High Court staff that will presumably follow from the transfer of those functions? What will be the net financial consequences of the order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.54 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Norwood (Mr. Fraser) for his welcome of the order's thrust and his recognition of the importance that the Government attach to the use of specialist tribunals for children's cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about delays, which he rightly said cause the parties additional costs and frustration. He mentioned a case from Cornwall. We all sympathise with the point that he made. It is encouraging that trial centres are already established in 72 places, with four more to come, because it is so important to avoid adjournments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A development in the use of trial centres has been the recognition that there must be continued improvement in listing techniques. All of us who have practised in the courts know how important that is. Sometimes practitioners, knowing only one side of the case, feel that not enough attention has been paid to general convenience. More resources have been allocated to the task of researching how best to improve listing techniques. That will feed through to the clients in the way that the hon. Member for Norwood rightly regards as important.

The hon. Member for Norwood asked about the small claims court, the limit of which is to be raised to £1,000. The hon. Gentleman rightly suggested that it must be done by rules of court. It is planned that the £1,000 limit will take effect from 1 July.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman emphasised the impact of that on claims for personal injuries. There is nothing significant about claims for personal injuries that distinguishes them from other claims that fall within the jurisdiction of the small claims court. In general, the degree of complexity is not affected by the pecuniary value of a claim for personal injuries, except for very high claims. Someone whose claim will now be within the new limits for the jurisdiction of the small claims court will not be disadvantaged—and certainly not in a way that distinguishes that claim from claims of a different character in the small claims court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One cannot get very much today for £1,000 of general damages for pain and suffering and loss of amenity. Evaluation of the claim must take account of any claim for loss of earnings and other special damage. No hardship is likely to emerge from the procedure of the small claims court, which has worked very well. It has been a success story and we can be confident that it will continue to be one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Attorney-General recognises the qualitative difference between assessing damages for personal injuries and the cost of repairing a motor car that has been in an accident. In the latter, there is usually an invoice or a relatively easy method of assessing the damage involved —it is often a liquidated claim. Some aspects of a personal injury case will be relatively easy to substantiate—a calculation of loss of earnings, for example—but placing a value on a bruise or strained ankle or wrist is much more difficult, especially for an elderly person. In those cases, generally speaking, claimants will not be legally represented because they will not be able to get legal aid as no costs will be awarded. There is a difference of opinion about this. District judges who hear such cases have specialist knowledge and can interpret medical evidence, so that the claimant—perhaps vulnerable, often elderly people—will not be unduly disadvantaged by not having the assistance of a lawyer, who will be able to get costs as a result of the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a reasonable point. One of the praiseworthy features of the small claims court is that the procedure is informal. Registrars try hard to help the litigant because legal aid is not generally available, as the hon. Gentleman said. I am confident that registrars will be as helpful as possible in guiding the litigant on the value of a claim. The hon. Gentleman is right that the litigant will not have much idea of whether it is worth £1,000 or more or less.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should like to consider whether it is desirable to give guidance. I doubt that it will be as new district judges try hard to be helpful.

The hon. Member for Norwood said that the High Court does not have files and asked how the provisions on enforcement would work. Article 8 deals with enforcement. It provides that county court judgments for the payment of a sum of money of £5,000 or more may be enforced by execution against goods only in the High Court. When the sum is between £2,000 and £5,000, the judgment may be enforced in the High Court or a county court. A judgment below £2,000 must be enforced in a county court. Already, county court judgments for more than £2,000 can be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
enforced in the High Court and, as the present county court limit is £5,000, the article broadly preserves the present position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a judgment falls in the middle band and there is a choice, experience will determine whether the choice will be to go to the High Court. Courts and practitioners will wish to take careful account of how, in practice, the new provisions work. The Lord Chancellor will want to ensure that any changes that are shown to be necessary can be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Norwood rightly referred to the problem of delay in the taxation of costs, about which I have some good news. Courts have made good progress in the taxation of costs. The effect of the jurisdictional changes on the costs regime is a matter of much concern to everyone involved in civil litigation. The civil justice review recommended that there should be a "single costs regime" for the High Court and the county courts. The Government have accepted that recommendation and officials are discussing the issues with the Law Society and the General Council of the Bar to agree changes to the county court scales of costs that will complement the jurisdictional changes referred to in the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the High Court, costs are in the discretion of the taxing master under order 62 of the rules of the Supreme Court. In the county court, scale III already gives district judges discretion in the main "preparation for trial" item. It should be possible to implement a single costs regime with relatively minor amendments to the county court rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Lord Chancellor is considering targets for taxation. New and more detailed information from courts will help in the monitoring of delays. A recent survey of the 12 largest county courts showed that an average of 60 divorce, county court and High Court bills per court were awaiting taxation. The average delay in the oldest bill awaiting taxation was three months. That is not too bad; indeed, it is reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are aware from our constituency mail bags that long delays have occurred. However, on inquiry, it was found that sometimes the delay was caused by solicitors not submitting their bills for, on average, three months. That is an interesting point. However, in the interests of the ordinary litigant, it is important that delays are reduced.

The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) asked further about staff.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Attorney-General deal with the windfall increase in the value of sheriffs' fees on possession actions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Quite honestly, I cannot, as I have no information. I have noted that point and I am sure that the Lord Chancellor will want to ensure that the fees charged are reasonable. I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would be content with that reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 400 extra staff were taken on partly in anticipation of the changes and partly to deal with the existing work load. Other measures in the current year have released much staff time to prepare for those changes. Further staff increases in the forthcoming year will be needed to accommodate the changes, for which we have the figure of 100 extra staff in mind. I hope that that deals specifically with the points made by the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney.
