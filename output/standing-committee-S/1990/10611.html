	<div class='legislation'>HIGHER AND FURTHER EDUCATION</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Ian Lang)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do report to the House that the Committee has considered the matter of higher and further education in Scotland.</p></blockquote>
On the day that our White Paper on the future of higher and further education was published, I wrote to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) suggesting that we debate in the Scottish Grand Committee the proposals that affect Scotland. Today's debate is the result. I am most grateful for the opportunity to debate our plans for the future of higher and further education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was particularly pleased that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister made clear the importance that the Government attach to our proposals by making such a telling contribution to our press conference on 20 May. A few weeks ago I met the eight Scottish university principals and on Friday of last week my hon. Friend the Minister of State and I had a valuable meeting with the principals of the 17 centrally funded colleges. Those meetings have helped to set the scene for what will now be an important transitional phase when we work through the detailed arrangements for setting up the new Scottish Higher Education Funding Council. The Government are justly proud of what we have already achieved by our higher education policies. Participation by young Scots in the decade to 1990 has risen from under 17 per cent. to almost 25 per cent., or by nearly one half.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Worthington 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clydebank and Milngavie)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State admit that that achievement is relatively easy? If there is a 25 per cent. fall in the number of 17-year-olds, one has only to let into universities and colleges those rejected in 1980 to alter the figures from one in five to one in four.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be easy, but the hon. Gentlemam did not succeed in achieving that when his party was in power. Moreover, there was not a fall in the number of 17-year-olds of the size that he suggests in that decade, although more recently there has been a demographic change. A substantial expansion of higher education has taken place which has increased the number of those achieving degrees and diplomas. The figure was up by 12 per cent. between 1983 and 1989—a period when the number of young adults in Scotland fell by 3 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alistair Darling 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State made an announcement that was welcome by both sides when he said that in future Scottish universities would be subject to the control of a Scottish Universities Funding Council. Will the funding under the new regime be any more secure than it is under the present regime? Can he give a long-term view of how much money universities can expect to receive? I have in mind the university of Edinburgh. One of its difficulties is that it cannot enter into any long-term planning because the United Kingdom
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Universities Funding Council cannot give it any idea of what assumptions it can make over the next five to 10 years. We have seen the absurd spectacle of the university having to sell its art treasures—Scotland's treasures—to bale itself out because of the Government's inability to enter into any long-term planning. What confidence can we have that the situation will be any better when the Secretary of State's track record so far is abysmal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that the problems of Edinburgh university do not stem from the funding that it has received from the Universities Funding Council so much as from an inadequacy of internal financial controls. The university is tackling that matter according to its priorities and it is right that it should decide its priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's public expenditure programmes are carried forward on a three-year rolling basis. The situation has not changed since the last Government were in power and I do not envisage any substantial change arising from out present proposals. However, having a funding council based in Scotland that is relevant to Scotland's needs will mean a more direct application of priorities and principles to the use of funds. There will be more opportunity for Scottish universities to be involved in those decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Garscadden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State will remember that we have pressed for this change of structure for many years. I would be ungracious not to congratulate him on another U-turn. Scottish universities and colleges are suffering a sharp financial crisis. One has only to listen to what vice-principals have been saying about wages and the maintenance of buildings. Is the Secretary of State satisfied with the present level of funding? If not, will he guarantee that matters will improve in the immediate future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman can hardly accuse me of a U-turn when I have only just moved into the driving seat, but I am grateful to him for welcoming the decision that we have announced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a 10 per cent. real terms increase in funding over the past decade or so. I cannot stipulate the precise levels of future funding, but funding will come from the Scottish bloc. The allocation of funding will be at the discretion of the Secretary of State. For as many years as I am Secretary of State, I shall endeavour to bring to bear sensible judgments on priorities in Scottish universities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To return to the Secretary of State's answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling), I wish to ask the right hon. Gentleman a question about which I notified his office last week. What is the Secretary of State's policy on the sale of assets, such as the Audobon books by the university of Edinburgh? It would be helpful to the Committee to hear Government policy on the sale of assets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is essentially a matter for the university itself. With regard to the merits of particular arts treasure, there are mechanisms to identify national interest and bring to bear appropriate decisions and resources. That example is essentially an internal matter for Edinburgh university.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was talking about the expansion of higher education. The numbers qualifying for entry to higher education also rose substantially. In the decade to 1989, the proportion of Scottish school leavers with three or more highers rose from below one in five to almost one in four. We have also
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0254">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
been successful in widening access to higher education for those young people without standard qualifications. We have virtually quadrupled the proportion of such entrants, to over 5 per cent. As a result of all those successes, the full-time equivalent numbers in Scottish higher education have risen by over 17 per cent. since 1983, to over 100,000.

Building on those successes the overall participation rate by young Scots is likely to rise, not to the 33 per cent. level that we estimated until now but, to over 40 per cent. by the end of the century. As part of that achievement, we now seek in the next decade to push up participation in higher education by those without standard qualifications to over one in five.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State is talking about participation by young Scots in higher education. He would agree that funding for individuals is important. Will he confirm that the take-up of student loans in Scotland is low and that it is causing considerable hardship for Scottish students, as a result of which many are in great financial difficulties? Will the Secretary of State rethink the loans scheme and reintroduce full grants that take account of the full rate of inflation since the introduction of the loans scheme? When the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I discern a non sequitur in the hon. Gentleman's logic. If students are as hard-pressed as he says, one would expect the student loan takeup to be higher rather than lower, so he is not making a good point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member --> 	<div class='membercontribution'>	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not give way to the hon. Gentleman again. I look forward to him making his point later in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was talking about those without standard qualifications. To focus on that group is wholly realistic, given the demographic downturn in the numbers of young Scots through most of the next decade. That downturn presents us with the challenge of awakening the latent talents of those sold short in their learning experiences at school by encouraging them to achieve their true potential. That challenge will be met by the policies in our White Papers, which are designed to broaden access and maximise the currency of training skill levels in the national work force. Also, the Scottish wider access programme, which is designed for mature students, will this year see some 1,000 additional students entering higher education; and the advanced courses development programme of SCOTVEC will encourage increased take-up among those pursuing higher national certificate and diploma courses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gordon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State talks about increased access. Will he comment on the development of the Open university in Scotland, especially in rural areas, where many people feel shut out through a lack of support facilities? Will the Scottish Office accept some responsibility for funding Open university courses in such areas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the question of wider access, expansion has been dramatic—64 per cent. over the past decade. The Open university will continue to operate on a United Kingdom basis. However, we shall ensure that a full Scottish input is included in the provision of Open
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
university courses. I agree with the hon. Gentleman about the Open university's importance in rural areas—not to mention Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise that the further expansion of higher education will not signal a dilution of quality and standards. Quality considerations will be at the centre of the development of our proposals for further and higher education and I am confident that our institutions will continue to maintain and enhance their standards under the new regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have to say to the Committee that we have been greatly encouraged by the welcome given to our proposals, which are designed to give a unity of purpose and policy direction to Scottish post-school education. As an example, I shall quote from a letter, which I received from Principal Forty of Stirling university on behalf of the Committee of Scottish University Principals. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are unanimous in our support for the provisions of the White Paper. We also welcome the Government's intention to set up a Scottish Higher Education Funding Council and declare our determination that it should succeed. It is in everyone's interest that it should do so."</p></blockquote>
The same unanimous welcome was given to the provisions at a meeting with college principals and is reflected in the responses of political parties in the House. When added to our proposals for further education, which I announced in my statement of 21 March, and the positive early signs of Scottish Enterprise's success in effecting training strategies with a vocational emphasis, our total package is both coherent and forward looking. Our plans seek to build on the established successes of Scottish post-school education, especially the high and still expanding levels of participation, the development of multi-level access to encourage mature students into education and the high quality of course content which ensures that Scottish students are so highly regarded at home and abroad.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monklands, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to press on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our aim in the two White Papers is to break down two outdated but still pervasive barriers. The first applies to both documents. It is the artificial distinction between a vocational and an academic education. Neither is superior to the other. Both are essential to the social and economic well-being of the nation. In both cases, students and teaching staff alike have, as their objective, the attainment of a qualification that is founded on standards of excellence and commands the respect of prospective employers. That objective, the pursuit of quality, must be retained while we expand the numbers that benefit from higher and further education. When we examine the energy and commitment that our major competitors invest in the education of their future work force, we can see all too clearly the need for us to respond. We aim to maintain our existing strengths, but we also seek to foster new talents and skills, especially in the development of inter-disciplinary specialisms where new employment opportunities are opening up rapidly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In addition to the traditional strengths to which the Secretary of State refers, is there a place for the traditional element of research in universities? I visited St. Andrews university, of which two Scottish Office Ministers are graduates. There was much apprehension in the astronomy department about the Government's failure to ensure proper funding for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0255">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
scientific research. How will the proposals outlined this morning, give the astronomy department of St. Andrews university confidence about the Government's commitment to scientific research?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. and learned Gentleman examines the White Paper, he will find such a commitment. The funding council decides about the allocation of resources for basic and strategic research. Universities usually receive most of the resources for such research. Applied research, which is usually funded by industry, is the prerogative of central institutions. I do not expect that balance to change dramatically, because the missions of the central institutions will not change greatly in the years ahead. However, the central institutions will be able to compete for funds. That competition will gradually change the balance and will lead to research of higher quality being carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second of the unnecessary and unnatural distinctions that we seek to remove is that forming the so-called binary line in higher education. Our benchmark for comparison is the attainment level of the student, which is a product of native intellect allied to the skills and commitment of the academic staff of the institutions concerned. I should make it absolutely clear today that I have the highest regard for the standards now being achieved in Scotland's higher education institutions, and the Government are committed to doing everything possible to enhance those standards still further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we break down the barriers, we must seek to build a national consensus in Scotland on the direction and structure of our further and higher education. That consensus has had some early encouragement in first responses to the White Paper. I look to the Opposition to join us—[	<i>Laughter.</i>] There are truly historic opportunities and we all must engage in a thoroughgoing, positive debate about the ways in which we might improve our education system still further. In particular, we should consider the opportunities that our proposals present for increasing the effectiveness of our investment in higher and further education to the benefit of students and their potential employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any process of such major reform it is of course essential that we consult with those affected. There are over 15,000 full-time lecturing and academic staff in further education and centrally funded colleges and universities, and over 4,000 part-time staff. Those institutions and staff, in subject range, geographic location and tradition, have a very diverse set of circumstances. In approaching consultation on our proposals, I should emphasise our concern to indentify and remove any regulatory or bureaucratic obstacles to achieving the integration that we see as affording a positive way forward. We are committed to individuals being able to realise their full potential in the new framework.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will also consult on the quality assessment and quality assurance aspects of our higher education proposals. On those, I should make it absolutely clear that our primary intention is to advance excellence. Students can readily discriminate between courses on offer. They will exert most of the market forces necessary to weed out poor courses. The other major issue on which we will consult will
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
be funding for research in higher education, which is especially important to Scotland, where there is now a considerable research base on which to build.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The esssence of our higher education proposals and their broad sweep are well understood, but I can encapsulate them for the Committee as follows. First, a new Scottish Higher Education Funding Council will be created, with responsibility for funding both teaching and general research in all major Scottish higher education institutions. Secondly, degree awarding powers will be extended to Napier polytechnic and Glasgow polytechnic and, subject to criteria to be agreed, to some other major institutions. Thirdly, polytechnics—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me finish my encapsulation first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Polytechnics and, subject again to the development of satisfactory criteria, certain other major higher education institutions will be allowed to include the word "university" in their title if they wish. Fourthly, following the disbanding of the Council for National Academic Awards, a United Kingdom-wide academic audit unit will be established to ensure satisfactory quality control in teaching throughout higher education. Finally, a quality assessment unit will be set up within the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council to monitor relative quality standards across Scottish institutions and to collaborate with the parallel units in other funding councils to maintain common standards throughout the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an extremely important matter for the institutions involved. It seems to be clear that Napier and Glasgow polytechnics will become universities. However, there is no similar clarity about Robert Gordon's or Dundee and Paisley polytechnics. Those institutions are worried that the doubt about their status will count against them when they seek to attract students in the next few years. There should be no equivalent of planning blight in this matter. What does the Secretary of State intend to do to clarify those institutions' status?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have already had one meeting with the principals of the central institutions, at which they set out their criteria for eligibility for university status. We undertook to consider those criteria, and I made it clear that we did not rule out the possibility that university status would be extended to institutions other than Napier and Glasgow polytechnics. However, only those two institutions will be eligible to adopt the title "university" after the legislation is passed. The ability of other institutions to award degrees and to assume university status will be the subject of further consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that the Secretary of State wants to make progress, but will he tidy up one matter? Presumably, the right to the term "university" is in the gift of the Government. However, on degree-giving courses, the Council for National Academic Awards is being abolished. What will replace it and who will monitor standards?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are consulting on the criteria that would lead to eligibility for degree-awarding status. Accredited status, which the two polytechnics and the three colleges mentioned already have, would be a key component. The colleges suggested others, for example, academic maturity, track record of high quality, cost-effectiveness, innovative
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0256">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
ability, responsiveness to academic needs and so on. Those criteria will be taken into account in the consultation process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In summary, the reforms mark the start of a new era for higher education in Scotland. I have every confidence that they will further increase access and improve standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper "Access and Opportunity" presents our plans for education and training for those over 16. Education and training are vital for our future economic prosperity. At present fewer and fewer jobs are unskilled and that trend will continue. We want to create a culture in which all Scots have the opportunity and incentive to unlock their potential, by making more accessible the training and education that they and our economy need. We aim to encourage expansion by the introduction of the new general Scottish vocational qualifications. It will be a broadly based qualification which will open doors to a range of occupations or to higher education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An important theme of our policies is the need to foster close links between employers and the education system. The formation of Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise, and the network of local enterprise companies are important in forging a new partnership between education and industry. I mentioned choice in relation to our reform of vocational qualifications. Choice also lies at the core of our plans for stimulating demand among young people for vocational education and training. That is why we propose to expand the training credits scheme to permit local enterprise companies to develop new solutions to encourage young people back into education and training. Local enterprise companies will be invited to submit bids for local schemes to operate training credits from April 1993. The aim will be to extend the coverage of the scheme to a further 10 per cent. of the 16 and 17-year-olds leaving full-time education. Thereafter, we aim to extend credits progressing year by year to ensure that by 1996 every young person in Scotland who leaves full-time education can have a training credit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Hughes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As Grampian is the scene of the trial scheme, I shall give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Secretary of State said that Grampian is the scene of the trial scheme as I do not want to cast doubts on the bona fides of Grampian Enterprise. When I met representatives of Grampian Enterprise a couple of weeks ago, they were honest and straightforward but they could not answer questions about the monitoring of the scheme, how employers would be brought into training, or how contact between youngsters and employers would be made. They had no idea how many companies would take part and they said, honestly, "We cannot tell you that because this is a pilot scheme and we do not know how it will work." That being so, how can the Secretary of State say with such certainty that the scheme will be extended? It might fail; he should perpare himself for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman welcomes this creative, forward looking scheme or not. If I were the Member of Parliament for a Grampian constituency, I should be delighted that Grampian was one of the 10 or so areas in the United Kingdom, and the only one in Scotland, to have secured the funding to develop a
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
pilot scheme. I am encouraged by the positive commitment of the Grampian local enterprise company to develop the scheme. Grampian will take advantage of it sooner than the rest of Scotland. My ambition is that the scheme should spread to the rest of Scotland as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local enterprise companies will also be expected to take a greater interest in and collaborate with the careers service. Good careers work is crucial. Young people need insights into jobs and to experience the world of work. They need to be made aware of the wide range of further education and training opportunities that exist. Choice can be effective only if information is available to make an informed decision. Our policies will aim, therefore, to ensure that the careers service raises its standards, works more closely with schools, colleges and employers and encourages more young people to continue in education and training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further measure to develop the partnership between education and employers will be the expansion of the Compact initiative. That is a valuable way of building links between schools and employers and encouraging young people to set challenging goals. Local enterprise companies will play a key part in that process in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to succeed in our goals of increasing participation, higher levels of qualifications and widening access, the colleges of further education must play a major role. They are increasingly popular, particularly with adults, and over 200,000 Scots each year study in them. Most communities are within easy reach of college, with 46 colleges spread throughout Scotland. The main part of their work is the provision of vocational education and training, but I recognise that they have a wider role in relation to their local communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our policies aim to enhance the prominence of the colleges and give them a new freedom to release their energies. The colleges are ready for that new status. They have grown up from the days when they were essentially low-status technical colleges, and are now mature institutions providing a wide range of courses up to and including higher national diplomas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and Kinross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. Friend be mindful that Opposition Members always oppose any form of classification? If we call a college of excellence, such as Napier which has magnificent single disciplines, a university, it will immediately want a vice-chancellor, a library, a department of mediaeval French and much other paraphernalia irrelevant to what such colleges teach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon. and learned Friend will consider bequeathing his library to a college. He makes an interesting point and I hope that he will develop it during the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The colleges are now mature institutions and are increasingly developing links with higher education institutions and providing a bridge for their students to progress. Their links with local employers are also strong. That helps to ensure the relevance of the colleges' work and that their students are sought after.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The growing maturity of the colleges was recognised when we made provision in 1989 for education authorities to give strengthened college councils new powers relating to management, supervision and financial control. Those powers are substantial and over the next two years college councils will gain valuable experience in exercising them. Mature institutions, however, should have wider freedoms
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0257">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
to develop their role further. That is why we plan to introduce legislation to establish the colleges as freestanding corporate bodies with power to employ staff and own land and buildings, funded by grant from central Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If colleges are to be successful they must aim to provide a high quality, relevant education. Only by doing so can they generate a greater demand for their courses and qualifications. The Fast Forward with Further Education initiative, which I launched last year, has helped to raise awareness of further education and in March this year the colleges contributed to a successful further education week, the first of its sort. That initiative will continue. I also attach great importance to systems that will ensure the quality of education and training provided by the colleges. In funding the colleges in future we shall, therefore, seek to achieve a balance between rewarding those colleges that perform better than others and achieving the financial stability necessary during a period of change. We shall assist colleges in the drive for higher standards, and the Scottish further education unit, which we recently created, will be well placed to support colleges in preparing staff for the challenges that lie ahead. I should like to pay tribute to the staff of the colleges and what they have achieved in recent years in implementing the reforms of vocational qualifications. I should also like to assure them of their future after 1 April 1993 and the support that we shall give them in preparing for it. The future of further education is bright and exciting. There is a reservoir of unskilled people who need to be prepared to play their part in the economy of the future. Our policies will create the framework for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have the vision to see our proposals for what they are—a watershed in the long and distinguished history of Scottish higher education. They have been described as revolutionary by some—and that may well be so—but given the almost universal acclaim with which they have been received in Scotland, they must be seen as foreshadowing a benign revolution in higher education. That positive judgment from such a demanding jury as the Scottish academic and industrial community convinces me that we are on the right track. I trust that the Opposition will agree and give our proposals the full support that they richly deserve. I commend the White Papers to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Worthington 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clydebank and Milngavie)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We welcome the chance to discuss the Government's proposals. In particular, we welcome the transfer of responsibilities for Scottish universities to Scotland. We congratulate the Government on moving part of the way towards Labour Party policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour Party would put the Scottish education system under the auspices of a Scottish Parliament to ensure adequate debate on, scrutiny of and respect for Scottish education, such as a Scottish Parliament would provide. It is striking that that policy is supported by virtually the entire Scottish education system. That was not the case in 1979, but 12 years of Tory Government have caused the Scottish higher education system to support Labour policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
Sadly, the proposals are not a principled decision by the Government, but have been prompted by the cock-ups that have been made over the years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is true that the Government have embraced Labour Party policy, why was there not mention of such proposals in the Labour Party manifesto of 1987?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been Labour Party policy for as long as I can remember that responsibility for Scottish higher education should be transferred to a Scottish Parliament. The Labour Party has always intended that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Universities Funding Council planning system collapsed although long-term planning was intended. W. Kerr Fraser, Principal of the university of Glasgow and previously a senior civil servant, described the activities of the UFC:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I wrote last year that I thought that, as a piece of administration, it was disgraceful. All I would add now is that it proved prodigiously wasteful of precious time and effort in the British universities."</p></blockquote>
Following the collapse of the UFC's proposals, there was a proposal to unify the UFC and the funding system for polytechnics. That would clearly have created problems in Scotland because of the Scottish colleges. It was unthinkable that the Scottish colleges should be controlled from Bristol. The Government realised that there would have to be a Scottish Higher Education Funding Council. That is why there will be one, not because of any principled decision by the Secretary of State. The Labour Party welcome the transfer and we shall redouble our efforts to make sure that in future control is in Labour hands under a Scottish Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The higher education White Paper is grossly complacent. The only country that we compare well with, in the numbers of students continuing in education, is England. The Confederation of British Industry said recently:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The United Kingdom is at or near the bottom of most international league tables of educational attainments."</p></blockquote>
It is good that one in four children reach higher education standard, but that figure lags behind all our industrial competitors. Over 70 per cent. reach higher education standard in Canada, Japan and the USA. Now, belatedly, the Scottish Office is expanding education, but it is doing so on the cheap by holding back salaries, delaying repairs to buildings and delaying the purchase of equipment. Britain was almost alone duing the 1980s in cutting the share of national wealth devoted to education. No wonder other economies grew, while that investment was occurring. The Government would have cut investment in education further if local councils had allowed them to get away with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our higher education system is not expensive compared with others. In 1986, the most recent year for which Department of Education and Science figures are available, Britain spent £15,600 on producing a graduate. Holland spent £30,000, the United States £24,000, Canada £22,000, Denmark £29,000, Japan £28,000, Italy £20,000 and Germany £16,000. However, the Government have sought to reduce constantly the unit cost of producing a graduate. Despite our system's relative cheapness, the Government want to cut costs even further. That is a recipe for disaster. They are putting the universities and polytechnics together to cut costs, not to improve standards, and they are risking the reputation of Scottish education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0258">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
There is about this document a smell of false economies, of penny pinching and of seeking to reduce universities to the level of polytechnics in terms of funding. University salaries have fallen compared with non-manual earnings. Over the past 12 years, they have fallen, relatively speaking, behind those of school teachers. The age of staff has risen since 1980. In 1980, 24 per cent. of staff were under 35—now the figure is 15 per cent. There is a huge underclass in the universities of short-term, low-paid temporary workers. Income levels are much higher elsewhere. It is incredible, but fewer lecturers were funded by the UFC in 1990 than in 1979. The shortfall is made up by industry, and although its contribution is welcome, funding from industry should be additional, not a substitute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The student: lecturer ratio in universities has worsened by 20 per cent. Class sizes have risen. Lecturers have been offered a 5 per cent. increase this year, so one sees the abnormal spectacle of employers begging the Government for more money to pay their lecturers more. I shall quote from a letter that a constituent of mine, a senior lecturer in chemistry at Glasgow university, wrote to the Secretary of State for Education and Science. He says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"My own case is not untypical. I regard myself as reasonably successful: in the past six years I have carried out all the government's edicts—I have raised nearly £500,000 in grants, half of it from industry; my research output continues to rise; I teach more students, and I have a heavier teaching load. (up by at least 50 per cent.). My rewards are meagre—a promotion in which I lost tenure, and a continuing decline in my real salary. This year it seems possible that I shall receive 5 per cent., while all comparable professions at least keep up with inflation. Can you"—</p></blockquote>
"You" is the Secretary of State for Education—
	<br><blockquote><p>"please explain to me why as one who trains the Chemists who subsequently staff our most successful industry, and who carries out research of an internationally recognised high standard, I am worth so little in the eyes of this government?"</p></blockquote>
The conditions of buildings give cause for concern. At British universities—it is difficult to separate out the Scottish figures—there are 55,000 more students than in 1979. That is welcome, but we spend less on buildings in 1991 than we did in 1979. The result is the equivalent of seven medium-sized universities housed at less cost than in 1979. In 1988, University Grants Committee said that £250,000 more was needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour party policy has also been to abolish the binary divide—not the binary line, which is a creation of the Government's White Paper. The binary divide means that there is a gap. That gap must be bridged, which is done by evening up or cutting down. We fear that the Government will level the universities down to the polytechnic standard. It would be possible for universities to become polytechnics. I have never heard of a university that wanted to become a polytechnic, but of course polytechnics are queuing to become universities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his reply to me, the Secretary of State failed to deal with one issue of the utmost seriousness to those institutions. It is clear that Napier and Glasgow colleges can become universities. We have no quarrel with that. But, because of the differences between the Scottish and English systems, there are three institutions about which there is a lack of clarity: Dundee, Robert Gordon's and Paisley. It will not do for those institutions to have to wait for legislation that might be introduced by a future Government in several years' time to find out whether they are to become universities or not. It will be devastating to its future if, for example, Dundee cannot say to students whom it is trying to attract whether it will be a university or
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
not. I know that the Secretary of State cannot do it on his own, but, with the co-operation of his colleagues in England and Wales, he must find a way to resolve that lack of clarity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The level of funding was another matter about which the Secretary of State was not clear. There is a dual funding system whereby the universities automatically receive money for basic research. That money does not go to the polytechnics or colleges. There is no reference in the White Paper to polytechnics receiving basic research money as of right. Everyone is to compete for the same money. The Secretary of State referred to the 1991 word, which apparently is "missions". Apparently the research missions of the colleges and universities are not to change much. That is a strange way of bridging a divide. In essence, that means that the polytechnics will remain much as they are. That is to change words, not the actual institution. The issue is whether polytechnics will be funded on a similar basis to universities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing in the White Paper either about an issue of great concern to Scotland which was mentioned by the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce). That is the future of higher education in the more remote parts of Scotland. That issue must be tackled soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like the Secretary of State or Minister of State, if not in this forum then elsewhere, to refer to the Open university. It is a splendid success in Scotland. There are more Open university entrants in Scotland than anywhere else in the United Kingdom. The Open university is to be funded by the English Higher Education Funding Council. We must ensure that Scottish interests are taken into account. I have often felt, as I know the Open university people in Scotland feel, that the Open university is in Scotland but not of Scotland. There is a great case, given the geography of Scotland, for giving the Open university a stronger presence there and for using its skills more. I fear that, with the centralising of funding in the English Higher Education Funding Council, that will not occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally on higher education policy, the Secretary of State did not mention the issue that above all worries people in Scotland. The nature of Scottish education system and the commitment of the Scottish people and local authorities to education mean that Scotland has more university graduates per capita than the rest of the United Kingdom. There are more universities, more university places and more higher education places per capita than in the rest of the United Kingdom. What will the Secretary of State do to ensure that that is maintained and enhanced? I hope that the Minister of State will reply to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of quality is central. There is a heavy burden upon the Government. No higher education institution, no university or college will ever admit that its standards have fallen. To do so would be fatal. They will always complain about their entrants and say that schools are not doing their job but that at the end of their three or four years their graduates are first rate. The institutions will not complain, but they are very worried about the diminishing investment in universities and colleges. There is a heavy responsibility on the Government to ensure that quality is there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem with the White Paper is that it is so skimpy. It is an utterly inadequate way of dealing with £200 million of public money. One expects a Government paper to show evidence of research into weaknesses and strengths in the system and some analysis of what ought to happen. All that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0259">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
we have here is a simple series of statements. We are, for example, to have more Compacts. I have a Compact in my area and I have no complaint about the way it works as it seems to work well. But we need some analysis of how those Compacts have worked and how they need to be strengthened. We have simply a statement that they will be extended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This initiative has quite clearly come into being as a result of the Government's problems with the poll tax. What logic is there in having a statement to the House of Commons on poll tax problems and further education issues? It was brought forward then because there had to be a start to the transfer of certain responsibilities from local to central Government. The trouble is that the Minister of State has had to tell us that this is simply the first step in the removal of all education from local authorities to central Government. It is the sheer impulsiveness of the FE document with its centralisation of control that is so striking. During the last couple of years a piece of legislation was enacted which changed the role of the FE colleges, but it started operating only in January. The full financial controls come in only next year, but suddenly we have an impetuous centralisation of control by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many areas that I should like to examine in much more detail, but our structure here prevents that. However, I should like to comment on the careers service, which the Government hardly mention. The document simply states that it is not satisfactory under its present management by the local authorities and that it is to be transferred to some unknown body which, reading between the lines, probably has something to do with the local enterprise companies. We all agree that information, advice and counselling for young people are crucial, and some improvements may be needed in the careers service and in the information and advice system for adults which is not even mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government suddenly want to take control of the careers service away from the local authorities, yet they give no reason. They say they are concerned about the future. But there are other areas of information, advice and counselling about which they should be concerned. What about the employment training scheme? What about the information and advice available there to which the Government do not respond and where there is privatisation? I quote from a document from the Action Trust about employment training and the quality of advice given by training agents. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The average time spent by Training Agents assessing, counselling and preparing the action plan for our trainees was 13 minutes, but more than half of those who specified a time had only five minutes or less with their Training Agent."</p></blockquote>
That is an example of privatised, commercially confidential careers work about which the Government show no concern. They propose to transfer the careers service into the same privatised framework which we will not be able to scrutinise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should debate training credits in greater detail but we cannot. The pilot scheme has been pronounced a success simply because it has started. The document must have been prepared at about the same time that Grampian started its training credit scheme, but it has been pronounced a success—wonderful news. Everyone is to have a training credit. We have gone along with a
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
sympathetic hearing to training credits and believed that they should be tried, but the pilot scheme should be genuine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a muddle at the centre of the document which I hope the Minister of State will deal with. Training credits are to be provided only when the private employer would not have provided training. As, in future, everyone is to have a training credit, how will it be possible to discern when the private employer was not to provide that training? A massive expansion in training funds will be necessary if all the training available before from private employers is to be provided and if everyone is to have a training credit. I cannot believe that this Government will make available that massive amount of money. Perhaps the Minister of State will deal with that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want the Minister of State to deal with a point about social and recreational education either now or at a later stage. Apparently, FE colleges are to concentrate on vocational education, although I am pleased to note some exceptions: English as a second language and basic adult education, for example. The meaning of the term "social and recreational education" is unclear. What will be provided by local authorities? It seems strange that local authorities will retain a role in further education. They will keep the problems and will still have to administer the bursary system. It is too complicated to work out the debts of colleges, so local authorities will continue to pay them, but it is unclear what form of education they are to provide in future. What is "social and recreational education"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document hints that unless education is vocational, the provision of education must be fee-borne. Are the Government withdrawing from all forms of education that are not vocational, apart from the exceptions that I mentioned, and will all social and recreational education have to be borne by fees? Local authorities do a great deal for pensioners' groups and do not expect those courses to wash their own face financially, but in future will the Workers Educational Association, community education and many other bodies interested in education have to break even or make a profit?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The common thread to both White Papers is that they do not mention money. If the Opposition had made such proposals without mentioning money, we would have been attacked. There is no commitment to the expansion of resources. All change is to be achieved by competition and by efficiency savings. We must ensure that we get rid of this Government and perceive education in terms of investment rather than cost. When we do so, we shall have an education system that attains the goals of the Secretary of State. At present, the goals are right, but they will not be attained because of this Govenment's attitude.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Scottish education has a great deal going for it. In a host of areas, Scotland is on the European and world scale in terms of activity and quality of service. There are graduate professions, high standards of training, a general teaching council and a population that savours and appreciates the value of good education and training. We have a solid Scottish base for further progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0260">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
My criticism is that the system could easily be even better, with a higher level of activity and service. Scotland's education must be organised on a national and fully co-ordinated basis, with each distinct stage clear and interwoven as a ladder of progress for every citizen to fulfil his or her individual potential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The setting up of the separate funding council for Scottish higher education is a step in the right direction, even if it has been forced by developments in England rather than by concern for the quality of Scottish education. The measure has been advocated for years by the Scottish National party and others interested in Scottish education because of bitter experience of the serious defects in funding through a United Kingdom body. However, a separate funding council is not, by itself, enough unless its members have long experience and deep knowledge of the Scottish system and the determination to preserve and extend its unique and valuable characteristics. The Government will do a great disservice to education if they pack the new body with placemen and placewomen. Its function is too important for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The council must be genuinely autonomous and under no obligation to follow English policies or examples. It should develop a coherent policy related to the needs of the rest of the Scottish education system and of the Scottish people. It should be committed to the principles of the Scottish democratic intellect. We inherited those traditions and we must develop and expand them as we go into the 21st century. If the council is to work properly, it should give a special attention to the encouragement of studies important to Scotland that in the past received inadequate treatment. For example, it is a national scandal that no Scottish university has an established chair of Scottish literature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What finance does the Government have in mind for the council? Its funding must be on a scale that meets Scotland's special needs, reflects the priority that our country traditionally attaches to education and repairs the unacceptable damage inflicted on Scottish universities by the gross underfunding of the past decade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The special needs of Scotland derive, among other factors, from the high proportion of expensive departments such as medicine in which we rightly take pride. In Scotland, there is a much higher ratio of students to the population as a whole than in England. Allocation of funds based on a simple calculation of the population would be wholly inadequate and should not be permitted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman absolutely sure that that favourable percentage will continue under the new arrangement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly the assurance that I seek. I do so with trepidation because the Government's previous record does not give me confidence in their approach to health or to education. The Minister must state clearly that the funding will guarantee the system to which the hon. Gentleman referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is true of the system is also true of the students. The Government's policies on student loans and on cuts in social security and other benefits act as a positive and major deterrent to potential students. The Government are misguided and mean spirited in their financial attitude to the students of Scotland. I regret that the present generation is denied the advantages that I received, which allowed me to benefit from tertiary education. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
Government deter those who should participate in the tertiary system. Society is the poorer for such a short-sighted, mean-spirited attitude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When, oh when, will a university of the highlands be established? Such a university would breathe new life and opportunities into the economy and intellectual existence of north Scotland. However, the Government and the Opposition are committed to pouring £10 billion into new Trident submarine and missile systems. They will not deliver on education or humanity. We should examine the potential for the tertiary system to become a national system in Scotland and to service Scottish needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an urgent need to foster and develop science subjects and languages in universities and other places of further education. However, the greatest need is to ensure employment opportunities for our graduates and students who leave further education. The Scottish economy deserves to be prosperous, but, until the Government creates prosperity, they will fail to guarantee employment opportunities. The boast that Scotland has the most educated dole queue in the world is futile. Until the Government sort out the Scottish economy, we shall always fail our graduates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[Mr. Norman Hogg 	<i>in the Chair</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The further education service has an excellent record. However, it also provides many examples of missed opportunities. It is possible to combine languages with other subjects, but it is impossible to major in languages with the other subjects. The Secretary of State should ask SCOTVEC what is is playing at. Given the development of the European Community, language teaching should be a priority throughout the Scottish education system and should receive special emphasis in the tertiary sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The greatest service to Scottish education would be to ensure co-ordination, continuity and the necessary cash within a truly national framework. I must take the Government to task over their philistine attitude to research, which is the seed corn of future development. The veneer of market research has been placed on study in agricultural colleges. However, that veneer merely disguises cuts in actual research. The Government should sort out their priorities and increase the amount of money available for research.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although decision making in further education colleges will be devolved to local areas, it is important to ensure that such devolution does not become fragmentation. A national overview should be established to maintain coherence of approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The inspectorate does a good job, but what if it is wrong about some matters? How can someone gain redress for an inaccurate inspector's report? Dr. Bainbridge of Monifieth, through sheer tenacity, successfully obtained a retraction of damaging accusations made in an inspector's report. However, he is still unable to obtain answers to fundamental questions about public statements that were made about his former department. Will the Minister consider setting up a mechanism that allows an educational professional to appeal against public assumptions made by the inspectorate?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the new funding system is set up, how will the career service in Scotland be financed? If college assets are frozen until 1993, how can the Minister guarantee that the system will not stagnate? How can he ensure the dynamic within the system, which is essential in order to plan ahead?
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0261">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
What will happen to Scottish certificate of education provision, to adult and community education and to evening classes? I know from personal experience that further education can greatly benefit people who have missed out at school or adults who have been unemployed and return to education. What guarantees are there of the continuity of those further educational services?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who will be responsible for FE bursaries? Will it be local enterprise companies, the Scottish Office Education Department or local authorities? That is fundamental. What about student associations? They have been a much neglected part of further education but are important to the life and activity of further education colleges. What funding and assistance wil be given to those associations for necessary development, or will they get nothing?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Important links have been built between schools and further education colleges—I was involved in that process as a lecturer and teacher. What mechanisms are planned to ensure that the two sectors continue to work together now that they are no longer commonly funded? If there is a trend towards employer-dominated college councils, what will happen to socially desirable courses? If colleges are to be market and profit-oriented, what will happen to courses for the physically and mentally handicapped? Those courses are important for equipping such people with the skills to play a part in the wider community as well as producing qualifications. If the ethos of further education colleges is to be market-driven and geared towards generating income from business, will socially essential courses be financed? What will happen to the necessary adaptations in buildings? From where will the cash for those things come?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scotland has traditionally valued education and made it available to all who could benefit from it, irrespective of their backgrounds. That should and must remain the goal of our education system as it moves towards the 21st century. The sooner we get a governmental system that can fulfil that goal, the better. I await the Minister's response to find out whether the system that he proposes has the answer to those questions. So far I doubt it, but only the Minister can say whether he will provide the resources to allow tertiary education to contribute what it can, and must, to Scotland as we approach the 21st century.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the funding of universities will be the responsibility of the Scottish Office, it is important that the universities remain within the community of the universities of the United Kingdom. Universities are marked out by the interchange of students, staff and ideas within one country and across national boundaries. We must keep that interchange among Scottish universities and other universities in England and Wales and overseas. That international outlook has always marked Scottish universities. Anyone with a knowledge of their history will know of the close and regular links in previous centuries
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
between Scottish universities and similar establishments in countries such as Germany and Holland. I hope that such links are maintained and that we remain outward-looking and avoid the risk of becoming inward-looking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I unashamedly want the best of both worlds.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the funding be adequate? We have four ancient universities in Scotland with a wide range of disciplines. That means that, compared with universities south of the border, our universities tend to be more costly. That is further aggravated by the fact that we have four medical schools, which are among the most expensive of university faculties. So, in relation to the population of the area covered by the Scottish Office, the available financial resources are inadequate. It is important that the high proportion of ancient universities and medical schools in relation to the population served are fully taken into account in the negotiations between the Scottish Office and the Treasury. When I say that our universities are more costly, I do not mean that they are less efficient or effective in using their resources. We require a higher proportion of the available resources. That recognises a historical fact which I hope will be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A specific problem that concerns the north-east of Scotland is the tragic dispute between Aberdeen university and the Scottish Agricultural college. It is thoroughly retrograde to have a legal dispute that could lead to eventual costly litigation in the courts. That is dangerous and could lead to a split between the middle tier of higher education provided by agricultural colleges and the top tier of education and research provided by the university. One of our greatest assets in our agricultural education and research structure has been the integration between the middle and top tiers. It has worked successfully for many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation arose because of the implementation of the Williams report, which the Government commissioned to rationalise the system of Scottish agricultural colleges. I gave the Government a full paper criticising that report in which I said that I foresaw the danger of a split between the top and middle tiers of agricultural education and research. I take no pleasure in foreseeing that split, but I did not think that it would happen in the way that it has. However, it has happened and we must all bend our minds and wills to resolving the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising a point that I was about to tackle. However, the Committee should be aware of the serious consequences of the split. In the longer run, it could affect the viability of the university's department of agriculture. The department is not large and relies heavily for its teaching on the staff of the college of agriculture. It is therefore not in the university's interest to allow the dispute to continue. In addition, it would be unforgivable if a split caused the college of agriculture to build or acquire new premises when it already has premises in Aberdeen. That would cause duplication and would make no sense in terms of the use of national resources. It is for that reason that the split must not be allowed to continue any longer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the hon. Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hughes), I, too, should like to know whether the line taken by the university has been discussed and supported by the university court. That should be made clear as soon as possible. All parties must realise…</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I would rather not give way. Many other hon. Members wish to speak in the debate. All parties—the university most of all—must realise that this is a new situation. I did not like the Williams report, nor did I like all the Government's proposals that stemmed from it, but it is a fact that we have to accept. We have moved on and cannot turn the clock back. Moreover, the east of Scotland former college and the university of Edinburgh, and the west of Scotland former college and the universities of Glasgow and Strathclyde, appear to have been able to make the new arrangements work. That is a lesson to which Aberdeen university in particular must pay attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must not lose the integration between universities and colleges, and between degree and diploma courses. We must retain that concept and ensure that that integration remains a reality, because it has been one of the Scottish system's great assets, envied both south of the border and in many countries overseas. Surely some compromise must be possible. For example, I understand that there has been anxiety that the colleges may try to run degree courses in competition with universities. However, the Scottish Agricultural college has said that it has no such aspiration. It is happy to continue to run diploma courses and to allow Aberdeen university to maintain responsibility for degree courses. That is typical of the give and take that is needed to reach agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The one glimmer of light in the present difficulty is that, despite the dispute at the top, matters appear to be going on as usual down at the working level of staff and students. I therefore hope that those at the top can resolve their differences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government must take some responsibility if the parties involved in the dispute ultimately fail to resolve their differences. The Government created the problem in commissioning and implementing the Williams report. It is crazy that two Government-funded bodies—the university and the Scottish Agricultural college—should be involved in a dispute that could lead to litigation in the courts. It is even crazier, in the context of this Scottish Grand
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
Committee, that in the future both the university and the Scottish Agricultural college will be funded by the Scottish Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the dispute is not resolved, many people will lose their patience with those involved in it. Any individual who provokes or continues it rightly deserves criticism. It is unfair on staff and on the customers of the college and the university, whether they be farmers, students or research funding organisations. There is a huge responsibility on all involved to thrash out this dispute for the benefit of everyone. I address my remarks particularly to those parties to the dispute. However, if it is not resolved, I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will not hesitate to step in and knock heads together to ensure that the matter is properly resolved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William McKelvey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kilmarnock and Loudoun)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must raise an issue that was brought to my attention as recently as Saturday, at my surgery. I refer to the Teacher Education Admissions Clearing House. TEACH, as it is euphemistically called, was established in 1989 by the Joint Committee of Colleges of Education in Scotland. The colleges attempted to emulate the Universities Central Council on Admissions system which has operated successfully in England, Wales and Northern Ireland for many years. Unfortunately, students wishing to undertake teacher training in Scotland have received the worst possible deal because of the way that the TEACH system operates. That will perhaps be clearer when I explain and compare the differences between the two systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the English system, the student lists his or her choice of colleges in order of preference. The applications are then sent out to all colleges simultaneously—a form of spread the bread, as it were—and none of them is held back. The colleges therefore have a wide choice of students from whom to choose and a student has a fair chance of being offered a place in one of the colleges of his or her choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
TEACH, like UCCA, requires students to list their choice of colleges in order of preference. However, unlike the English system, only the first choices are sent out. It is only when students are unsuccessful that their applications are sent on to their next choice of college. The pattern, in theory, is then repeated. Although the pattern narrows their choice somewhat, it looks as though it could work. However, many students have found out that, unless they are successful in their first choice, they do not have the opportunity to try for their second or third choices because by that time the colleges have closed their lists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A student in my constituency, who wishes to be nameless at present because she thinks that the system might operate against her if she were seen to complain about it—a sad reflection on the system—notified TEACH of her choice of five colleges which run a total of eight courses in which she wanted to be considered for placement. She was considered by only two colleges for three courses because of the system. Her first choice of college was for two courses, one primary and one secondary. She was unsuccessful, so her primary choice was passed on in late January to her second choice of primary, but its list was closed and her application was eventually sent to her third choice, in which she was unsuccessful. All the other colleges on her primary choice list had by that time closed their lists. Of her secondary applications, her first choice, although not successful, was retained by that college in case there was a cancellation.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0263">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
Therefore, it was not passed on to other colleges, and it is now much too late, because, as I have said, all the other colleges have closed their lists because they are full.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituent has no place on a teacher training course for the academic year commencing September 1991. When, concerned about her future, she telephoned TEACH, she was told, "Just have a year off, my dear, and we'll be able to fix you up next year." I find that laissez-faire attitude shocking and unacceptable. Moreover, there is no guarantee that the same will not happen in the coming application period for the 1992–93 academic year intake as long as this system applies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In its pamphlet, "Information for Candidates and Career advisers", TEACH states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Forms received before 15th December wil be given priority by the colleges when arranging their selection procedures. Candidtes submitting an application after that date may find that it is subject to some delay in processing or that colleges have closed their lists for that course."</p></blockquote>
My constituent applied early, well before 14th December. Her first interview was held in December 1990. Her current position cannot be blamed on any tardiness in making her application. The Scottish Office Education Department, in adopting the English system—of which I approve—has not been careful enough about duplication. For the sake of many hard-working students who wish to become teachers, I ask that an immediate and thorough investigation be made into the working of TEACH and that it is carried out quickly so that next year's applicants will not suffer the fate of my constituent. She has now applied to England for a course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Office Education Department should follow the UCCA system more carefully. If that system cannot be completely duplicated, the Scottish system should move closer to it because there is merit in that system. Either that, or we should revert to the former system with students having to apply directly to the colleges of their choice and taking their chances. The benefit of both suggestions is that a wider choice would be ensured for the students, and that could only be good for the Scottish education system.

	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
The Secretary of State said that the Government's objective was to advance excellence. There is a contrast between that objective and what is actually happening in the universities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give the example of one department that I visited the other day—the department of geography at the university of Edinburgh. That department has doubled its number of students in the past five years, but the teaching staff numbers have remained constant. the result is that the ratio of students to teaching staff is 18.8:1. That is higher than in many schools. The department has not been slothful in obtaining outside money. Per member of staff, it has obtained £75,000. Tutorial groups have doubled in size and are less frequent. There are 20 tutorial groups and only one is taught by a permanent member of staff. The rest are taught by graduate students. Those points are on the record. Professor David Sugden wrote to the Prime Minster on 13 May and made those points known to the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are the Government worried about the burden on individual departments, described with irrefutable facts by my hon. Friend the Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Norman A. Godman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Port Glasgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the circumstances outlined in his example from Edinburgh university not only damage the quality of teaching but also severely constrain the teachers' ability to carry out first-class research?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree emphatically, but I shall not go into that point because other hon. Members wish to speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to refer to a point raised by the right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith). I do not criticise the Government because the problem goes back a long way and concerns the medical schools. Medical schools, particularly in Glasgow and Edinburgh, are exceedingly expensive for the universities. Teachers in medical schools are paid significantly more, often far more, than their colleagues. That money has to come from general university funding. This area is shrouded in mystery. No one is clear—[	<i>Interruption</i>]. Can my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) perhaps clarify matters?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sam Galbraith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Strathkelvin and Bearsden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nobody is clear, but they are paid more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are paid significantly more which puts a tremendous strain on other faculties, such as engineering. Would it not be better at least to lift the shroud of mystery and to consider a scheme, which would have to be throughout the United Kingdom, to detach the finances of medical schools from the universities, because that is part of the trouble in Edinburgh?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another trouble is that the old and great universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh have enormous property problems. Talk to Kerr Fraser or anyone else who has to try to run the rambling university premises about the great difficulties. Many of us are worried about the low-paid janitors and other staff, without whom students and academic staff would be unable to function.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I gave notice that I would raise briefly with the Secretary of State the issue of the sale of assets. Courteously he replied that it was a matter of identification and that at the end of the day it was an internal matter for the university of Edinburgh. I must register my disagreement. I am
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0264">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
concerned about the sale of priceless assets, inevitably, abroad because no one in Scotland can afford the money involved. One should remember that, for example, Audobon came to Edinburgh. Edinburgh made it all possible between 1826–39. John Chalmers, the historian of Audobon's work, has outlined the debt that this great man and many others owed to that city. Have we really come to such a pass in the 1990s that we must sell the treasures not only of the university but of Scotland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am in danger of being something of a bad fairy. [	<i>Laughter.</i>] The university principals have agreed to the new dispensation and I cannot gainsay that, but the Secretary of State knows well that many heavyweight science professors have not agreed to it. Are we certain that the inflow of English students that has been considered desirable and of staff will be automatically what it was? Under the new dispensation would Norman Feather have come as professor of physics to Edinburgh? Would Professor Dee have come to Glasgow? Ever since the time of James Clerk Maxwell and C. T. R. Wilson, Scots have happily gone south. Would that continue? I ask that because I should have thought that the two-way traffic is extremely important. More precisely, what about the 20 per cent. of United Kingdom students? If there is a different financial system, for how long will Scotland continue to get a significantly higher proportion of students than anywhere else in the United Kingdom? If that does not happen, what happens to the financing, especially of research, in the Scottish universities? There may be an answer to that, but it must be seriously given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Frankly, we must face up to the fact that there is a price to pay for the new dispensation in terms of the United Kingdom university framework. As others wish to speak, I shall just register that I am uneasy and need much more convincing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak briefly on training and on further education and the universities. The Secretary of State gave us some interesting rhetoric from the scribes of St. Andrew's House about opening doors and windows of opportunity, but he must acknowledge that over the past few years training has gone through so many convolutions that there is scepticism about where exactly it will settle. It is accepted that over the years there has been an improvement in training and the commitment to ensure that it is worthwhile. It would be churlish not to acknowledge that. Nevertheless it has not settled yet, and as the hon. Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hughes) suggested, changes are still causing confusion and uncertainty. Until everything settles down, it will not be possible to use the superlatives that the Secretary of State uses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to cite from my constituency one small but important example, of which the Secretary of State will be aware. Huntly Training Ltd. was established in the early stages of the youth training scheme, using the facilities of the local school as its main off-the-job training patch, and was sponsored by the local rotary club. That remains a unique system not only in Scotland but in the whole United Kingdom. Eight years on, that body has become established. It is now a limited company and has been extended to cover the whole of Gordon under the new scheme. I constantly find that the managers are worried because every change affects the viability of what they do.
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
The fragility of the training that they provide in a rural area is such that national, across-the-board rules are often inappropriate. There must be flexibility and understanding in individual situations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that word of caution I welcome the fact that we are moving into what looks like a pattern of permanent provision. Having had discussions with Grampian Enterprise, I know that it is striving hard to meet the needs. In its own words, it has to hit the ground running because it had no time to prepare a plan and there is still much uncertainty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The training credit provision, compared with the real cost of training and with what is happening in virtually every other developed country, is wholly inadequate. To suggest that £1,000 per trainee is enough to achieve the high standards of training we need is questionable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same degree of uncertainty has also coloured further education colleges. The Government must acknowledge that a sudden announcement that their assets are to be frozen and transferred to central Government creates confusion among those involved in the provision, management and control of further education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government have made no such announcement. If the hon. Gentleman reads the proposals, he will find that the assets will go to the colleges themselves. If colleges wish to dispose of them, they are not frozen; colleges may dispose of them only with the consent of the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the basis of that intervention, but local authorities cannot do anything in the short term without consent. That causes anxiety. Grampian region education committee has expressed concern about how the situation can suddenly change from its being the total providers of further education to one in which that is no longer its responsibility. There is a transitional problem of how commitment will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the face of difficult situations Grampian education authority has been extremely committed to what it is doing. The Minister will be aware of the difficulties caused when it was discovered that the college of commerce building in Aberdeen was unsafe and had to be abandoned at virtually immediate notice. The facilities are now spread round the town and will remain so until a new centre, probably concentrated on the old Gordon barracks at Bridge of Don, is set up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government must accept that their record at the end of 12 years is one of constant new initiatives that have not been based on long-term planning and forward thinking. The Committee must ask whether further education should be divorced from local education authorities, about whose role there is a philosophical division. The Minister has said that the assets will go with the colleges, but in many cases those colleges have been provided by the local community, with the support of central Government, and have been tailored to serve that community. If that link is broken or weakened too much, in a few years people will ask why that degree of local accountability was relinquisbed and who caused the local community to lose the ability to say how the assets should be disposed of.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) alluded to the dispute between the university of Aberdeen and the Scottish Agricultural college. That is a serious matter which has aroused grave anxiety about the future of agricultural education and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0265">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
training in the north of Scotland. The dispute seemed to have degenerated to such a childish and petty level that I wrote to the principals of both the university and the college to see whether the problem could not be sorted out in an adult manner. The extensive replies that I received gave me no great comfort. It is not entirely flippant of me to say that my only source of satisfaction is that the date on which the notice to quit expires is the same as the date on which the principal of the university of Aberdeen demits office. That coincidence may lead to the resolution of the problem, but the delay is still too great for the urgency of the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principal of the college of agriculture detailed his anxieties in a confidential letter, from which the Committee will understand that I do not intend to quote at length. However, the arguments that it contains are fairly self-evident. The dispute has caused so much damage that, if it goes on much longer, the college will have difficulty in attracting students and providing the expected level of service. That could be serious in the long term, and raises the question of whether the university wants to continue to have a school of agriculture and to provide degree-level university education in agriculture. If not, that would be serious for the north of Scotland. It would also be a failure of the university's commitment to the community that it has served for nearly 500 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside was right to say that the irony is that the dispute is fundamentally about money and has arisen because of the change of responsibility proposed in the Williams report. Ultimately, the bill lands on the Scottish Office either way and, as the principal of the agriculture college said in his letter to me, the restoration of confidence in the college can be achieved only
	<br><blockquote><p>"through immediate Scottish Office intervention."</p></blockquote>
The Minister must recognise that heads have to be knocked together and that he must play a role in ensuring that the matter is resolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the ending of the binary divide, but worry that such reorganisation may create another set of problems. He did not make the point well, but what the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir Nicholas Fairbairn) said about the creation of new universities was valid. We are not against it in principle, but simply to convert polytechnics to universities would lead to competition and to aspirations that may not be appropriate. My personal opinion, which many share, is that the Royal College of Science and Technology had a cachet and an appeal; Strathclyde university does not have the same ring, and I speak as a graduate of that university. We cannot provide the quality of education and training that is, perhaps even higher than that which a university provides, simply by designating a college as a university. As some hon. Members said, that may be used as an excuse to level down rather than to raise standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My party has called for a separate funding body for Scottish universities for many years. The long tradition of university education in Scotland predates the union. Anyone who proposes to establish a Scottish Parliament with substantial powers should recoginse that it must be responsible for education throughout Scotland. I am glad that the universities, the Labour party and the Government now recognise that logic, but it may have come too late for many people, given the reorganisation of univerisites in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
past 10 years resulting from the severity of Government cuts. Some departments have been lost, perhaps for ever, in the need to meet the high-pressure cuts imposed on universities. That has weakened their ability to provide the breadth of degree courses—a tradition and a great strength of Scottish universities. Ironically, English institutions now aspire to that aim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The future of the Scottish four-year honours degree course has been discussed. That could be aproached more constructively when the total funding of education of Scotland is under the same umbrella. The four-year degree course is cost-effective when viewed against the background of total education provision and compared with England, where people require an extra year at school to prepare for university. That, of course, must be funded by the Department of Education and Science. The Scottish Office and the Department of Education and Science should not approach the matter from different directions and take the wrong decisions for short-term, monetary reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Arguments about the ability of Scottish unversities to atttract overseas students and high-quality academics depend on how the situation develops. I do not share the anxieties of the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) as a matter of principle. I believe that universities are properly seen to be free-standing institutions that stand on their record of academic excellence and specialisation. It is important that they continue to have access to the funds that will maintain that quality. I cannot believe that a professor of a university in the United States will be much concerned about whether the university of Edinburgh derives its broad funding from the Scottish Office or from the Department of Education and Science.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an earlier intervention in the Secretary of State's speech, I mentioned the provision of higher education in rurual areas, especially in the context of the Open university. Although that university is successful and has proved that entrance qualifications do not necessarily correlate with people's ability to gain degrees, it suffers from an inability to provide direct contact with students in more remote rural areas, especially in the north of Scotland. Will the Secretary of State consider whether more can be done to ensure that students in remote rural areas taking Open university courses have access to tutorials and direct contact with the university, comparable to that for students in more densely populated areas?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As an oblique point, I hope that consideration will be given to developing a Highland university, perhaps in association with other Scottish universities. We must recognise that such things must fit together. That is a real aspiration, and it could be fulfilled in a way that is wholly compatible with the existing university structure, while providing the access that communities in the north of Scotland need and want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With my right hon. Friend the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Sir D. Steel) by my side, may I repeat pleas that we and others have made for Newbattle Abbey? It provides for a gap, which no other institution fills. The Government should be prepared to ensure that there is enough to maintain the provision of that service and that it is not left to sink through inadequate funding or forced to stand on its own feet without any support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, Liberal Democrats have made education the No. 1 priority in our forward programme. We believe that investment in education is crucial for the future of Scotland
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0266">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
and the United Kingdom as a whole. Our party in Scotland believes that the Scottish education system has a great deal of merit and that the English system could learn from it. It is a matter of frustration and regret that, far from trying to scoticise the English system, there has been an attempt, against the clear wishes of the institutions in Scotland, to anglicise the Scottish system. That should stop forthwith. The development of the system in Scotland should proceed in a way that meets the wishes of those involved in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The priority that we give education is such that, if necessary, to meet the funding that we believe appropriate, we would be prepared to support an increase in the standard rate of income tax by 1p in the pound, specifically to invest in education. In Scottish terms, over the lifetime of a Parliament, our party is committed to the injection of £1,000 million of additional investment in Scottish education. It is for the Scottish public to decide whether that is their priority, but we are clear about it. As far as the Government's programme is concerned, all the questions have ultimately been about whether the resources will be made available. The Liberal Democrats are determined that they should be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am unique this morning as I am the only member of the Committee to whom the Secretary of State did not give way. That did not surprise me, because precisely when I sought to intervene, the right hon. Gentleman was citing the rather small number of people who seemed to agree with the Government's document, especially in respect of further education. In my experience, especially of Coatbridge college, I have not found overwhelming enthusiasm for it, from the principal to the students to the college council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a smirk from the Minister of State when the poll tax was mentioned, but I have not met anyone who has considered the Government's proposals to take further education out of local government who is not convinced that the overwhelming influence on that decision was the poll tax. If the hon. Gentleman is in any doubt about that, I refer him to the speech made in Paisley by his right hon. Friend the Member for Henley (Mr. Heseltine) which advocated the withdrawal from local government not simply of further education, but of education in its entirety. If the Minister of State doubts even that, may I reciprocate his earlier question and ask where in the Conservative manifesto for the last election did it say that further education would be withdrawn from local government? The fact is that little thought has been given to the proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that I have been able to make a short contribution as a Lanarkshire member. Given the devastation in Lanarkshire caused by unemployment and
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
the spectre of even higher unemployment and given the crucial relationship between further education and commerce and industry, I do not welcome the proposal—confirmed by the Secretary of State in his speech this morning—that those colleges that perform better than others will be held in higher regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper is scanty compared with the English and Welsh one. The photographs are better, but the text is thin. It does not mention—and neither did the Secretary of State this morning—precisely how the assessment of the performances of individual colleges will be made. In the absence of an explanation of the Government's thinking, I am worried that by credits they mean vouchers and that individual assessments and taking colleges out of local authority ambit will be the educational version of opting out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituents, especially those at Coatbridge college, and those of my hon. Friends are worried about the future of the community education service. That question has not been dealt with adequately. The Government's approach to access to education for people with special needs, women and ethnic minorities has not been properly explained. The colossal emphasis on the employer, as with Scottish Enterprise, suggests that communities have nothing to offer. Trade unions have vast experience in training, but yet again the Government intend to appoint mostly business people. Those people can take decisions, but have no local accountability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate will continue. The Secretary of State may not have given way to me today, but I shall question him further and he will hear more on the subject from Lanarkshire Members. The problems will not go away. The White Paper is not in tune with the needs of the area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) for generosity which is not often seen in this place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State said this morning that whether people were in academic education or further and vocational education, they were all held in equal esteem. Frankly, that is the kind of babble that we have heard for generations and it is not true. If further education had received anything like equal respect, it would have received the resources that it needed. It has been a grossly underfunded sector of education for many years, not only under this Government, but for decades. The White Paper does not mention extra resources for further education. That proves that there is no sincerity in the statement that all sectors are regarded equally. In the four years that I have been in the House, I do not recall a debate devoted to further education alone. It has to fight for time with the other sectors of education. That is another demonstration that further education is not taken seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State said that the choice between courses was for the students to make and that they would comprise the market force. That is nonsense. Young students coming out of school know little about the quality of courses and the choices open to them. If they do not get appropriate advice from the careers service—and that is often the case—or from knowledgeable parents or teachers, they can be left in a bad way doing an inappropriate course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State seems to be unaware that anxiety to fill places and show that colleges are doing the job leads to concentration on getting people to fill seats, with scant
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0267">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
regard, in some cases, to the suitability of the course. It is educationally unsound to enrol people for courses that are well beyond or well beneath their capacities. When employers decide between the options that are available in different colleges, they often concentrate on the skills content of a course and neither know nor care about the broader educational content. The White Paper says nothing about the wider educational needs of youngsters beyond school age, which must be considered to produce an educated work force, not merely a trained work force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[Mr. Michael J. Martin 	<i>in the Chair</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State said nothing about creche provision for women students. The Glasgow Development Agency yesterday announced that it had 160 places. I am glad, but the need is far greater than that. More places must be allocated at a price that parents can afford.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper states that the pay and conditions of each further education college will have to be negotiated locally. The Educational Institute of Scotland must feel complimented that it is regarded as such a thorn in the flesh. Technical teachers and lecturers have no experience of such matters and are not likely to be successful in local negotiations. That is what the Government are relying on, but they will rue the day when teachers become dissatisfied with their pay and conditions and there is an explosion of anger. The Government would do better to recognise the worth of the job that teachers' representatives do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was an EIS representative in my college, the main bone of contention of college lecturers was often that they were not getting the leave to take a teaching qualification. Such people could be taken on and serve years without getting the time off to qualify as teachers. Will the Secretary of State provide the resources to deal with that? If he does not, the talk of raising standards is so much eyewash and piffle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike Watson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government's two White Papers contain radical, far-reaching proposals with the potential to produce the most extensive re-organisation of post-school education in Scotland since the expansion of the universities and the creation of a central institution a quarter of a century ago. I use the word "potential" advisedly. We welcome much of the strategy for higher education, but less of the detail, such as it is. The proposals would carry more conviction if they gave the impression of forming the culmination of a well-researched, well thought-out and widely-canvassed vision of the personal developments of young Scots in the post-16 group. The proposals give no such impression.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The impetus for the devolution of Scottish universities emanates from events south of the border—the marriage of the funding bodies for universities and polytechnics and the insensitive treatment of Scottish universites by the distant paymasters of the Universities Funding Council over several years. The proposals for further education are hardly more honourable. The announcement in March of the removal of FE colleges from local authority to central control was part of a desperate attempt to regroup after the Government's humiliating retreat from the smouldering ruins of the poll tax. Yet the centralisation, with funding
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
through the Treasury from the Scottish Office, is described in the White Paper as freedom. Of course, it is precisely the opposite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The establishment of a Scottish Higher Education Funding Council is long overdue. It was advocated by the Scottish Tertiary Education Advisory Council in 1985, but rejected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why was that not in the Labour manifesto?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I took the precaution of obtaining copies of the 1987 British and Scottish manifestos from the Library. The manifesto—the first after the Scottish Tertiary Education Advisory Committee report—does not contain such a commitment. If the Labour party was so committed to the establishment of a Scottish Higher Education Funding Council why was it not included in the 1987 manifesto.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is my impression that the manifesto includes such a commitment. Perhaps the Minster has the extract of the report that specifically tackles education. The section that deals with the establishment of a Scottish Parliament refers specifically to universities. Our commitment was included in our submission to STEAC; in the Scotland Bill, which was published in November, and in our response to the Croham report. Our policy to bring universities into a Scottish context has been in place for many years, and is well documented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State rejected the outcome of STEAC and our policy until his recent conversion. Better late than never. It is clear that the distinctions between universities and the centrally-funded sector have become increasingly blurred over the past decade. University standards have been forced downwards through squeezes on staff funding, salaries and capital spending, while class sizes have increased. Meanwhile, central institutions have expanded by accepting more students and forging links with sponsors for specific courses and projects. The two sectors have converged increasingly, but a divide continues to exist between them because resources are unequally distributed. In central institutions, two of which have become polytechnics, class sizes are larger than previously and little research is carried out, while salaries and conditions are usually poorer. The White Paper makes it clear that the Government do not intend to harmonise conditions so that centrally funded colleges adopt the mantle of universities. Will the Minister define the position of colleges, such as the Dundee institute of technology, Paisley college of technology and Robert Gordon's institute of technology? Will they become universities and will they be able to validate their own courses?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To function effectively, the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council should be the responsibility of a Scottish Parliament. We believe that a Scottish Parliament will be established, possibly in two years' time. There is a danger that the Government's proposals will produce only cosmetic changes and that the funding council will act merely as an intermediary between Westminster and the various higher education institutions in Scotland. Unless the Secretary of State intends to change the way that the Scottish Office obtains its budget, the Treasury will continue to call the tune. That will create only
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0268">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
administrative devolution, which will change little. It will not improve democratic accountability in Scottish education. What meaningful say will the people of Scotland have in the process?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told that the funding council will be based on the universities Funding Council with the addition of a strong industrial and commercial element. That continues the one-sided approach that was enshrined by the formation of boards of governors in central institutions and further education college councils. When will the government wake up to the fact that not everyone in Scotland is an industrialist? Industrialists have a dismal record on training. That shows no sign of improvement, even after the formation of Scottish Enterprise. Many people in different walks of life have expertise to offer. The funding council should form a broad educational partnership and include central and local government, employers, trade unions and consumers. Why is the Scottish Office determined to narrow the options? That wastes opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should be aware of anxiety about the status of Scottish universities after the establishment of the funding council. The Committee of Scottish University Principals and the Association of University Teachers in Scotland have expressed grave fears over continued access to funding for research projects of the research councils which themselves are already underfunded. A mechanism must be established to ensure that a fair proportion of research funding reaches Scottish universities. The White Paper does not mention that important consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is absolutely right that research will be available in polytechnics and central institutions and that academics throughout higher education who want to become involved in research can do so. While that happens there must be guarantees that Scotland will at least maintain its current share of United Kingdom research.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ending of the binary divide will help to improve student access and promote co-operation in developing higher education, but the vagueness of the White Paper hardly encourages an understanding of how that will come about. That has been a recurrent theme of Opposition speakers in this debate. The White Paper on "Access and Opportunity" is especially vague. It undertakes to consider the distinctive nature of Scottish education in terms of its structure and the length of courses. I ask the Minister to give a commitment that he will do the same for research.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also anxiety over the proposals relating to further education colleges. There will be a strong case under a Scottish Parliament for planning further education centrally, but it should be administered by local authorities. Planning is a fundamental issue. The School Examinations and Assessment Council report talked of a Scottish planning and funding body. That is also the policy of the Labour party. There is no mention of planning in the White Paper and no suggestion that the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council should take on such a role. What will happen as regards planning? Who will co-ordinate overall? The Minister must answer those questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no question of additional resources in the further education sector. Following the publication of the two White Papers the Secretary of State has concentrated on discussing the "Access and Opportunity" White Paper, which has a narrow vision of the role that further education colleges can play. Further education provision is seen as
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
totally dominated by employers' needs. The White Paper does not advance thinking on further education; it is little more than a glossy repackaging of previous statements on vocational education provision. It talks of developing more broadly based vocational qualifications within the Scottish vocational qualifications network, SCOTVEC, which is all very well, but it is ill-defined and not developed in any way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My colleagues have commented on the short time that there has been to evaluate training credits. My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hughes) made the point from his own experience. We do not know whether they will work, yet they seem to be the source of considerable funding on the basis of a one month trial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ideology underpinning the White Paper is starkly revealed. The control of curriculum and resources has been delivered into the hands of a small, unrepresentative and unaccountable group of private employers. Not only are all other interests ignored, but the values that characterise the system foster short-term limited skills induction of immediate benefit mainly to employers, but of little lasting benefit to either the learner as an individual or society as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The narrowness of the concept of further education is illustrated by the fact that liberal non-vocational education has no place in Government policy. Nowhere in either of the White Papers do the phrases, "adult education" or "continuing education" appear. Worse still, paragraph 7.4 of "Access and Opportunity" refers dismissively to "social and recreational education" as if it were of no value whatever. We see enormous potential in a well-funded service offering people the knowledge, basic skills and confidence to improve their quality of life. Having worked for three years in adult education, I appreciate its value and want to see it developed. On 31 May 	<i>The Times Higher Education Supplement</i> stated in relation to the White Paper:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is a philistine principle to suppose that there is no public interest at stake in the desire of very many adults to improve their understanding and appreciation of the world and themselve, unconstrained by vocational pathways."</p></blockquote>
For many people adult education is the first cautious step back into what they remember as a negative concept. Local authorities often provide the vital access through community colleges, as do voluntary bodies, most notably the Workers Educational Association, who describe that function as a recovery and relay system for adults wanting to re-enter the education system but lacking the confidence to walk into a college of further education and enrol for a mainstream course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Placing all the emphasis on the college mode, as the White Paper, does, will deny some people the right to reaccess the education system. That represents a wasted opportunity. It is wrong to suggest that getting a SCOTVEC qualification is all that matters. For many people it is important, but for others the opportunity to reorient themselves and give something back to the community is equally important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The suggestion in the White Paper that full cost fees must be charged by further education colleges for all non-vocational courses would have the effect of slamming the door in the faces of many people—young, and not-so-young—who have the potential to benefit from education. The impression given by both White Papers is that the Government want education on the cheap. They want to keep education policy within a narrow vision of what can be done in the most cost-effective manner.

The White Papers contain radical proposals but they do not provide the key to unlock the door to enable young people who want to benefit from Scottish education to reach the limit of their potential.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. Watson) on his first speech from the Front Bench and I welcome the points of agreement that he singled out. The hon. Gentleman reinforced my belief that politicians do not read their own manifestos when they stand for election, but as the hon. Gentleman entered the House after 1987, he at least has an excuse that the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) does not. The Labour party's manifesto contained nothing about these important proposals, which have been widely welcomed throughout Scotland. The proposals provide for equality of competition between all higher education institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Central and others asked me to comment on Paisley, Dundee and Robert Gordon's institutes of technology. We are consulting, but it is difficult to consult and draw conclusions at the same time. Those three colleges and the two polytechnics have accredited status by CNAA. That will be an important criterion in deciding whether they should have their own degree-awarding powers. University status is a separate point and further consultation is being held on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Clydebank and Milngavie and for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) let the cat out of the bag in showing that they had no understanding of the proposals. The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie talked about levelling universities down to polytechnics. That view was echoed by the hon. Member for Gordon. Implicit in that view is the snobbery and elitism that the proposals are meant to sweep away. It implies that vocational qualifications have a lesser importance or grade than academic qualifications. The two White Papers are about raising the status of vocational qualifications and giving them a standing alongside academic qualifications. The failure of Opposition Members to appreciate that goes to the heart of their failure to deal with points raised in the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was referring to levels of expenditure. We want an assurance that there will not be further levelling down of universities to polytechnic standards—a matter covered by the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir N. Fairbairn) when he implied that polytechnics might even want to acquire libraries. Will the Minister give an assurance that long before legislation is introduced the status of the Dundee, Robert Gordon's and Paisley colleges will be known, so that there is not this blight?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, I assure the hon. Gentleman that the status of those colleges will be made known as soon as consultations have been completed and as soon as is practically possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has made a remarkable admission. He said that he was referring to levels of expenditure. It is not the number of students, their qualifications or how well they are prepared for the world of work that matters to him, but how much money is spent. What an extraordinary
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
statement, especially as he would not say how much extra the Labour party is prepared to commit to higher education in Scotland. I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman if he is prepared to tell the Committee how much extra the Labour party will put on the table. The hon. Gentleman used most of his speech to criticise the Government for the resources that we are making available for higher and further education. I give him the opportunity to say how much the Labour party will provide and he sits on his hands. At least the hon. Member for Gordon made it perfectly clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Labour party was in office and increased spending, the numbers of young Scots—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and the hon. Gentleman will probably have to wait at least another 12 years for the chance to govern if this is the quality of argument that the Labour party puts to the electorate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the Labour party's period of office, the number of young Scots entering full-time education fell by 4 per cent. In this Government's period of office, the number entering higher education increased by 46 per cent to the highest level in our history. That is the Government's record; the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie is more concerned about how much money is spent than about how many youngsters are given the opportunity of higher education, in which this Government take pride.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister satisfied with the present level of funding for Scottish universities or does he believe that the principals are merely whingeing an whining and have no legitimate cause for complaint? If the Minister thinks that it is legitimate for a party to give precise figures for future expenditure, will he tell us what will be the expenditure on Scottish universities under the new system?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asked about the general and the particular. The views on funding of the principal of St. Andrews university are different to those of the principal of Edinburgh university. The Government do not measure the success of the education system by the input of resources, but by its output—the number of students who go into higher education, which is at record levels. We measure success too, by the qualifications attained by school leavers—they are the best in our history and had the highest growth in the past three years—and by the numbers of people involved in higher education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>Rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman if he will tell me how much his party will provide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have asked the hon. Gentleman to help me with his plans; he is in Government. I ask him to answer my question not to talk about specific vice-chancellors. The vice-chancellors committee that speaks corporately for all vice-chancellors is bitterly critical of the level of university finance. Is that committee talking out of the back of its head from jealousy, or is its criticism justified?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For as long as I have been in the House, the university principals have argued for more resources, which have been applied to produce more students and more from the universities. The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie condemns the higher education

organisations for becoming more efficient and attracting more students within the available resources. I am happy to stand on our record for the provision of resources. Resources for higher education have increased in real terms more than 10 per cent in Scotland. The hon. Gentleman is still not prepared to tell us what Labour will do. That is because the hon. Member for Monklands, who was present earlier, will not allow him to make expenditure commitments. By the time the hon. Gentleman—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. The hon. Gentleman referred to me. I put no such restriction on my hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By the time that the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie has finished buying off the interest rates, there will be even less available for higher education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) asked whether there should be an appeal against the HMI report. The hon. Gentleman knows that senior managers have an opportunity to discuss HMI reports with the inspectors before publication. It would break down the independence of the system if the reports were subject to gagging or to an appeals process as the hon. Gentleman suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Angus, East asked who would be in charge of further education bursaries. He will find the answer to that question in paragraph 72 of the White Paper. It was clear from their questions that some hon. Members had not read the White Paper. The hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) complained that it was rather thin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Angus, East talked about the most educated dole queues in the world. What a way to run down his country. If he studied the dole queues, he would see that a large proportion of the long-term unemployed have basic problems with literacy and numeracy. More is the pity that the hon. Gentleman opposes to such an extent five to 14-year-old testing which would ensure that learning difficulties were identified early and dealt with in primary and secondary schools. The hon. Gentleman also referred to college assets being frozen until 1993. The White Paper makes it perfectly clear that colleges will be able to dispose of assets with the consent of the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With characteristic perspicacity the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) pointed out that a difficulty arose with devolution of responsibility: it might mean that the enjoyment of continued extra funding would not be possible. My right hon. Friend has made it clear that the proposals will not have that effect. However, if the Opposition Front Bench were ever to take office and a Scottish Assembly were made responsible for the funding councils, it could generate extra resources only by increasing income tax in the form of an assembly tax for Scottish people. The hon. Gentleman's worry about the quality of higher education can extend to health and housing. It comes from his party's proposals, to which he has such an honourable record of opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Monklands, West asked about FE colleges and said that little thought had been given to them. I am astonished that the Labour party has not mentioned its much-trumpeted policies announced today by the hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw) in 	<i>The Times.</i> Every time that we have a debate in the Scottish Grant Committee, the hon. Gentleman seems to launch education initiatives through the columns of 	<i>The Times.</i> I do not
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
know whether the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngarie has had the opportunity to read the proposals. South of the border the Labour party seems to be saying that FE colleges are to be corporate colleges run as charitable institutions with day-to-day control over their own affairs. Precisely those proposals were introduced in the Self-Governing Schools etc. (Scotland) Act 1989 which the hon. Gentleman and others strongly opposed, yet, now, the hon. Member for Blackburn embraces them as Labour policy. Does that policy apply in Scotland or has it been hurriedly thought out in the way that the hon. Member for Monklands, West accused ours of being?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister is comparing documents published in England with those published in Scotland, will he clarify the Government's position in relation to Scotland in respect of the English document "Education and Training for the 21st century", which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"But it will not be appropriate for colleges to have on their governing bodies representatives of local authorities."</p></blockquote>
That has not been said in the Scottish document. What is the Government's position in relation to Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is aware that we are consulting on that matter. I have an open mind. If hon. Gentlemen wish to make the case, I am happy to listen. If the hon. Gentleman is saying that Labour party policy says that colleges in England can be trusted to have corporate status and to be independent but not those in Scotland, what does the Labour party have against FE colleges in Scotland? Why cannot they be trusted with that opportunity? The Labour party in Scotland is reduced to a party with no policies. It seeks to misrepresent Government policies at every turn and to claim credit for policies that prove popular. It is being led by the hon. Member for Blackburn to embrace policies that Opposition Members have denounced in Committee. South of the border the Labour party recognises that if decision making can be devolved to local level and if colleges and universities can be freed and given income according to their ability to attract students, we shall set up a more responsive system that will prepare our children for the 1990s. This Government is committed to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
