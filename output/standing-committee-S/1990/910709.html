	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Tim Yeo)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That the Committee has considered the draft North Hull Housing Action Trust (Area and Constitution) Order 1991.</p></q>
I very much welcome this opportunity to debate the order. It is a chance for us to examine what the Government are doing for the city of Hull, especially for the tenants in the area covered by the housing action trust. I welcome also the opportunity to examine the enormous attractions that the Government's housing action trusts policy now offers. It is very timely that the Committee is discussing this matter today as the ballot, which is due to take place in Waltham Forest, on the possibility of a HAT being established there, will commence on Saturday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that HATs are an idea whose time has clearly come. That is not something that is recognised only by the Government. I am glad to say that there are now some members of the Labour party who have begun to see the merits of HATs. Only two weeks ago Liverpool city council—that well-known group of moderates, which has been endorsed regularly in the last few weeks by the right hon. Member for Islwyn (Mr. Kinnock)—asked whether it could open negotiations with the Conservative Government about the possibility of establishing a HAT in Liverpool.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Hull the HAT is the result not only of the freely expressed wishes of the tenants but also of an initiative taken by the Labour council. The Labour party, in some parts of the country at least, is starting to accept the Conservative philosophy of HATs. We are always ready to welcome new converts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning will be a good opportunity for the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) to explain what his position, and that of his party on the Opposition Front Bench, is on HATs. The Committee will look forward to that because on this issue, as on so many others, the Labour party's position is extremely confused. I look forward to hearing whether the hon. Gentleman stands by his previously stated commitment to disband HATs, or whether he is beginning to—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Soley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hammersmith)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure why the Minister is waiting for me to speak when he can read it in the hook. You will remember, Mr. Knox—I believe that you were the Chairman of the Standing Committee that considered the Housing Bill in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
1988—that I put on record then the changes that the Government would need to make in order for us to accept them. The Government have now made those changes—it is on the record—but significantly the Government voted against those changes in 1988.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that intervention. It is an important clarification, in the light of the hon. Gentleman's comments in the 	<i>Hull Daily Mail</i> on 14 May of this year, when he said that a Labour Government—not a very likely eventuality, as I am sure the Committee will agree—would disband housing action trusts. He is quoted as saying that Labour party policy is not to support them—that it would wind them up. Is that what he is now saying?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have said that HATs would not be continued under a Labour Government, and I will elaborate on that in due course. The Minister should read 	<i>Hansard.</i> Is he suggesting that the 	<i>Hull Daily Mail</i>—which, for all I know, might be a very good paper—has put the position as fully as 	<i>Hansard?</i> If he accepts that it has not, why does not he read 	<i>Hansard</i> and see what he and his colleagues voted against at the time, which is precisely what they are now putting forward?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a desperate attempt by the hon. Gentleman to back pedal on his comments in the 	<i>Hull Daily Mail.</i> Although hon. Members may refer to 	<i>Hansard</i> in great detail, I guess that the average tenant in Hull may find the hon. Gentleman's comments in the 	<i>Hull Daily Mail</i> a sufficient indicator of his position, which clearly remains extremely confused. He has told the Committee that he would not continue the HATs, although he claims that the changes that the Government have made to their original proposal four years ago are sufficient for him to accept them. Obviously, he seems to be in a muddle. I am sure that the tenants in Hull will be glad to have the clarification that a Labour Government would not continue the housing action trust, regardless of the fact that those tenants voted by a substantial majority—69 per cent. out of a 77 per cent. turnout—in favour of the HAT proposal. They must be disappointed to know that the official Labour spokesman still intends to disband the HAT. Has the hon. Gentleman consulted his Front-Bench colleague, the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott)? In a letter circulated to tenants, he said:
	<br><q><p>The trust proposals give you the opportunity to make North Hull the flagship estate of the city."</p></q>
The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East seems to be a strong supporter of the HAT; I am sorry that both he and the hon. Member for Hammersmith cannot get together to establish a more coherent position on the issue. I am sure that there will he great interest in Hull, Liverpool and elsewhere on the hon. Gentleman's views on HATs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The HAT area forms part of the North Hull estate. It contains 2,436 dwellings, of which 2,109 are council owned; the remainder are owner occupied, as a result of purchases under the right-to-buy scheme. The area consists almost entirely of unimproved, traditional inter-war semi-detached and terraced houses. Social
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0438">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
and economic problems are markedly worse than the city average. The houses and the environment are in a state of considerable disrepair. The houses lack basic modern facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the potential of the area, as Hull's economic base gradually diversfies, is an important factor and the HAT will establish strong links with the Orchard Park and North Hull local economic initiative, which the city and county councils have set up to create new economic activity, jobs and an improved qualtiy of life for local people. The city council saw the HAT as the right vehicle to ensure the regeneration of the estate, before the spiral of decline accelerated out of control. The council took the initiative of producing a feasibility study and of approaching the Government. Between November 1990 and January 1991, we agreed a policy framework with the council, and the council intensified its consultation with residents. Ministers supported the effort by appointing a shadow board for the HAT. That board has embarked on an intensive programme of meetings with tenants, the city council, the county council and other voluntary and statutory bodies. A community planning weekend was sponsored by the shadow HAT from 17 to 21 May to start open discussions on all relevant issues among residents, the city council, the shadow HAT and service providers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government attach special importance to tenant involvement. Consultation with tenants is a key part of any HAT proposal. Although the North Hull tenants and residents association has existed only since January, when it was created in response to the proposal. the chairman and the secretary, who are members of the shadow board, have actively and positively supported the HAT proposals. A major aim of the strategy is to encourage greater tenant participation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once the order is approved and the HAT is formally establsihed, local authority housing within the designated area will be transferred to the HAT, on terms to be agreed with the city council. I hope that that can be done by around the end of this year. The order will allow about £50 million to be released to be spent on the homes, in a programme of major physical, social and economic regeneration. I commend both Hull city council and the shadow board of the HAT, under the enthusiastic and energetic chairmanship of David Liggins, for always putting tenants' interests first. The proposals will unquestionably bring enormous benefit to the tenants and to Hull as a whole. It deserves the Committee's full support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.38 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel sorry for you, Mr. Knox, because you will have to listen again to the arguments that I put forward several years ago, and which I shall repeat for the benefit of the Minister and Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said to the Minister for Housing and Planning on the floor of the House the other day, the problem is that in recent years, no housing Minister has stayed in the job for more than six months—except for the present incumbent who has been there for eight months. That is why they do not know the background to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
issue. It is important that I take them through it, not least because I want the Government to give some commitments today. The Minister will know that I am saying exactly what I have been saying for the last three years. My arguments on the Housing Bill in 1988 are clearly and concisely recorded in 	<i>Hansard,</i> where the votes are also recorded. As Chairman of that Committee, Mr. Knox, you may recall that the Government are now offering something that they voted down time and again in the Standing Committee that considered the Bill and in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me go back to the beginning, because there is a very important issue at stake. The Secretary of State for the Environment at the time, the right hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley), devised housing action trusts as one of several ways to get local authorities out of providing council housing. That was part of the Government's philosophy then—and still is, as I understand it. Tenants, mainly from the Lambeth HAT but, I think. also from elsewhere, eventually obtained a copy of the consultancy document written by Peat, Marwick, McLintock, which had advised the Government on the issue. That document clearly stated—indeed a diagram was included to demonstrate how it should be done—that the purpose of HATs was the successful transfer of council properties to the private sector. Tenants were deeply angry at such a surreptitious attempt to push them into the private sector. If the Minister has consulted his hon. Friend, the then Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, the hon. Member for Rossendale and Darwen (Mr. Trippier), he will know how angry the tenants were. To his credit, the then Under-Secretary went to some of the tenants' meetings—which he described as very difficult—at which he was shouted down by the tenants time and again. The tenants were angry not only about the transfer but about other issues, including rent levels and the right to buy. They were also angry about the way in which the housing action trust was being set up by the then Secretary of State, allowing the tenants practically no rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the tenants in all seven areas identified by the Government as needing HATs—we must remember that those areas were very run down—voted against the proposals. I think that the Minister will not disagree. I see that he does not. As shadow housing Minister, I took a group of colleagues who represented those areas to see the then Under Secretary, the hon. Member for Rossendale and Darwen, who was dealing with the matter. We suggested to the Minister that HATs could not possibly work because they forced people to become private sector tenants instead of council tenants and because they provided insufficient guarantees on consultation with tenants, rent levels and other such issues. I put it to the Minister—as I put it to him when I discussed the matter in Hull—that if he made some attempt to deal with those key issues, although we did not believe that HATs were the way to regenerate housing, we would accept the position as tolerable, provided that the tenants voted in favour of the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Hull authority said that it wanted to enter the scheme I had no objections, provided that it could
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0439">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
secure the sort of deal that the then Under-Secretary said that he would consider. I was prepared to go along with that, as long as the tenants voted for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury then left his ministerial job, the former. Prime Minister was ditched by the Government, and their policies began to change. They attempted to woo the tenants. I welcomed that, because the Government had so consistently treated tenants as second-class citizens that any attempt to get them to talk to the Government and give them a real say was to be welcomed. To give credit to the Minister for Housing and Planning, he does at least listen to the views of tenants and others. That is a fundamental difference between the Minister and previous housing Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following my visit to the hon. Member for Rossendale and Darwen, with other Labour Members of Parliament, and after the tenants of all the HAT identified by the Government had voted against the schemes, the Government knew that HATS had failed in their original aim and structure. They therefore suggested major changes. The Minister knows that the tenants voted against the scheme—that is not in dispute—and that the Government then came up with new proposals, which both I and the tenants welcome. What have the tenants in those HAT areas, which have been identified by that Government as most in need of money, done wrong, which means that they cannot be offered the deal that is now being offered to Hull? May I have a specific answer to that question?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and the Government have dramatically changed their previous position. They have done so not because of my comments—although they helped—but because the tenants said no. It is only vindictiveness that is preventing the Government from offering the new deal to those tenants. Will they now offer the new deal to those tenants? By the Government's own definition, those estates were highlighted as the ones most in need of the money. The Government did not identify Hull, or Liverpool. I am not saying that those areas do not have problems, because they do, but nobody would dispute that other areas—Sandwell and Southwark, for example, or the Lambeth estates—desparerately need money. The Government are not offering money to them. They will not admit that they got it wrong and offer a new package to those estates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said—and I welcome his conversion—that he wished tenants to be more involved. That is good news. However, one of the Government's difficulties was what would happen to estates in the future: would they be returned to the council and would tenants have places on the boards? The Government replied that they could not guarantee that: legislation would be required. The Minister has made verbal commitments, but he has not been in his job very long and, judging by previous experience, will not be in it for much longer. May we have a commitment that, at the earliest opportunity, the Government will put into primary legislation the verbal commitments that are not legally enforceable at the moment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the reasons why tenants are deeply angry and upset about the treatment of housing action trusts by the Government is that they know that most—but not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
all—of the commitments given by the Government will not be legally binding. If a board were to decide to ignore the ministerial commitments, Ministers could do nothing about it other than try to persuade the board. Legally, the hoard will he entitled not to pass the estate back to the council, even if that is what the tenants want but to sell it to the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My two questions to the Minister are, first, about the tenants in other housing action trust areas identified by the Goverment and, secondly, whether he will put into primary legislation the commitment that he voted down in Committee but that he is now prepared to offer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister wanted to be told about the Labour party's position. He has it. It was placed on record in 	<i>Hansard</i> three years ago. As I have told Hull and Walthamstow and as I told the Committee three years ago, we do not think that housing action trusts—which have powers to override local authorities and to sell off not only land with housing on it but parks and other areas, and which also have planning powers—are a good way to regenerate such areas. They will override local democracy. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I notice that the Minister is laughing. Does he think that north Hull has no local democracy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am worried about local democracy. The hon. Gentleman has been on his feet for 10 minutes. Will he say clearly whether the Labour party intends to accept the wishes of the majority of tenants in north Hull, who have the support of the Labour city council and of the local Labour Member of Parliament? Will he give a clear commitment that the Labour party will not disband that trust? By any criteria, the housing action trust is in the interests of those tenants who voted for it and is their democratic wish. Does the hon. Gentleman accept that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister, if he has been listening, will have heard me say that we do not think that housing action trusts are right, because they override local democracy. We still have a local democratic structure in this country, even after 11 or 12 years of disastrous Conservative Governments. Our democratic structure is not as good as is in Europe. Governments of many European countries are constitutionally unable to override local authority powers, not least in Germany whose constitution we wrote because we feared centralised control. Conservative Governments have reinforced centralised control in this country. We say that the HAT will be wound up, after consultation with the tenants and the council. Any outstanding work will be completed. We have made that clear. We want the money to be directed into housing schemes, as priorities dictate. Local authorities will have that role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The critical point is something that I have made clear many times over the past couple of years. I have put it in writing to both Walthamstow and Hull. Tenants will have the right under a Labour Government, as will tenants of housing associations and—in limited ways—private sector tenants, to change to another landlord. In other words, if the tenants in the Hull housing action trust area did not want to go hack to the council but wanted to form a housing co-operative, or a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0440">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
housing association or some such structure, they could. If they wanted to go back to the council, they could. We shall put that in legislation. The Minister will not—unless he now gives a guarantee to me that he will put it into primary legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister confirm that I am right to say that if the HAT board chose to go against what the Minister has offered Hull and dediced to sell off the estate to the private sector, there is nothing that anyone could do to stop it? That is right, is it not? I take it from his silence that the Minister agrees that it is. Legally, the board can sell off whatever it likes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government have made it clear—I am glad to have the chance to confirm it—that when the work of the housing action trust has been completed, the tenants will be given the opportunity to choose what they want to do. They already have a legal right under the Government's tenants' choice policy to choose a landlord other than the council. The intention is that at the end of the period tenants will decide whether they wish the local authority to be their landlord again, whether they wish to form a housing association, or whatever. That will be their choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is feeble. The Minister made a subtle slip. He said that tenants would have the right to go away from the council, but they are no longer with the council. They are with the HAT. The legal position is that the tenants' houses can be sold off by the trust. In a year of two, the trust could decide that the best thing to do with one part of the estate would be to sell it to a private developer. It could do that. The Minister could not stop it. He can bleat on as long as he likes about wanting to do what tenants want him to do, but neither he nor any tenant could stop that happening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It must be clear, even to the most simpleminded observer, that the Government are trying to do what the tenants want. The tenants have voted in favour of a housing action trust. The democratically elected city council has decided in favour of a HAT. The local Member of Parliament is in favour of a HAT. All those people are responding to the democratically expressed wishes of the tenants. Only the Labour party is committed to overthrowing the freely expressed wishes of the tenants in north Hull. I am glad that the hon. Member for Hammersmith has confirmed that he does not care about local democracy. He talked nonsense about centralised control. The Labour party is determined to ride roughshod over the tenants' wishes, as expressed in the ballot, and over the wishes of the elected council and the local Member of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whether or not they are members of a housing action trust, under the Labour scheme tenants will have the right to choose their landlord. The Minister admits, through what he leaves out, that the legal position is that, however the tenants voted, the HAT board could sell their homes. Never mind what the Minister, or Parliament, wants—that is the legal position. The judge in a court case does not read 	<i>Hansard</i> to find out what the Minister wants. He reads the law. The law is that the HAT board can sell any part of the HAT that it wants to sell to whomsoever it likes. Is that right or wrong—legally?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Tenants will know that at every stage of the process here, and in the other areas where HATs have been proposed, the Government have abided strictly by the wishes of the tenants, expressed in a ballot. The Government will not reverse that position. We shall continue to abide by their wishes, unlike the hon. Gentleman who is determined to overthrow this housing action trust because of dogma and doctrinaire attitudes that have nothing to do with the interests of the tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Hammersmith is so fussed about this point—which is almost entirely irrelevant, as it is the Government who are determined to do what the tenants wish—I am glad to tell him that if a suitable opportunity arose for us to enshrine in legislation the right of tenants to choose their new landlord and to end a housing action trust, the Government would be perfectly happy to grant that right. It is the Government who are determined to do what the tenants want, unlike the hon. Gentleman who keeps dodging the question, since it is clear that he would override the wishes of the tenants and get rid of this housing action trust.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is terribly painful to watch the horse being dragged so unwillingly to the water. The position is not what the Government want or like but the legal position, as set out in the 1988 Act. Right now, housing action trusts can be sold off. The nearest I got to a concession was just now when the Minister said that he was glad to tell me that the Government would try to give tenants the right to choose their own landlord, whenever a chance arises to do so. I wecome that, but I want to see it enshrined in legislation. I do not trust this Government—nor do many tenants, which is why they voted down the housing action trust.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Knox.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a point of order; it is a point of debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But it is a fact that a substantial majority of the tenants in Hull voted in favour of the housing action trust. It is most mischievous of the hon. Gentleman to suggest otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is wriggling again. He knows that all seven areas that were identified as housing action trusts by the Government voted against them. The reason to which I am referring now was one of the most important reasons why they did so. What the Minister has now said, which is different, is that he and the Government have changed their mind and want to give the tenants this right. I welcome that. He says that he will put it into legislation. I welcome that, too. But it raises the question why all his hon. Friends—and I suspect, the Minister too—voted on the Floor of the House against that very proposition when my hon. Friends and I advanced it in 1988. Why did he vote against it then? Why is he now saying that he will try to find the opportunity to put it into legislation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although it might be hard for a reader of these proceedings to understand it, we are actually

talking about Hull and a proposal for 1991. We are still waiting for a clear answer from the hon. Gentleman to the question why the Labour party has now committed itself to overturning the freely-expressed wishes of the tenants of north Hull. Those tenants voted by a substantial majority in favour of the housing action trust and were supported by the city council and their Member of Parliament. Why is the Labour party so determined to overthrow their wishes?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may correct the hon. Gentleman on one point, he has been at some pains to tell us how experienced he is in housing matters, but he should be aware that Hull is only the third case, not the seventh, where the proposal for a housing action trust has led to a ballot. There were two previous ballots, which went against the housing action trust.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is even worse than that. The Minister forgets, incidentially, the votes that the tenants organised for themselves; he forgets them because, to him, tenants do not really, matter. The Government were so appalled at the risk of failure by tenants to vote for their proposal, as opposed to ballots organised by the tenants themselves, that they chose not even to hold ballots. They simply took money away from estates that, according to their own definition, were some of the worst estates in the country and told them that they could not have it back. That shows their concern for tenants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->: 	<div class='membercontribution'>	<i>rose</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister gets up again in a desperate attempt to protect Government policy, let me point out to him the one way out that he has, apart from changing the law in the way I have described. He was not directly responsible then, but he should read the 1988 debates. He would have been able to get this matter dealt with quickly if he had said that he accepted that some of the arguments put forward by the Government then were wrong, that they had voted the wrong way and that they are now putting it right. Had the Minister said that, we could all have been downstairs having a coffee by now. I would have welcomed such an announcement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party says that local democracy is what matters. We shall wind up housing action trusts, in full consultation with the tenants and councils involved. The tenants will have a vote as to what they want to do in the future—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Against the council's wishes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. That has been part of our policy for some years. There is no problem about that. There is a problem for the Government, because the housing action trust does only what the Minister says. The test for the Minister is twofold. First, he should put it in primary legislation. We shall then be able to believe it, which we cannot at present, because of the Govern-men's history on housing. Secondly, will he now offer money to those other organisations on the present terms, not the terms on offer in 1988 or 1989 when tenants so angrily dismissed them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ronnie Fearn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Southport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we may return to the subject before us: north Hull. I am interested in the management of the housing action trust there. We are not against housing action trusts where tenants say that they want one. In this case the Minister said that the turn out was 77 per cent. How many people voted for and how many voted against? How many units of accommodation does the HAT comprise? The map does not tell us that. I am also interested in the board; it holds the key to whatever happens. How many tenants would be on the board?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.1 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Pendry 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stalybridge and Hyde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the hon. Member for Southport (Mr. Fearn). I was not going to make this speech, which could be an hour long, until I heard that very bullish speech from the Minister. I want to be slightly more charitable than my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley). I think that we must put it down to the Minister's inexperience. We must recognise from all his comments that he is an inexperienced Minister in the Department. We should be a little concerned about that. I caution my hon. Friend not to follow the Minister's bullish style. The Minister accused my hon. Friend of being dogmatic, but the Minister seems to be much more dogmatic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members live in the real housing world that has been created by the Government. We have changed our attitude about this trust because of the changes that the Goverment have been forced to make. There are 4,400 houses on the estate and 69 per cent. of those who turned out voted for the trust, but they did so because of the changes that have been forced upon the Government. The Government have backtracked. When it was introduced, the tenants were to have no seats on the board. Now they have two seats. That is only two seats out of 11, but at least there has been some movement as a result of pressure, not least from the Opposition. The local authorities were to have no involvement at the beginning, now the board is being led by Hull city council as much as by anyone. Indeed, the chairman of housing on that authority is the vice-chairman of the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have been vague in the past about rent levels. Now, because of the pressure that has been exerted, they have said that rent levels are to he frozen until the improvements take place. The original proposal raised the spectre of private landlords, but we have just heard an interesting dialogue between the Minister and my hon. Friend about the fact that countrol could be returned to the council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When he replies in less bullish tones, the Minister must confirm that legislation will be introduced to put that into clear form. Many of the 69 per cent who voted in favour of the housing action trust did so in the belief that their properties would be able to be returned to the council. They probably did not read all the papers, but they believed that control could return to the council and that funds would be made available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must give us those assurances today. He must also reassure us that the six other authorities
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0442">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
will be given the same facilities and offers of assistance as Hull has received. Hull has received £50 million; comparable estates should be given similar assistance from the Department of the Environment. I do not want to make an hour-long speech, as it is clear that the Minister has cooled down a bit and that he will respond positively to points made by Opposition Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.5 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Far from cooling down, I am even more confirmed in my support for the tenants of north Hull than I was 35 minutes ago. Tenants in north Hull, Waltham Forest, Liverpool and areas where a housing action trust is hoped for, will study the comments of the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) with great interest. It is clear that, regardless of their wishes, he is determined to impose Labour party doctrine on them. That doctrine is that if a measure is good for the tenants and in any way weakens the monopoly control of the local authority, the Labour party is against it. That has always been the Labour party view—and sadly it still is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To answer the question of the hon. Member for Southport (Mr. Fearn), out of the 2,553 ballot papers issued in north Hull, 1,977 were returned. Of those, 11 were spoilt. That gives a turnout of 77 per cent. Some 1,363 were in favour; 603 were against. Therefore 69 per cent of the votes cast—about 53 per cent of those eligible to vote—were in favour. Regardless of that overwhelming free expression of tenants' wishes, the Labour party is determined to override them. It will ride roughshod over them; it will wind up the housing action trust. It is not interested in the democratically expressed views of the tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sadly for the Labour party, even the local Labour city council, which has 58 Labour members and only two Opposition members—an unhealthy situation, surely—is in favour of the houising action trust. The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Mr. McNamara) who sits on the Oppsition Front Bench alongside the hon. Member for Hammersmith, is also in favour of it. No one who has any democratic interest in the matter is opposed to the North Hull housing action trust. That unfortunately does not stop the hon. Member for Hammersmith charging ahead, due to his determination to abolish the trust and thus substantially damage the interests of the tenants in north Hull.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is regrettable that at no stage did the hon. Gentleman give any reason for his determination to ignore the wishes of the tenants. I can only charitably assume that he is so ashamed of the reasons that he has decided not to give them. We shall ensure that the tenants in north Hull continue to get what we believe is in their interest, which is a housing action trust—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Clelland 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tyne Bridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the interests of the tenants, before the trust decides on the future ownership and control of all or part of its properties, will the Minister ensure that tenants are legally entitled to he balloted on the proposal and that the proposal will include the right of tenants to revert to being tenants of the local authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is astonishing that Opposition Members keep saying that they want more tenants' ballots. After
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
they have gone on record as saying that official Labour party policy is to ignore the wishes of tenants, as expressed in a ballot, what is the purpose of asking for yet more ballots?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason is simple. A document paid for by the Secretary of State for the Environment and costing £21 million, clearly and graphically showed, with tables, that the Government's aim was to transfer council stock to the private sector. That is why we want guarantees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I doubt whether the tenants will he impressed by pleas for more ballots from a party that has declared itself determined to ignore ballots that have already taken place. If the Labour party changed its position and gave its full support to the tenants and their views, there might be some credibility behind its pleas. While the official position of the Labour party is to ignore the fact that the tenants have voted in favour of the housing action trust, there is no point in pressing for more ballots, unless it is that the Labour party wishes to have further opportunities to override the democratic wishes of tenants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The tenants will have a legal entitlement to a vote, under the Labour system. Will the Minister give them that entitlement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is in favour of local democracy, why is he so determined to override the tenants' wishes that have already been expressed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason is that under the Government's system, the tenants have only one vote. The ticket out of council control is only one way. After that, the tenants would have no further vote. The Labour system would give them further votes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I explained earlier in the debate, if there is an opportunity we shall be happy to enshrine in legislation the right of the tenants to vote on their new landlord at the end of the housing action trust. While we await such an opportunity, I wish to make it clear that the Government intend to allow tenants, at the end of the housing action trust, to decide who their landlord should be. If the tenants wish to go back to Hull city council, they can. If they wish to form a housing association, they can. They will also retain their right to buy. The tenants will decide on their future individually, at the conclusion of the housing action trust.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it right that if the board decides in 12 months' time to sell off part of the area, the Minister cannot stop it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I can. The board cannot transfer any property out of the trust without the consent of the Secretary of State. On behalf of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment, I wish to make it clear that consent would not be forthcoming to any transfer that was against the wishes of the tenants. Unlike the hon. Gentleman, who has made it clear that the Labour party will look for opportunities to override
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0443">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
the wishes of the tenants, the Government will not give that consent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The legal position is that the board cannot transfer a certain number of properties without the consent of the Secretary of State, but it can transfer or sell land with housing on it without consent. What the board cannot do is sell the entire housing stock without first obtaining consent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a convoluted argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But it is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is an extraordinary argument from a party that is determined to override the vote that has taken place. The Government have acted, are acting and will act in accordance with the wishes of tenants. We shall permit nothing to be done that is against the wishes of the tenants. We are determined to ensure that the maximum amount of tenant consultation and participation in decision making takes place at each stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to the point raised by the hon. Member for Southport, there are two tenants on the board. The Government are determined that the tenants' views will predominate. I remain puzzled by the reluctance of the hon. Member for Hammersmith to give any explanation as to why he wil not accept the views of the city council and the tenants who voted earlier this year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that if the board chooses to use its legal powers to sell off some of the land the Government will break the law to stop it? Will the Minister tell us how he will break the law to stop it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to explain to the hon. Gentleman—he is being very obtuse—that the Government's purpose is to serve the interests of the tenants. That is why, after a substantial majority of tenants voted in favour of a housing action trust, the Government are determined to see the trust succeed. I regret that the Labour party is determined to overthrow the trust, if it gets the opportunity. Tenants will be consulted individually about their wishes. The trust may also find a way to consult them collectively. I can assure the Committee that it is not the Government's intention, or that of the Secretary of State, to give consent to any proposals by the housing action trust that would force tenants, against their wishes, to accept a certain landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To answer the other point raised by the hon. Member for Southport, there are 11 board members. The Chairman is David Liggins and the vice-chairman is the chairman of Hull city council housing committee. There are two tenant members on the board and two other councillors on the board, one whom lives in the area of the housing action trust. The other five members have been nominated by the Secretary of State. The HAT comprises 2,109 council properties and just over 300 owner-occupied properties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should just like to correct the rather lengthy history lesson given to us by the hon. Member for Hammers-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
mith. There have been not seven but three votes on housing action trusts. Two of them rejected trusts and the proposals were not pursued. The third vote, in Hull, was in favour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the areas that opposed trusts in the past now change their minds, the Government are of course ready to listen to any proposals and will happily negotiate. The purpose of the housing action trust policy is to improve conditions for tenants in areas where tenants are facing difficulties that cannot sensibly be handled either by local government, under the estate action programme, or by any other means. The purpose is to improve conditions for tenants. That, no doubt, is why the Labour party is so anxious to get rid of housing action trusts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a very important point. Will the Minister confirm that I can now approach the tenants in all seven areas and tell them that if they contact the Minister, they will get a deal similar to the one in north Hull and that they can have it soon? I should warn the Minister that the cost will be between £350 million and £450 million. Can I have that guarantee, because I am willing to go out now and phone the tenants' organisations and tell them about the Minister's commitment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are used to U-turns by the Labour party but that is more than I expected to achieve in 46 minutes. When the hon. Gentleman came into the Committee he stated his implacable hostility to housing action trusts. It was so great that even where tenants were in favour of them, he was against them. Now, at 11.16 am, he offers to act as an unpaid salesman on behalf of the Government to promote this Conservative policy in Labour areas where previously it has been rejected. I welcome his conversion. His support is sudden. We shall have to see how long it lasts, but it is welcome, nevertheless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I gladly give the commitment. If tenants live in areas of the country where there are severe housing problems that their local authority cannot handle, we shall of course be willing to listen to their proposals. That is already the case. Liverpool has started to go down this road, which we welcome. We are encouraging local authorities to come forward with positive ideas, to which we shall try to respond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may clarify one further point, the Secretary of State's agreement is necessary to the terms of any transfer, even of land, by the housing action trust. It would therefore remain possible for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to reject the terms of the transfer, if we were not satisfied that that transfer was in the interests of the tenants. The whole point that the hon. Gentleman has been labouring for about 20 minutes is based on a complete misunderstanding of the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If our debate this morning is followed by favourable votes in Waltham Forest and if our negotiations in Liverpool come to fruition, the House will have a further opportunity to debate the merits of this Conservative proposal. I look forward to taking part in those debates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The situation is as I described it. I have letters from the Secretary of State confirming that the trusts can sell off if they so wish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the Secretary of State's consent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. It depends on how they do it and whether they transfer tenants with it. That is what matters. The legal problem that the hon. Member for Rossendale and Darwen (Mr. Trippier) had was that he wanted to give that commitment, but it was too late because the Bill had been enacted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been given two important commitments this morning. I welcome them both. First, the Government will change the law as soon as they can. I shall be looking out for that first opportunity. Secondly, they are enabling me, and others, to advise tenants in the seven areas that rejected the HATs. I accept that there is a formal voting system, but the Minister ignores the ballots organised by the tenants themselves. He can do that if he wants, but I take those votes very seriously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about the vote in Hull? Does the hon. Gentleman take that seriously?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I made that clear to Hull. That is why there is no problem between the Hull councillors, my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Mr. McNamara) and me. The position is clear. If the tenants vote for it—great, no problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that mean that the hon. Gentleman will not discontinue the North Hull housing action trust, if he has the chance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it does not mean that. Everyone knows what the Labour party policy has been for some time—it is in writing. The housing action trusts, as originally formulated and as they exist in law now are not a desirable entity. Even the Liberal Democrats voted against the measure, although the hon. Member for Southport (Mr. Fearn) has forgotten that. They will be wound up after full consultation with the tenants and the local authority on how and how quickly it should happen. Tenants will have the right to choose the landlord that they want. That has been our position since 1988.

The second commitment is that the tenants groups in the seven areas that rejected housing action trusts can now come to the Minister and say—the Minister gave this commitment—that they would like a deal similar to the one for Hull, with the same structure and commitments, because even though it is not legally binding it is stronger that the one that they now have. They can say that they want it soon, and the money that goes with it. The Minister says that they can have it. I am

interested to hear that that is so. I shall pass on the information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see that the Minister is trying to intervene. I hope that he will not deny what he has said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course not, but I shall deny what you have just said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I did not say anything.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg your pardon, Mr. Knox. Of course I shall deny what the hon. Gentleman says, because I should welcome approaches from tenants in any area. That is what I said and the record will show it. The Government are happy to enter into negotiations for the establishment of housing action trusts, subject to ballots in those areas. The Government will not impose anything. Unlike the hon. Gentleman's party, the Government will not override the wishes of the tenants. The Committee still awaits an explantion of why, amid promises of future consultation and concern about whether tenants have a right to vote at the end of the housing action trust, the hon Gentleman and his party are so determined to override the wishes expressed by the tenants. We have no explanation of that. If the seven areas come forward with proposals, the Government are ready to listen to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been watered down a bit. I do not blame you for keeping out of it, Mr. Knox.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member has been here long enough to know that the Chairman never gets involved in such arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Quite right, Mr. Knox. I shall watch with interest to see what the Treasury Ministers say about the commitment that the Minister has just given, because it will involve £350 million to £450 million—perhaps more. That is something on which we shall challenge the Minister in due course. On that basis, I am happy to leave the situation where it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
