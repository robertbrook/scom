	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the matter of Local Government Structure and Finance in Scotland—[	<i>Mr. Lang.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise that many hon. Members wish to speak in the debate, so I shall not delay the Committee for long. I just want to finish what I was saying before we were interrupted on Tuesday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the recent changes in further education and schools because, in conjunction with the proposed changes in local government, they mean devolution by bringing power nearer to people and making people at local level more interested and involved in the decisions affecting their community. In support of his demand for regular revaluation, the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) called the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and mentioned an example of three properties in a row. Those of us who remember the horrors of the Labour Government's statutory requirement for revaluation in Scotland, but not in England and Wales, will bear in mind the average length of mortgage and the number of times that people move.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I question not the competence or experience of the chartered surveyors, but their impartiality and I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will bear that in mind. A great weakness of the old rating system was that every time people improved their property, they had to have it revalued for rating. That always struck me as the economics of the madhouse as we want people to look after, improve and extend their properties. The proper time to value the property is when it comes on the market or when the tenants change because the market value will be assessed accurately by what people pay for the property or by what they pay in rent. That is the logical and sensible way to proceed and would take care of the pensioners mentioned by the hon. Member for Garscadden and single people living alone in the family home who would not then be faced with all the horrors of revaluation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome wholeheartedly the proposal for single-tier authorities, but there is a need for strategic planning advice—I emphasise the word advice. That is why I believe that my proposals for a senate are a realistic, viable way forward that would produce no constitutional problems and would not impinge upon the integrity of the union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Members wish to contribute to the debate so they can work out for themselves how long they have to speak. If hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas McAvoy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Rutherglen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take account of what you say about time, Mr. Martin, but I have a case to make and I hope that hon. Members will bear in mind that I do not often take up their time, either on the Floor of the House or in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends have covered the local government finance aspects of the debate well. I concur with everything that they have said about the Government's attitude to local government in Scotland. As a former Strathclyde councillor, I know that Strathclyde and other councils have a difficult task as they strive to maintain services for the people they represent. The Tories are directly responsible for the administrative nightmare, non-collection and general havoc caused by the poll tax and the chaos of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the reservations of some of my hon. Friends about my attitude. I have no illusions about the motivation behind the consultation paper. It aims to downgrade the role of democratically-elected councils. The Tories cannot tolerate dissident voices or the inevitable and essential checks and balances that local government provides against central Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's intention is clear, as is my position. I oppose the review of local government. The Government propose it for the wrong reasons. An independent commission should undertake such a task—or a Scottish Assembly, which a Labour Government would establish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, a Conservative Government currently hold office and, as a constituency Member of Parliament, it is my duty to face reality and get the best deal for my constituents. As a manual worker shop steward for the Amalgamated Engineering Union in the Hoover factory at Cambuslang, it was my job to negotiate with the management on behalf of the union's members. That did not signal approval of the management; my readiness to lobby the Government should not be interpreted as approval of them. I am sure that my hon. Friends who are former manual worker shop stewards will agree with that analogy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case for a local council, which would cover Cambuslang and Rutherglen, has not arisen from the consultation document, but has existed since 1973 when a Conservative Government decided that Cambuslang and Rutherglen should be included in the new Glasgow district council. Both the eighth district council that covered Cambuslang and the town council that covered the royal burgh of Rutherglen lobbied hard for their own district council. It was a travesty of justice that that did not happen. I am happy to acknowledge that some Ministers in the Scottish Office now recognise that a mistake was made in 1973.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that Cambuslang and Rutherglen should form a district council within Strathclyde region. There
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0323">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>41</span>
are some strategic powers over education, transport, social work and regional planning that belong to Strathclyde regional council. Smaller district councils could not run such services. I do not advocate that they should, but it would be wrong for the Government to remove those powers and grant them to unelected, unaccountable quangos.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a late supporter of Scottish devolution, I recognise a gap in the Government's reasoning—their refusal to comtemplate a Scottish Assembly. A Labour Government hopes to establish such an assembly in their first year of office. There is an assumption that the assembly would itself control the current regional council functions. It seems that Strathclyde regional council will go whatever happens and a network of local councils will run district council services. As a former Strathclyde regional councillor, I regret that, because Strathclyde council has a good record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A regional body or a Scottish Assembly should run strategic services, while a local council in Cambuslang and Rutherglen runs district council services. Hon. Members do not always know each other's constituencies well—that is not a criticism. I shall present the case that has existed since 1973 for a Cambuslang and Rutherglen council. Hon. Members will probably ask about viability and I shall make some comparisons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The electorate in Cambuslang and Rutherglen totals 43,000 out of a population of 57,000. Bearsden and Milngavie is smaller, with an electorate of 32,000 and a population of 41,000. Cumbernauld and Kilsyth is slightly larger than my area with an electorate of 46,000 and a population of 63,000. Eastwood has an electorate of 47,000 and a population of 60,250. That, too, is slightly larger than my area, whereas Cumnock and Doon Valley, which is not an urban area, has an electorate of 34,000 and a population of 43,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAvoy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Only briefly, as I do not want to take up hon. Members' time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that land area is as important as population? Cumnock and Doon Valley is a very large, rural area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAvoy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already noted that Cumnock and Doon Valley is a rural constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the councils that I have listed are viable under present funding arrangements. A Cambuslang and Rutherglen council would be similarly funded and similarly viable. We are a mixed community, with a good spread of public and private sector housing, good public parks and reasonable leisure facilities. Rutherglen town council was the first local authority in Scotland to introduce sheltered housing, of which it now has more than any authority of a comparable size. Our community is genuinely whole, and community and social workers all over west Scotland are trying to create the same social mix and cohesion that we enjoy. We have it, but we are losing it because we are part of Glasgow district council, which is too big. It is far
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
bigger than anything that we are used to dealing with. In our smaller set-up, everyone knew the councillors who, by and large, all did a good job—and that includes the Conservative Councillors as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The services run by district councils are too community-based to be run properly by a council such as Glasgow, which has an electorate of 540,000 and a population of 695,000. That is just too big to be able to relate to people. I realise that some hon. Members will have reservations about such sentiments, but the first line of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities' description of the principles of local government states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"local communities have the right to local self-government with a capacity for local choice and local voice".</p></blockquote>
That is exactly the feeling in Cambuslang and Rutherglen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People in my constituency know that the future of Rutherglen town hall is not as important to Glasgow district council as it is locally. They know that proposals to locate a huge landfill site in Halfway to take all Glasgow's refuse is not as big an issue in the giant Glasgow council as it is locally. What is wrong with a sense of community? Politicians are supposed to listen to people. The case for a Rutherglen and Cambuslang council has been recognised by distinguished people who cannot be dismissed as having an axe to grind. The late Tom Fraser who served on the Wheatley commission, revealed that it was agreed not to recommend a Cambuslang and Rutherglen council only on a vote of four to three. He went on record to express his regret about that decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke), a member of the Stodart committee and a former president of COSLA, has also spoken of the justice of our case, and he brings to the debate a reputation for being one of the finest servants of Scottish local government. I am grateful for his support, which has strengthened my conviction that we have a case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall tackle head-on some of the criticism levelled at me on this matter. I am not anti-Glasgow: how could I be, when I have the honour to represent Castlemilk East and Toryglen? The resentment felt by some councillors on Glasgow district council towards a local council for Cambuslang and Rutherglen genuinely baffles me. How can support for one's own community be regarded as being anti-Glasgow? I cannot understand that mentality. The minority of councillors who express that view only perpetuate the image of big brother dominating and bullying its smaller neighbours. I understand that senior Glasgow councillors instructed officials to compile lists of the money spent on Cambuslang and Rutherglen hoping to prove that we received more than our share. If that approach is adopted publicly, it will be the final proof that the big brother attitude prevails in Glasgow city chambers. I hope that those officials will also compile figures for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0324">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>43</span>
rates, rent and poll tax paid by my constituents; they more than pay their way. People must be bereft of pride in their own great city if they cannot abide others having pride in their communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a mandate to speak about Cambuslang and Rutherglen. Thousands of people have moved between the Glasgow part of my constituency and Rutherglen and Cambuslang since reorganisation. Anyone who moves into a community is automatically part of it. People have been moving in and out of Cambuslang and Rutherglen for more than a century and there is no question of resentment or hostility towards members of the communities who have moved in since 1975. I would not tolerate any attempt to create second-class citizens in my constituency. People are people, no matter where they stay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was born and brought up in Rutherglen. When I was a schoolboy, I was told that I was a newcomer because my grandparents had come to Rutherglen only 40 years before I was born. Therefore, I can recognise narrow-minded parochialism, but I will not be associated with it. In Castlemilk East and Toryglen, there is a good case for Glasgow south-east council, based on the south-east area management committee boundaries, which includes Castlemilk West, which is in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow Cathcart (Mr. Maxton). That community should not have been split between two parliamentary constituencies. I do not have a mandate to advocate a local council in that area. I am more honest in acknowledging that than those who advocate proposals for areas in which they have no mandate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Toryglen is an area of Glasgow that is most integrated with Rutherglen. There is massive interchange of people and co-operation between the community councils. People use the same housing department, social work office, library and shopping centre. I do not have a mandate to advocate that Toryglen should become part of a Cambuslang rather than a Toryglen district council, but I will try to ascertain public opinion on that proposal because there is a genuine case for a smaller unit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Toryglen is the area that I first represented as a councillor and I have a special relationship with the people. They are the salt of the earth, the very best of Glasgow working-class people and I am pround and honoured to represent them in Parliament. I have received their warmest personal support and without it I would not be here. I feel at home among those people. If they decide to join a new council, I shall be delighted, but if they do not, I want Toryglen to continue to be part of my parliamentary constituency. There is no reasosn why it should not; other constituencies overlap district council boundaries. I am not pleading a special case because there are other comparisons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case for a local council in Cambuslang and Rutherglen will not go away. I shall organise a campaign in co-operation with community groups to show what people desire and then make a case for local democracy—unanswerable by Labour or Tory Governments—in the Rutherglen and Cambuslang part of my constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
	<p>10.48 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Maclennan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caithness and Sutherland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whatever criticisms are made of the present structure, it should be stated at the outset that the efforts of local councillors in Scotland are not given public acclaim as often as they should be. That goes back a long way. Ayrshire Members, especially, will recall the description by John Galt in his famous novel "The Provost" of the public perception of how local councillors operate in their local area. One episode in the novel relates how Provost Pawkie tried to introduce public lamps in the royal borough of Gudetown. He was opposed in that valuable initiative by three people. One was a Mr. Hickberry of clearly Thatcherite tendencies, who suggested that, rather than public lighting, the inhabitants of Gudetown should be ordered to keep their shutters open at night. The second opponent Mr. Dribbles, the inn keeper, warned the council that folk returning home would not like the profane populace to see them after dark. Mr. Dippings, the candlemaker, felt that public lighting would encourage the commonality to keep late hours and that the gentry would have no need of them because they had glass lanterns with two candles each.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That image of local authorities is too ofen perpetuated. It makes amusing reading, but it does not fairly represent the long hours, expense, travel and personal sacrifice that councillors put into local government. Although Provost Pawkie got no support for his efforts in Gudetown, he would have been pleased about developments in the Highland regional council since reorganisation, as there is now scarcely a township that is not lit by sodium lamps.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government announced their proposal in any detail, and then not very much, only this week, so we cannot give a detailed response to the pale blue paper—it is not a Green Paper—asking for advice on the structure of local government. So my comments will be of a preliminary nature as I and my right hon. and hon. Friends intend to consult widely in local government, particularly with councillors in our constituencies. Even in the short consultation period allowed, I hope that it will be possible to provide answers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today I shall speak of some general principles that the Government have enunciated and others that they should bear in mind in proposing a further reorganisation. Provost Pawkie was operating in a system of local government in Scotland that remained unchanged between 1473 and 1833. Changes have been rather more frequent in the post-war period and such unsettlement carries a cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have asked for comments on how to minimise the disruption. One area for consideration is what to do about capital debts that local authorities have accumulated. Will loan charges be met by 100 per cent funding from the Government? Such detail would more appropriately be left until later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is instructive to go back to the most exhaustive examination of local government in Scotland in modern times. It took place under the Wheatley commission, which looked carefully at the principles that should underline restructuring and asked questions
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0325">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>45</span>
that are as germane and relevant to the debate today as they were then. Furthermore, those questions help us to judge whether the structure that was backed by Parliament has achieved what was hoped of it when it was put forward with broad cross-party support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first principle that Wheatley espoused was that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Local government should he enabled to play a more important, responsible and positive part in the running of the country—to bring the reality of government nearer to the people."</p></blockquote>
It is doubtful that the local government reforms have achieved that principle. However, the reason for that has less to do with the structure of local government than the propensity of central Government, whether Conservative or Labour, to draw more and more power—especially financial power—to the centre.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and Kinross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have been asked to be brief, so I should prefer not to give way, but I shall do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman. When Fife county council became Fife regional council it did not add a hen, chicken or rabbit to its duties. It renamed the local sanitary officer the environmental health officer, and tripled the salary overnight, from £6,000 to £18,000. I was told of those appalling scandals by the Labour regional chairman, Mr. Williams.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not presume to comment on the internal affairs of other local authorities. No doubt the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir N. Fairbairn) will deal with those matters in his own speech if he happens to catch your eye, Mr. Martin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was speaking of the failure of the last reorganisation to enhance the powers of responsible local government. Consideration of new reforms ought to go beyond structure. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood). He reminded the Committee the other day of the attitude of the late John Mackintosh who, in a powerful series of articles and speeches, drew attention to the folly of considering reform of finance, structure and function separately. The Government seem to be institutionalising that disjunction in a way that makes a coherent debate on the future of local government almost impossible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wheatley's second objective of reorganisation was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Local government should be equipped to provide services in the most satisfactory manner, particularly from the point of view of the people receiving the services."</p></blockquote>
My experience of the highland region has given me a sense that the structure of local government there has not impeded the provision of good and valuable personal services. Where there are shortcomings, local authorities are able to recognise them and set them right, although it is not always certain that they have the resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wheatley's third objective was the enhancement of local democracy, which
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"should constitute a system in which power is exercised through the elected representatives of the people, and in which those representatives are locally accountable for its exercise."</p></blockquote>
That has perhaps turned out to be the area of greatest weakness, certainly in the highlands. For that reason alone, reorganisation would be justified. Wheatley called for a change that would ensure that councillors should not be trammelled by being accountable to some other body than the electors. However, in the exercise of their functions, councillors are hamstrung by central government, to whom they are accountable for almost everything that they do. Their scope for decision-making has been systematically whittled away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wheatley also noted that local authority members must be able to exercise their power and responsibility without practical hindrance. In some areas of Scotland, distance is a severe practical hindrance to the proper exercise of power and responsibility. In my constituency, regional councillors have to make round trips of 260 miles to attend regional council committee meetings. That is a practical impediment to effective service.

The Wheatley commission was exercised about the need to have a wide range of candidates at the elections. It is striking how many council seats, particularly in highland region, have not been contested in local elections. We must assume that that is because of the difficulty of service in the regional councils that afflicts those without independent means or those who are not self-employed. That serious problem has resulted in a narrowing of the democratic base and must be kept in mind in determining the geographical extent of the proposed unitary authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wheatley warned of such danger and spoke also of avoiding
	<br><blockquote><p>"emptying "local" of all its content, with the result that too many decisions are taken on a plain which to the man in the street seems just as rarefied and inaccessible as St. Andrew's House or Whitehall."</p></blockquote>
That fear has been justified and confusion remains in planning about who is responsible for what. Many decisions are actually made at St. Andrew's House or Whitehall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have preferred the paper to contain a more strongly-argued case for strengthening democracy in local government in Scotland. That would include widening local government's competence by statute to enable it to fulfil locally perceived needs according to financial capacity and not, as has happened, a progressive restriction on local government that excludes it from more functions by transferring them to unaccountable bodies, such as housing associations and St. Andrew's House, and to non-appointed bodies, such as the local enterprise companies which are responsible for promoting local development. In their paper—a pale blue paper—the Government speak of the importance of forging links between those bodies. That is true, but the need to strengthen local government is scarcely recognised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How effective has local government been since 1973? I find that difficult to judge for Scotland, but there has been a debit side and a credit side in my
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0326">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
constituency. Major capital works, which have been embarked on and completed, have been beneficial to the community. They include building Kylescu bridge in west Sutherland, the money that the roads and transport committee put into the development of the ports of Kinlochbervie and Lochinver and many good works in social service provision. However, ultimately the restructuring of local government, which took place then, has not proved beneficial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are great gaps in the provision of the roads network in my constituency. The regional council had to stand on the sidelines and call on the Government—so far with virtually no response—to bring up to a proper modern standard the main arterial road, the A9, which runs north to John O'Groats. Local government has not succeeded in making effective that basic infrastructure requirement. However, other road problems are more directly within its power to tackle, following the Government's decision to end the Crofter counties road scheme: for example, the A836 along the north coast of Scotland and the A838 from Durness, Laxford Bridge to Lairg. Those roads have barely improved beyond a medieval condition, although they carry millions of pounds worth of fish from the port of Kinlochbervie to the south. Lorries hurtle down the roads—they have no choice. They are a threat to safety. It is more difficult to gain access to the market and the region has been able to do nothing about it. The reform of local government cannot worsen that specific predicament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other examples of confusion, such as the proposed redevelopment of Pulteneytown in Wick. That was first mooted in 1970 by the royal burgh council and was subsequently tossed back and forth between the Highland regional council and Caithness district council. It was left to the Scottish Development Agency and then returned to the Highlands and Islands Development Board, which doubted that it had funds to carry out such environmental improvements. The reorganised local government has failed to make an appreciable impact on a long-standing problem of modernisation and environmental renewal in the former county town of Caithness in 20 years. That is an indictment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most schools in my constituency were built before local government reform occurred. One project, to build a school on the west coast of Sutherland, was approved by the late Frank McElhone when he was Under-Secretary of State for Scotland in the last Labour Government in 1979. That project has never been funded. It still cries out for funds. It does not receive the priority that it deserves under existing local government structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those examples show the need for change. I can give another instance of post-Stodart tinkering. The responsibility for leisure and recreation in the highland region has been transferred to the district council. Consequently, the proposal for the construction of a swimming pool in Wick was snatched away. It has not been built, although the local authority intends to go
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
ahead. It is a hugely expensive project, which will drain the limited resources of a lower-tier authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have given illustrations of a situation that is not ideal. However, when the Secretary of State considers the principles for reform, I hope that he will examine the cases for a fairer system of election. In some parts of Scotland—I do not refer to the Highland regional council, where the problems are different—minorities within communities are not effectively represented. All sections are not necessarily represented by the first-past-the-post system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When he opened the debate on Tuesday, the Secretary of State for Scotland told the Committee that he was in the business of debunking myths and setting the record straight on the Government's approach to local government. He boasted about record increases in local government services during the past three Parliaments and about increases in education provision. He said that more students now stay on at school and enter higher education than ever before. He boasted that there were 1,700 additional social workers and that 22,000 more Scots received assistance. He said, too, that there were more than 1,000 additional policemen. To be fair, he was more cautious in describing other Government achievements. The poll tax was passed over very quickly, in a sentence of just seven words. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have made changes to local taxation."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> Scottish Grand Committee, 18 June 1991, c.1.]</p></blockquote>
You bet they have made changes to local taxation!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can understand the Secretary of State's reluctance to dwell on the poll tax. Rarely has so much unnecessary suffering been inflicted on so many Scots by so few political fanatics, at least three of whom still occupy the Government Front Bench. I exempt the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) from the allegation of being a fanatic. He strikes me as a honest man who fell among thieves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State was wise to move quickly from the poll tax to what the next day's press said was a spirited performance. He tried to convince the Committee that the growth in local government services was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0327">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>49</span>
directly attributable to the Scottish arm of the Tory Government. They encouraged the councils to provide more, they persuaded the councils to take on more police and employ more home helps and social workers. They paid the bill and met the additional costs that arose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State boasted that the Government provided £2.8 billion in revenue support grant for the current year. The Committee was expected to believe that that set the record straight and debunked the myths. That was in the early part of the Secretary of State's speech. Those who were able to stay awake during the rest of the so-called spirited performance detected a different tone as his speech wore remorselessly on. Suddenly, we heard that the local government spending programmes were;
	<br><blockquote><p>"the height of irresponsibility".—[	<i>Official Report,</i> Scottish Grand Committee, 18 June 1991, c.9.]</p></blockquote>
and that they lacked self control. So irresponsible were Scottish local councils that the Secretary of State was required to take on more draconian capping powers to protect local taxpayers. Without those powers, how could the Secretary of State prevent local councils spending money on social workers, additional policeman and improving the education service?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I am the suspicious type, but I detect an internal contradiction in the Secretary of State's spirited performance. It is illogical to claim credit for spending programmes that expand services while describing them as "highly irresponsible" and justifying Government intervention to crush local democracy in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believed that Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde were two aspects of the same fictional character in the Robert Louis Stevenson novel, but they are alive and well and made manifest in the Secretary of State's spirited performance last Tuesday. He is Dr. Jekyll when he is wallowing in the glow that comes with the increase in local government services but Mr. Hyde when he is stamping on spending programmes that pay for the same expansion of local government services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key consideration for the Committee is the relationship between central and local government in Scotland and the proper balance of power between them. The Secretary of State would have us believe that the Government are not a centralising Government but are keen to encourage a pluralistic approach to government in Scotland. The facts do not support his arguments. The facts put the Government right in the frame over the centralising of power, responsibility and influence here in undemocratic Westminster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Competitive tendering ensures that the Secretary of State will decide the basis on which local government contracts are awarded to those who tender. The opting-out of schools is designed to move schools out of local government control and bring them under the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>50</span>
wing and influence of the Secretary of State for Scotland. Scottish Homes and Scottish Enterprise are designed to weaken local government influence and increase the influence of their political masters in such important areas as education, training, housing and economic development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State can cap local government expenditure. He can abolish or cut housing support grant and Revenue support grant and limit the amount of money that local councils can borrow. The Government are the most centralising Government in the entire post-war era of Scottish political history, mainly—but not always—by deliberate intent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sometimes the Government centralises when they do not need to do so. We were told that the poll tax was introduced to make councils directly accountable to the local electorate. We now know that it did not work out as it was intended. When the poll tax was scrapped, so was any semblance of electoral accountability. So the Government achieved the very opposite of what they intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current make up of the Government was established by an internal Cabinet coup last November in a blind electoral panic. One of the first actions of that Government was to transfer £4.25 billion from local to central control across the whole United Kingdom. The situation was best summed up in an editorial on 22 March in the 	<i>Financial Times,</i> which normally does not support the Labour party. It said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A tier of Government dependent on central Government for almost 90 per cent of its resources and controlled not only in its overall spending but in the detail of much of what it delivers, barely deserves the name of Government."</p></blockquote>
That is the sorry state to which the Government have delivered local government in Scotland, England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By their record, the Government have demonstrated that they neither understand nor care about local government and local democracy. They do not deserve to have charge of local government reform in Scotland. They have no democratic right to implement local government reform. They are simply the discredited Scottish rump of a disintegrating Tory Government who will not last much longer than next year. The people of Scotland never voted for them, and never will. Scotland does not want the consultation paper or their half-baked and half-crazed ideology. In a few months' time, Scotland will play its part in ensuring that the Government are consigned to the dustbin of history. The Scots will then place local government reform in the hands of those, and only those, who have any right to implement local government reform in Scotland—the members of a directly elected Scottish Parliament that will be created by the incoming Labour Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Wheatley commission's report began with the sentence:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Something is seriously wrong with local government in Scotland."</p></blockquote>
Local government in Scotland took on its present form only in May 1975–16 years ago. In the context of the history Of Scottish local government there has not been much time for the House to make a considered judgment on how well it is doing, but I shall come to that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Seldom in the history of local government have local councillors, council officials and others who seek to serve local communities been asked to do their job and at the same time been presented with so many difficulties by central Government. The Secretary of State should have been a great deal more modest when he presented his paper the other day. He ignored the claim that an independent commission would be an appropriate way to review the new format.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most difficult task faced by local councils was the implementation of the community charge. Those words have not passed the lips of Conservative Members. Local authorities had to deal with that problem in addition to the structural changes that took place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before they deal with the council tax, the Government must take certain steps immediately. By far the most important is the abolition of the 20 per cent rule. It is not surprising that the Government have admitted that that should be abolished, because even the poorest have to pay. It and other aspects of the tax have created an administrative nightmare. If the rule is wrong in 1993, it is wrong now. I am disappointed that the Secretary of State missed the opportunity to act on the overwhelming evidence that it should go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have presented five principles on local government finance. I shall deal briefly with them before I discuss proposals for the format. The Government have said that they are committed to accountability, fairness, ease of collection, equitable distribution of the burden and restraint. If this exercise were primary testing, the Government would not be doing very well. I would give them one out of five, although they have achieved restraint if restraint is a euphemism for capping. The evidence of their failure in accountability and fairness is the restricted amount of local revenue that local authorities are able to collect—only 14 per cent compared to 42 per cent in 1988–89. The Government are deliberately attempting to reduce the role of local government in communites. That policy is not generally supported. The Society of Local Authority Chief Executives said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are strongly of the view that such a low percentage of local government funding derived locally will reduce rather than enhance local accountability."</p></blockquote>
If the debate is about accountability and ease of collection, the Government have failed miserably. They have failed in terms of local government finance and have added to the problems of local councils of all political complexions. Poverty has increased as a result of Government policy and local councils are being prevented from dealing with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government propose a new structure for local government in their consultation paper. Power has
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>52</span>
been eroded and the Government wish that to continue. At the beginning of the document, the Government refer not to the 14th century but to the 12th century and imply that local government has no power except that given to it by the Executive—this House. That may be true, but is is not a good way of achieving local authority co-operation in giving local government a fresh structure. The Government seem to be saying that compulsory competitive tendering should be instituted whether local authorities like it or not, on the grounds that is saves money. What it does to services or staffing levels appears not to matter one iota. Power continues to move to St. Andrew's house and, by implication, to Whitehall and the Treasury. The Secretary of State said on 23 April:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We intend to consult widely on the structure of local government because we intend to get it right."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 23 April 1991; Vol. 189, c.938.]</p></blockquote>
That would be a start. It is reasonable to try to get it right, if only because COSLA has estimated that the changes would cost in the region of £150 million. Why then does the Secretary of State for Scotland, in contrast to the Secretary of State for the Environment, steadfastly refuse to accept the overwhelming support that exists for a commission to examine these matters? A Government whose policies are regarded universally as anti-local government are not best equipped to carry out a reform of the structure of local government that we are told will take us into the next century. The Government do not have the confidence of local councillors, regardless of their political views. How could they, when they siezed on the Widdicombe report to introduce restrictions that I consider to be obscene? The Government introduced cash limits on councillors' allowances that, had they been applied to Members of Parliament, would have been regarded as absurd. In Strathkelvin, the limit is £2,290. That is in total contrast to the Wheatley report's major contention that the elected councillor is the key person in local government. That has not been true since this Government have been in power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have taken refuge behind the Wheatley report, the Stodart committee and the Montgomery report. I was delighted with the speech made by my hon. Friend the Member for Rutherglen, because the Stodart committee, of which I was a member, received compelling evidence from the district councils of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee in favour of single city status. We also received evidence of the professionalism of Strathclyde region, where there was much more investment in education in the inner city. The hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie) is not in the Room, but we received evidence of investment in Argyll's infrastructure—in social work, roads, and lighting—which had not been a priority under the previous Argyll county council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be an enormous mistake for the Government to disregard the experience and commitment of those who serve local government so well. To compare the new structure with local enterprise councils and even with health authorities is no way to approach local government in the modern age, because those are highly unrepresentative bodies. The roles of local government, elected councillors and the people who
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0329">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>53</span>
make up the communities that they serve have been ignored almost completely. That principle was never accepted in any Act of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government want local authorities to take on an enabling role. They are not to be providers at all. That is a distinct change in Government thinking, and reflects what has happened in social work following the Griffiths report. Local councils have enormous experience, but are now expected to contribute to the increase in the numbers of private residential homes and the wider spread of voucher systems and the like. Moreover, as the health service is reduced and private residential homes proliferate, we shall find that the most difficult cases, such as folk who are doubly incontinent, for example, will be the responsibility of the local councillors, who have been told that they are the enablers and should deal with the problem. The providers, presumably, deal with the most profitable aspects of local services. Obviously, I am keen to go on at greater length. However, some of my hon. Friends wish to speak, so I shall conclude with a couple of general points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that the Government have taken on board the value of the present structure of local government in Europe. So far, Strathclyde has received £300 million from the EEC. When the new local authorities are formed, will they be sufficiently big or well informed? I accept that there is massive support for single-tier local government, which I welcome. However, I am surprised that the Government have such a limited view of the role of local authorities in Scotland and more generally in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government persist in their view that the Secretary of State should decide the future of local government. However, the Secretary of State said to me the other day in the House that he does not expect any changes until 1996. Why the rush? Why does he not properly go back on what he said, and listen to people such as consumers, who have important views on those matters? I plead with the Secretary of State, in his absence, quietly to contemplate the contribution that many outstanding people have made to local government in Scotland. They include Geoffrey Shaw, John Niven in Dumfries and Galloway, Dick Stewart, John Chrighton, Edwin Eunson, Burt Gough and many others. They are serving local government magnificently. If the Secretary of State insists that their voice, like the community's should remain unheard, the Scottish people will decide that a Scottish Parliament in the United Kingdom is crucial to any debate on the future of local government in our country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local government is an important provider of everyday services, and it affects every man, woman and child in Scotland. It is an important part of our democratic system, and it should be recognised as such. Local government genuinely allows people to participate locally in decisions that affect their daily lives. It is a great pity that the true worth and importance of local government have not been given due recognition by
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>54</span>
the Government. They have come the playthings of the Government, to be changed, chopped, rearranged and revoked on the whim of transient Ministers. I can see no other logic in the Government's exercise of parliamentary sovereignty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have much to answer for in their conduct of local government. The Government—past and present Ministers—and civil servants simply got it wrong. They made an absolute disaster of the poll tax, and they are rushing on with yet another shaky, bureaucracy-ridden attempt at finance. A mere 16 or 18 years after the previous complete upheaval of local government structure, the Government are producing this effort, which makes another alteration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government got the poll tax wrong, and they are getting finance wrong, as we see in Stodart and Montgomery. They also got the structure of local government wrong. Their record over previous decades is not good. The proposal is bitty and partial. The Government have a contemptuous attitude towards the finance, structure and status of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Beyond that, management and organisation will trundle along somewhere in the future behind all these changes and all these consultations."</p></blockquote>
The entire procedure is wrongly ordered and prioritised. Surely any review of local government finance can logically flow only from a review of structures and functions. Instead, things are happening the wrong way around and are coming along in bits and pieces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If any group of people has a right to feel extremely angry and hard done to by central Government, it is councillors and officials of local government in Scotland. They have been consistently undermined, downgraded and given the absolute run-around by central Government. Those local authorities have been hit by an unworkable, unfair and useless poll tax. There have been constant changes in the structure and powers given to them. Wave after wave of legislation and new responsibilities have been imposed on them by central Government. At the same time, they have been consistently underfunded for the tasks placed on their shoulders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Central Government have a lot to answer for over their treatment of local authorities. Yet this partial and wrongly ordered exercise plainly demonstrates that Ministers have learnt absolutely nothing from their past conduct and mistakes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local government should be examined as an integrated, complete system; the process should not be a series of separate, rushed issues. What should the role and functions of local government be? What structures, with the related democratic and management objectives that should accompany them, are needed to achieve the aims? Once those questions are answered, it is relatively easy to produce a financial system to achieve those goals and aims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By examining finance before structure and keeping management and organisation as a later and separate afterthought, the Government have revealed their contempt of local government and incompetence in approaching the problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0330">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>55</span>
The Government say that they want accountability, but they know very little about accountability. They have not even thought about it for themselves. The Scottish Office is not accountable through a Scottish Select Committee, even though such a Committee is part of the Standing Orders of this place. There is no accountability to the people about the timing of general elections, which is decided merely on the whim of a Prime Minister, when he thinks that he can scrape through and win. It has nothing to do with accountability or the people's wish for such a test at the hustings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers do not live and work locally. They are not just down the road, but 500 miles away from the people whose lives are affected by their decisions. Ministers rarely have contact with the consumers whom they apparently wish to help, whether in health or education. In those matters, local government councillors and officials are accountable, but Ministers are not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it is ironic that the Government are undermining the reality of such local government accountability that exists. They are proposing a financial system that puts the balance of income at 86 per cent from central Government and only 14 per cent from local sources. that can only reduce local accountability. The high gearing effect of 7: 1, the distribution formula unrelated to actual local needs, constant centralisation of control through legislation and massive capping powers are all Government policy and all act very much against local accountability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the proposed system, underfunding of inflation by central Government will result in huge increases in the amounts that must be raised locally. For example, methods of calculating loan charges can be severely out of step with what is happening locally and with local borrowing costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The personal element of the new council tax looks like producing exactly the same administrative nightmare and problems as those of the absolutely discredited poll tax, but the Government are progressing with all those matters as though they have never learnt anything from their past actions. We are again witnessing yet another missed opportunity. In the interests of fairness, 100 per cent rebates should be applied now to prevent massive and uncollectable debts from being passed on to the new system. Authorities should be given power to write off debts in cases of poverty. The Government provided billions of pounds to write off the debts of English water authorities and they should provide a similar green dowry for the infrastructure debts of Scottish water and sewerage authorities. That would give the new system a clean start and allow it to perform well for the Scottish people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Writing off the capital debts of Scottish housing authorities would transform Scottish housing provision. Instead of 75p of every Glasgow tenants's pound being used to pay interest, it could be directed towards the provision of services and curing the endemic housing problems in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear from Government statements that they will continue to erode and devalue Scottish local government. The phrases used in the document are a give-away—for example;
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>56</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"This exercise will involve initial disruption and transitional costs",</p></blockquote>
It also says that there are
	<br><blockquote><p>"Alternative ways of delivering services",</p></blockquote>
and that there will be an
	<br><blockquote><p>"Extension of the enabling role".</p></blockquote>
If all that is allied to the transfer of further education to the school boards, it adds up to the dismantling of local government services. It is not good enough for local government to be treated in that way. The Government see local government as enablers, not service providers. My view is more positive and is based on my experience of local government and those who work in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Nationalist party has long advocated a single-door approach with single tier, all-purpose local authorities elected by a fair electoral system as the only means of guaranteeing local accountability. I am worried about the Government's attitude to local government and the process that we are entering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If an independent commission is set up for England, there is no good reason why one should not be set up for Scotland. The changes must be right and follow genuine and thorough consultation with the Scottish people. There has been a failure in the past to recognise the true worth and importance of local government and that must not be allowed to continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) referred earlier to the success of Strathclyde regional council in its representations on behalf of Strathclyde. I hesitate to offend the sensibilities of some Conservative Members, but I can think of no other word to describe the land mass that lies between the Atlantic and the western frontiers of Asia. Almost every European country now has a regional system of government and increasingly the regions deal directly with the EC. Eligible Scottish regions—for example, Strathclyde—have been successful in negotiating EC funds for their economic development. There may be problems for smaller authorities, which may not be able to achieve that, but the Government have said nothing about how to overcome the problems that will arise if Strathclyde regional council no longer represents its area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must be recognised that accountability and active participation is more difficult in very large authorities, which have great difficulties in carrying out their duties, especially under the present system. During the years that regional government has existed, central Government have never considered those problems and the present review does not refer to ways of overcoming the difficulties.

Many councils have involved local community councils in area committees to allow people to have a greater say. Again, it is not clear whether the Government intend that to continue and to provide the appropriate resources. However, it is clear that when the Government created the joint boards in England, following the abolition of the Greater London council and the metropolitan counties, they cast aside local community involvement in decision-making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If local government is to be reduced to a committee that sits once a year to decide which firms are to be given contracts, the size of a local authority hardly matters. If that is what is in the Government's mind, they should come clean and say so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Single tiers are preferable on grounds of clarity and accountability. However, it will be difficult to decide upon the optimum size for such single-tier authorities. It is such problems that have made the Government decide to have an independent commission for England. But, having listened to such speeches as those made on Monday, we learned to our surprise that that decision was taken because things are much more complicated in England, and it is a bigger country. In other words, Scotland is too wee and does not need an independent commission, which is absolute nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know what the Government really fear. It is what an independent commission would say. On Monday, I asked what would happen during the Government's consultation exercise if a majority of those being consulted were against compulsory competitive tendering, and whether, in the those circumstances, the Government would drop all such requirements from current legislation. The answer I received from the Secretary of State was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We intend to weigh the submissions and not just count them."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 17 June 1991; Vol. 193, c. 40.]</p></blockquote>
Therefore we know already what the consultation exercise will be worth. That answer will probably apply also to any issue where the Government receive a majority decision that they do not like.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State gave a list of the people he intended to consult. He said that he would consult Scottish Members of Parliament, and so we know in advance that only 10 Members of Parliament will be for his proposals, and a large majority will be against. Therefore, those 10 Members of Parliament will outweigh the other 62. It is also clear that in COSLA, which has hardly any Tory members, the minority views of those few Tory members who are struggling to survive in areas such as Glasgow and Strathclyde will probably outweigh all others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State said that trade unions would be consulted, but there are fewer Tory trade union representatives than there were 12 years ago because of the way in which the Government have knocked the trade unions about. The Secretary of State also mentioned churches, but they have been highly critical of the Government's social policies and, again, the Government cannot expect much support from them. The Government cannot even expect support from industrial and commercial bodies, unless they are involved in cleansing, parks, bowling greens and other such contracts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>58</span>
The Government claim that they intend to revitalise local government. If they really meant that, they would ensure a proper return to local government and not a system where its powers are so curtailed, and its members so underpaid that it becomes difficult to attract and to keep committed and experienced members. The Government's paper said that the management of local government is an increasingly complex task. Yet, nowhere do the Government say how they will help elected members to cope with that complex task in terms of reasonable pay for their efforts or give them unpaid leave from their places of work. If the Government were serious about revitalising local government, they would ask those consulted for their views on how to redress the under-representation of women, and the ethnic minorities in local government. The Government do not even ask the question, "What keeps women out of local government?" Sometimes selection committees are prejudiced against women and ask them questions that they would not ask male candidates, such as, "Who will look after the children when you are at the council? The Government should consider the problems of family responsibilities for which no allowances are made. The Government should also look at the problem of the many members who—if they are employed—are in low-paid occupations and can ill-afford to take unpaid leave to carry out their responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sheer pressure of having to juggle the needs of family, a job and council responsibilities puts an immense burden on people with young children, but at no time in their history has this been dealt with. If we are seriously considering the revitalising of local government, surely now is the time to grasp that nettle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It must be admitted that the Secretary of State was the first Minister in a Tory Government to recognise the need for equality of women's representation in quangos. He accepted a small amendment on the reform of legislation—not having thought about it until now—on Scottish enterprise. Remembering that, I hope that he will at least admit this error and respond to our request. Having heard the hear, hears and seen the nods of hon. Members around me, I know that we share the heartfelt plea that this matter be considered, so I hope that the Minister will take this on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Issues such as this are being considered by the Scottish Constitutional Convention. The cost of measures for increasing women's participation and for running the Scottish Parliament in a manner befitting the 21st century are being taken into account. The Convention has given a unanimous welcome to the proposals. In fairness, I note also that members of the SNP approved of the ideas, although they did not wish to participate in the convention. I wish that they would change their minds and join this realistic fight for true Scottish representation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document published by the Government shows that they are so far from recognising the problem that they do not ask questions on it. The Government do not appear to be genuinely interested in a careful assessment of the answer to questions that their document raises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0332">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>59</span>
The document puts seven points for consideration. The Government ask people to respond to proposals to minimise the costs and the disruption of the forum and ask on what principles people think a system should be based. These complex questions demand much thought, and careful answers. The document does not even include the questions that we have debated. If the Government were serious and wanted people's responses, they would agree to an independent commission being set up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government do not intend to implement any of these ideas until 1993 so, in reality, none of it will happen—that it is as much a fairy tale as anything that Hans Christian Andersen dreamt up. After the general election, there will be a Scottish Parliament that really will reform Scottish local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike Watson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government's consultation paper on the structure of local government is a flimsy document of nine pages, which fails to make a case for a move towards a unitary system of local authorities in Scotland. I favour such a system but only in the context of a Scottish Parliament, which Scottish Office Ministers and the Government reject. Without that fundamental shift of power from Westminster to the people of Scotland, there is no case for dismantling the present system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) has outlined eloquently, as always, the reasons why the Scottish regions have performed a useful role for the past 16 years. Within the present system, if there is no change in terms of the government of Scotland as a whole, there is no case for a change in local authority government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Scottish Parliament would introduce strategic planning in such important areas as education and training, housing and transport, and a change in the role of local authorities would be appropriate in that context. There is no case for the three tiers of local government in Scotland that there would be without a change in the structure of local authorities following the establishment Of a Scottish Parliament. When a Scottish Parliament is created, the return of education to small local authorities would be unwise and, I believe, damaging.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Society of Local Authority Chief Executives advocates strongly the retention of the strategic planning role which Scottish local authorities have had since the creation of the regions in the mid-1970s. Strathclyde region has its critics, mainly on the ground of size. In some respects, I am one of those critics. However, there can be no denying that obvious economies of scale have been made. Strathclyde has been successful, especially in pitching its weight at the European level, which could not have been achieved by a smaller local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are moving towards a Europe of regions. A clear regional identity must be maintained. When a Scottish Parliament is established, it will have a national identity within the United Kingdom and a vital direct role in dealing with Europe. That will not happen if, heaven forbid, the Tories achieve victory at the next general
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>60</span>
election. An absence of regions and clout at the European level to make an impression as Strathclyde would be damaging to Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only Strathclyde, but Tayside, Lothian and Central are looking forward to a more direct role in Europe, yet none of those authorities could survive the Secretary of State's review of local authority structure, and the ability to compete at Euorpean level would disappear. That is why we must be clear about what lies behind the Secretary of State's review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the consultation paper, the Secretary of State claims that the proposals are about accountability and improved delivery of services. I should be glad to examine whether that is correct, because evidence suggests otherwise. After 16 years, some people admittedly remain confused about which services are provided by the districts and which are provided by the regions. To some extent, that clouds accountability, yet it has been over-emphasised, and the problem is not as serious as the Government suggests. There are not many areas in Scotland where district and regional councils are under different political control, especially in the central belt. I am not saying that it does not matter whether people know which council is responsible for services, but it is not a serious problem because people are aware of duality in terms of political control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty in assigning accountability has far more to do with local authorities being blamed for poor or reduced services. The blame lies in fact, fairly and squarely at the Government's door. That is the real accountability problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At my constituency surgeries, I hear many complaints about the council not providing my constituents with a different council house, about the council changing bus routes, or reducing home helps. I have to explain that local authorities are doing the best that they can with the reduced and decreasing resources being made available by the Government. Most of the problems lie with the Government, and that is the important accountability issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities have had their hands tied tighter and tighter by a Government who are determined to centralise authority and control as much as possible. If the Secretary of State is genuinely worried about accountability, why has the relationship between central and local government been shifted further in favour of Westminster by council tax proposals, which mean that only 14 per cent. of local government finance is to be raised locally? My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) has already made that important point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact remains that there is a narrowing tax base over which the Government are exercising a tighter grip. The relationship between central and local government is also narrowing. It is narrow in that little expenditure comes from money that is collected locally as compared with what is taken centrally, partly through value added tax, which is a regressive form of taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should be held responsible for starving local authorities of resources and for the inevitable effect that has on the level of services. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0333">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>61</span>
Government's talk about accountability has a hollow ring at best, and, at worst, it smacks of sheer hypocrisy. To whom are the Secretary of State and his team really accountable in Scotland? There is no real accountability, as the Government were elected in Scotland on only 24 per cent. of the vote. However, they have foistered on the Scottish people policies - from the poll tax, school boards and bus deregulation to primary school testing - that they have never wanted and never voted for. Where is the accountability to the people of Scotland? I challenge the Minister to answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the Minister sheds crocodile tears - as I suspect that he will - for local authority accountability in Scotland, he should give a thought to his own role and that of his colleagues in the Scottish Office in denying accountability through a national Government of Scotland. It is that accountability which concerns Scottish people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that a hidden agenda is behind the document that was issued on Monday and that the plan is to get rid of regional councils in Scotland. This is mainly because the majority - certainly the larger ones - are Labour controlled, and they are thorns in Secretary of State's side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that the Government have said, and I accept, that the plan is not necessarily to get rid of all regional councils. It is the Labour party's position, post-Scottish Parliament, that there should not necessarily be one form of local Government - that it may be appropriate to keep regions here, island councils there and district councils elesewhere. I accept also that a strain of that runs through Government thinking. However, remembering how the Government abolished English metropolitan authorities because they were a thorn in their side and because they regularly returned large Labour majorities, I believe that the same impetus is behind Scottish Office Ministers, in their thinking on the larger Scottish regions, at least.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After a Government review of Scottish local government, the only Labour-controlled regional council that would survive, or could logically survive, would be Fife. It is the only one which could have a place in unitary system. This illustrates that there is a hidden agenda and I challenge the Minister to deny it. It should be exposed because it is not about improving council services or about increasing accountability; it is about increasing Government control and denying Scottish people services that they want and consistently hope for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without a Scottish Parliament, there is no case for unitary authorities. The people of Scotland realise increasingly that local government will come after the election of local government and through a Scottish Parliament and that will be widely welcomed throughout Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

or to understand, or give credance to, the importance of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People often forget the importance of local government. I speak with feeling as someone who for nine years was a member of the old Aberdeen town council. During that time, I was fortunate enough to be the convenor of the health and welfare committee and, latterly, of the social work committee, during which time the new social work department was set up following the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968. It was an exciting time to be in local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that nostalgia often leaves one with a rosy picture of past times. So I say at once that there never was, in my time or at any other, a golden age in local government when there was plenty of money to so whatsoever was wanted without fear of running foul of either electors or the Government for exceeding spending guidelines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we did have was considerable flexibility and opportunity to innovate. There was tremendous innovation in education, in health and welfare and in homes for the elderly, including the development of sheltered housing complexes. All those were available to us because we had sufficient power and responsibility to do what we wanted to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should put on record a tribute not to those of my generation, but to the councillors of the past 12 years who have lived with local government that was faced with sustained hostility and financial constraints. Many of them have managed to keep the vision and commitment going when others would have given up, thinking that it was not worth while.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Councillors do not only get complaints about local authority services. Many councils have faced, and accepted, the anger of Scottish people about the poll tax. Local councillors receive stick for that. The Government should be ashamed about the nonsense that is spoken about abolishing the poll tax. In Grampian region this year the headline poll tax is less than last year, but many of my constituents who receive rebates are paying more because the Government have not properly recalculated the rebate. The £140 reduction that everyone is susposed to recieve is nothing more that a cruel hoax on my constituents and the Scottish people. The Government must bear in mind that only those who are well enough off to pay the full poll tax have recieved the full £140. If the Government do nothing else betwen now and the eventual introduction of the new council tax, I hope that they will get rid of the 20 per cent. rule. That would do more for my constituents than anything else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local government structure and finance is to be examined. I have recieved representations, as I am sure that we all have, from my local authorities. The chief executive of Grampian regional council has no axe to grind and will be retiring soon. I want to put on record my appreciation of Mr MacNaughton's service to local government in Grampian region. He has told me of his grave disquiet about the timetable for introducing the new council tax. He says that it will cause chaos because it will be impossible to introduce the new tax in time. The Government must reconsider the matter.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have not properly considered the rights and duties that go with responsibility in local government and the way in which responsibility goes with rights and duties. There is a balance. Local councils cannot be described as irresponsible if they are not given a real job to do. If the review was merely a technical exercise concerning difficulties in a system that had existed for 15 or 16 years—for example, difficulties with some of the overlapping responsibilities, or boundaries that are not exactly right and need minor readjustments—no one would object to proceeding with consultation without an independent commission. However, that is not so. This is a fundamental review of structure. I am realistic about a genuine dilemma with the marriage of regional authorities and district councils. Some Tories are nostalgic for the old county councils, but my recollection is that they were never the agents or machines of radical change, nor were they enthusiastic purveyors of services. They were not too bad on roads, which allowed farmers to get around nicely. Yet they were mainly concerned with keeping rates down to protect the people who elected them. I have no truck with the idea that the old county councils should be remembered with fondness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was an opponent of regional councils. I can sometimes be described as an Aberdeen nationalist - [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I always wanted to see Aberdeen town council retain its unitary functions. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Let us have none of these asides. I should not go into local grief. I wanted to retain unitary authorities, but I concede that regional councils have made some improvements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not go into the new developments with the general hostility to local government that is displayed by Conservative Members. Nor should we be hostile to the regional council system without proper consideration of its merits. If we do not avoid both of those attitudes, the review will fail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general planning, economic development and transport policy, the regions have beneficially adopted a wider role. In some cases, the district council can be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>64</span>
too small to work in all those policy areas. We have faced up to that in the past. In the Grampian area, which we used to call the north-east of Scotland, we tried to bring the different authorities—Aberdeen town council, the county councils and others—together to examine economic development. That is how NESDA—the north-east of Scotland development association—arose as a voluntary joint board. It did not really work, but that was not because people did not try. It is simply that joint boards do not work. Joint responsibility on a voluntary basis does not work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must have a proper examination and discussion of how the new system will work. We have had 16 years already. In a sense, it has shaken down better than many people anticipated. Some people are more enthusiastic about regional councils than others. We must consider the size of the new unitary authorities. They must be large enough to deal with planning, to raise revenue and take decisions, but the bigger the size, the greater the number of councillors necessary to retain local accountability.

The principle remains the same—that local services should be locally delivered, and that there should be a close connection between local councillors and the people who elect them. Too big an authority leads to too many councillors; and if the number is too small, local rapport is lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government must set aside their hostility to local government, and they must make clear what exactly they intend in the review. It is not accidental that the Government have made their blue paper so vague. They have done so to encourage people to believe that genuine consultation is taking place, but we shall not have genuine consultation. The pattern is clearly set. I get fed up with the fancy modern terms of enablers and providers. What do the Government think people in local government have been doing for so many years? They have been providing services and enabling people to take part in community groups to achieve a better quality of life. Therefore, the artificial distinctions between enablers and providers is nonsense, and yet that is the key to what the Government intend. The Government intend not to restructure local government but to dismantle it. The Government's clear intention is to diminish the role of local authorities. That will be a great mistake. Far from diminishing local responsibility, we ought to be increasing its powers and providing the tools for it to get on with the job.

Gentleman made no criticism of it. He made no effort to say why he has suddenly switched from the poll tax system to a property tax, which he condemned for so long and wished to abolish in Scotland.

The Secretary of State delivered what was described by a newspaper as a "robust speech". Some members of the Committee, who sat at the back, found the speech difficult to hear. The reporter who used the adjective "robust" to describe such a speech must spend most of his time in hospitals reporting medical cases. The speech was dull, badly delivered and, as my hon. Friends pointed out, highly contradictory. Conservative Members cannot escape their responsibility as perpetrators of the poll tax. I am glad that the hon. Members for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) nods. Conservative members are the guilty men. They imposed an unfair and unworkable tax on the people of Scotland. The people of Scotland will not forget that. They know who imposed the poll tax on them for the past two years, and that it will be in place for the remaining year before a general election. The poll tax has not disappeared.

The Government announced the abolition of the poll tax and the introduction of a new tax. They then announced the £140 reduction and a three-month, non-payment period for rebilling. The Government hoped that a general election would have occurred before people realised that the poll tax was still in place. They hoped to win an election on the basis of abolishing the poll tax. They believed that they would gain a marginal advantage. But the general election has not taken place. During the next few weeks, people will receive their poll tax bills for this year. Despite so-called handout of £140, many wil pay more, not less, as was explained by my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hughes).

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>67</span>
that the Minister will deal with that. The Secretary of State made no attempt to do so. If the Minister thinks that that plea comes only from the Labour party and from Labour-controlleld authorities, let me quote from last week's 	<i>Musselburgh News</i>—an unlikely source. Dr. David Whiteford, an East Lothian Conservative, has written to the Secretary of State asking him to give an emergency grant to East Lothian district council—a Labour-controlled local authority—to solve its financial problems. I hope that the Minister will listen to a Conservative councillor who is reported in the paper as saying that he welcomed the new tax and that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the 'anomalies, injustices and mistakes inherent in the old system"—</p></blockquote>
the poll tax—
	<br><blockquote><p>""would be seen to be removed" but he did see a need for more property bands."</p></blockquote>
That comes from a Conservative who recognises an immediate problem that needs to be solved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said at the beginning of the debate, there must be an emergency package that includes an improved grant, immediate abolition of the 20 per cent. minimum payment, backdating of rebates to 1 April 1989 for those who are eligible and restoring to local authorities the ability to make judgments about which debtors to proceed against. That would at least ease the immediate financial burdens of local authorities and allow them to proceed toward a better system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us examine the better system that the Government are proposing. However much they may try to squirm, hide and pretend otherwise, their proposition is a form of rates. Of course, the hon. Member for Eastwood would not like to say to his constituents that the Government are returning to the rating system because he thinks that that would be immensely unpopular and perhaps it would. His constituents would certainly be the losers, as they should be, because they are the better off in our society. A tax system in which fair people can believe should require people who have more to pay more to provide the services that the local authority offers.

This is the Government who cut housing benefit for many people on the basis that they wanted to target benefit and ensure those who were worst off received the benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman believes that such benefit should be targeted, how can he support a 25 per cent. reduction for every person in the country on the basis of their property tax? That is not targeting. As my hon. Friend for Garscadden says, why should he, as a well-paid Member of Parliament, pay 25 per cent. less than the couple living next door to him, when he is probably better off than they are?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Garscadden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Steady on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may have a few doubts about that, but there must be some form of targeting.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>68</span>
We accept the principle that we must look after the single and the elderly who do not have the income that they once had, but that is done best through a rebate system and not by payment of 25 per cent. to everybody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there must also be changes in the banding. As Dr. Whiteford said, there must more bands to ensure a proper distribution of tax between those who are better off and those who are very poor. There has to be a better system than the one that the Government are proposing. I gather that there was talk initially of 14 bands, which was then reduced to seven and at one point the figure looked as though it would be increased to nine. We need more bands to ensure that the system will work more fairly than has been suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having returned to a property tax, I do not know why the Government could not accept that they should return to a fair property tax. They shouldd ensure that the tax comes into force much more quickly than they suggest—1993. This may be their last opportunity because if they do not do it quickly, it will not be possible. Even now, they could restore the rating system that was in place before 1989 by using the existing rolls from 1985 and restoring and updating them in the next nine months. If the Government win the next general election, they will be able to reform or change the system. They will introduce a rating system anyway, so why not bring back the old one and reform that rather than leave the poll tax in place? Fewer and fewer people will pay it and that will create even more difficulties for local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The contributions by members of the Scottish National party were interesting. The hon. Members for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) and for Dunfermline, West (Mr. Douglas) criticised the Government's new tax, almost rejecting it out of hand, because they want a local income tax. They abandoned their non-payment campaign on the basis that the new tax was fairer and they could therefore accept it. The non-payment campaign was a political weapon aimed at the Labour party, not at the Government. When the SNP realised that it was becoming a political embarrassment, they were quick to find any excuse to get rid of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's support of the poll tax and his wish to use national insurance numbers to collect it should be an embarrassment to him. The SNP gave practical alternatives. We proposed a detailed, costed local income tax scheme which would solve the problems that afflict the Scottish population. We were involved in constructive dialogue: the Labour party offered no alternative. Its attitude to local government is thoroughly confused.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not confused about local government finance. We have a clear policy and I am not embarrassed by it. It took three years for the SNP to work out what happened because its members refused to serve on the Committee that examined the Bill introducing the poll tax, and to do anything in Parliament to oppose the introduction of the poll tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Inland Revenue is not capable of handling a local income tax at present, even if Parliament wanted

it. Local income tax will never be acceptable to the public as a local tax, because it will not be accountable to people locally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that local income tax is not possible. Why is that system of local government funding acceptable to the populations and Governments of so many other European countries?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because they have different ways of raising income tax and different systems of local government. The SNP and the Liberal Democrats should recognise that almost every country in the western world has some form of property tax. Their proposal would mean that there was no tax on property and that would make Britain almost unique in that regard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a local tax. It is not accountable to local people and would not be perceived as a local tax. It would be raised every year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I shall state our view on local government reorganisation. First, it must be part of a Scottish Parliament. It cannot and should not be merely an attack on existing local government. The two-tier system of local government introduced in 1974 worked well. Most local authorities tried hard to defend their people against Government attacks in the past 12 years. They did extremely well in limiting the damage to local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Scottish Parliament, directly elected by the Scottish people should decide whether to reform local government. There is no point in deciding to instiitute a Scottish parliament and then taking decisions for it before it is established. The Labour party believes that there should be single-tier local authorities. I disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Rutherglen (Mr. McAvoy) in that I believe that those local authorities should be big enough to allow them to act as a counterbalance to the Scottish Parliament. I believe in the devolution of power to Scotland, but not in the need for an all-powerful, central Scottish Parliament. There must also be a further devolution of power to strong local authorities which could deal with a Scottish Parliament and, on occasion, stand up to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends the Members for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) and for Glasgow, Central (Mr. Watson) have spoken about the need to establish direct links with Europe. Small local authorities would not be able to do that. Some of the powers of the smallish local authorities, such as Eastwood or Rutherglen, would pass to the Scottish Parliament. Centralisation of power, either in Westminster or a Scottish Parliament, would be a mistake.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is dealing with a very important matter, but I seek a clarification of the Labour party's position. Is the Labour party against the establishment by local authorities of joint boards to resolve the problem of size, about which the hon.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>70</span>
Gentleman has spoken? If so, is it not clear that local authorities will be very large as a consequence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman were to read our policy document, he would discover that we do not advocate a common structure for the whole of Scotland. In certain areas there will be large, strong local authorities which will handle all functions. In some cases, joint boards may be necessary, but the Labour party view is that they should not be a common structural feature across Scotland, because they are not the most democratic way in which to run local government services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next general election will be a turning point for local government in Scotland. if, by some unlikely mischance, the Conservative party should win again, they will produce a plan that will lead to very small local authorities of the size of Eastwood—which the Minister will not willingly give up—many of whose functions will be taken over by boards. Other functions will be privatised into local companies. Those small local authorities will be forced to put out to tender the few services that have not already been hived off. Increasingly, in-house bids will be the exception rather than the rule, and we shall see the disappearance of local democracy as we know it. When the Labour party wins the general election, we shall establish a Scottish Parliament which, in turn, will promote strong, democratic local government. Moreover, local authorities will have a proper financial base, which will allow them to take the decisions for which they are responsible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What was interesting about the speech of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) was what he omitted to say. Especially interesting was his failure to answer the detailed questions put to him on Tuesday by the hon. Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Douglas) about Labour's plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has covered a wide range of issues. Hon. Members have raised many points today and in the debate on Tuesday. Several hon. members on both sides of the Committee, including my Right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, have apologised for not being present, so I refer to any hon. Member who is not present, I mean no criticism. I accept that hon. members have other commitments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some hon. Members have made constituency points. The hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan) was right to say that he could give only a prelimianry response to the consultation paper as it had been published only recently. I should stress that, on structure, this is a two-stage consultation exercise. First, the published consultation paper sets out the general principles and the consultation period for that will end on 31 October. Secondly, a subsequent paper will point more specifically in the direction in which the Government wish to move. That will also be a consultation exercise in rather more detail than the present one. The hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) and my hon. Friend the Member for

Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) and others rightly said that the exercise should not be—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When shall we have a White Paper? Can the Minister give us a date?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give a date at this stage. It will be a two-stage process. I shall come back to the hon. Gentleman later about timing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I stress to the hon. Members for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) and for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) that we are examining the structure, functions and finance of local government together—it is the first time that that has been done in the post-war period—but it does not mean that we intend to implement all the conclusions of that review at the same time. That would be a recipe for chaos.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was surprised by the timetable suggested by the hon. Member for Angus, East. He said that the Government had got it the wrong way round in having finance ahead of structure. The implications of that are that, first, there should be a commission. That would take some time. Secondly, we should implement changes in structure: that, too, would take time. He suggested that we should then make changes in finance. Clearly the SNP believes that the community charge should remain until about 1996.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that that is nonsense. We have already explained to the Government that local income tax could be introduced almost immediately. It is a fairer system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government made a mess of local government finance and structure. Scotland needs a comprehensive package of those elements that would work. The Government's record has been atrocious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said earlier that the Government were wrong to make the changes to finance ahead of the changes to structure. I hope that the SNP can sort itself out before we have another debate on local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The criticisms made by the hon. Member for Cathcart of a local income tax were, on the whole, correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee East (Mr. McAllion) and others have raised points on local government expenditure. There has been a 9.6 per cent. increase in real terms in Government grants under this Government. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland mentioned that on Tuesday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How much this year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:: The Government grant does not take into account the community charge grant being paid this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be no need to remind the Committee about the importance of controlling local authority
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>72</span>
expenditure. Hon. Members made no reference to that. Local authorities account for one sixth of gross domestic product in Scotland: they are big business in the Scottish economy and sizeable businesses in the United Kingdom's economy. Local authority expenditure also affects the resources available for other public sector programmes in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right Hon. Friend the Secretary of State is responsible for public expenditure in Scotland; grants to local authorities, local authority capital allocations and non-domestic rates account for roughly half that public expenditure. The resources available to my right hon. Friend for his programmes are related, by formula, to comparable programmes in England. Before anyone criticises that arrangement, I remind hon. Members that a Labour Government introduced it. The more money we commit to local authority expenditure, the less there is available to support developments in other services, such as the national health service or the trunk road network.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind) was Secretary of State, he continually found it necessary to allocate extra resources to grants for local authorities. Those resources could have been devoted to Scottish Office programmes. What is the Labour party's policy on that key issue? That point was not answered during the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr Dewar) reminded us last week that a Labour Government were responsible for the main outline of the Scottish capping legislation on the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1966. A Labour Secretary of State for the Environment described local authority spending as a party that was now over. Does the Labour party support the last Labour Government's position on local authority expenditure? That Government's Scottish Office circular of October 1976 stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The necessity for severe restraint in expenditure in the national interest has been stressed … since before local authority reorganisation … local authorities must review their … programmes with the greatest stringency, bearing in mind that the likely lack of relevant expenditure … will involve a significant reduction … in real terms from the level of the local authorities' budget estimate".</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>It is nonsense to claim that the need to control local authority expenditure was invented by the present Government.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That comment did not get much of a reaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do the hon. Members for Garscadden and Cathcart accept the last Labour Government's position on local authority expenditure, or do they agree with the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) that a future Labour Government would have no control over local authority expenditure? They can take either position, but not both.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many detailed issues were raised during the debate. The hon. Member for Dundee, East and my hon. Friend the Minister for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) referred to competitive tendering. I shall put the record straight. The Government have strongly supported
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0339">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>73</span>
the search for value for money by the introduction and subsequent extension of compulsory competitive tendering, which has forced local authorities to re-evaluate the performance of their direct labour organisations. It has obliged them to tackle inefficiencies that were previously undetected or conveniently ignored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Competitive tendering is second nature to businesses in the private sector. Opposition Members would not think twice about it when getting work done on their own houses. Yet COSLA has fought competitive tendering tooth and nail and Labour authorities in Scotland have done everything possible to prevent it from working. They have spread misleading propaganda and they refuse to provide hard information about the savings that competitive tendering has achieved. Compulsory competitive tendering has improved productivity enormously in the services to which it applies. I am pleased to announce that the Government are taking steps to examine how it could be applied other local government services, especially administrative services. I hope that Scottish authorities and COSLA will be keen to take part in that examination, and that Opposition Members will offer their encouragement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Hon. Members from Lothian constituencies made specific allegations on Tuesday that in some way their region is cheated when Government support is distributed. I wish to put on record that those allegations are nonsense. They reveal a total lack of understanding of the way in which aggregate external finance is distributed. The system is straightforward. First, Government support is issued to equalise differences in each authority's spending needs as assessed by the client group methodology, which is agreed with COSLA and kept under continual review by the distribution committee of the working party on local government finance. The second stage is to distribute the remainder of the support on a straight per capita basis. The system is open and entirely above board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

experience and service in local government finance that Conservative Members do not have. I noticed my hon. Friends' look of puzzlement as they listened to the Minister's explanation, which he was forced to read word for word because he cannot keep up with himself. The truth behind the gobbledegook is that, according to Scottish Office figures for the eighth year in succession Lothian council has recieved less in Government grant per head of population than any other regional council. For the past seven years, its spending has been below the Scottish average. The Minister must admit the truth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Lothian has had a lower level of grant distribution for a number of reasons. The proportion of pupils in education authority schools is low, and the area is not as deprived as, say, Strathclyde. It is a compact region, with a relatively short road length compared with, say, Dumfries and Galloway. The hon.

The hon. Member for Cathcart has outlined the proposal that we should return to the rating system before April 1992. The suggestion is bizarre, bearing in mind how the old rating system has been criticised by the leader and deputy leader of his party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To reintroduce old-style rates would be entirely impractical. It would be necessary to resurrect and update old rating lists, to review and take account of material changes to properties since April 1989 and of changes to the stock to devise a new rebate scheme. The Government would have to determine how to distribute grant on a new basis and, consider and, if necessary, allow for the transitional implications for individuals and local authorities affected by the changes. They would have to make primary and secondary legislation implementing those preposals to take effect before April next year. Leaving aside the question of desirability, even if they were elected

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>75</span>
tomorrow, the Labour party could not introduce old-style rates before 1 April 1993.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In effect, the hon. Member for Cathcart is suggesting that Scotland should have three different local government financial systems in three consecutive years. That would be a recipe for chaos.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many hon. Members spoke about revaluation—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Committee is becoming very unsettled. I ask hon. Gentlemen to give the Minister a hearing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin. I am sorry that what I am saying does not have the Opposition's unanimous support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the community charge and the new council tax and revaluations. The hon. Member for Cathcart alleged that the council tax is a property tax and is essentially the same as rates. That is nonsense. It is a new tax with a combined property and personal element. For example, the provisions for second homes will be subject to 50 per cent. of the bill. In essence, it is a 50 per cent. property and 50 per cent. personal tax. The new system will not require the general revaluations necessary in a rating system; only partial revaluations will be needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members mentioned local government structure—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will Eastwood go?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have never said that the boundaries of Eastwood district are inviolate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no hidden agenda, as the hon. members for Cathcart alleged. There will be a consultation period, followed by a second consultation period. That exercise will take full and careful account of every point made, not only, by the organisations which officially receive copies of the consultation document, but by members of the public and other organisations. There must be a basis of acceptance for the new system. The new local government system must relate to communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt the committee and other forums will return to the issues raised during the debate. The results of the Government's comprehensive review have already borne fruit in the reduction of the community charge and in the introduction in April 1993 of a new tax. The review is proceeding in a thorough, ordelry and business-like way, in marked contrast to the confused position presented by the Labour party today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
