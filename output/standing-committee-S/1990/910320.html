	<br><q><p>That the Committee has considered the Housing Benefit (General) Amendment No. 3 Regulations 1990.</p></q>
I am pleased to serve under you, Mr Leadbitter, on my first statutory instrument Committee as Opposition spokesman, and thank you in advance for the guidance which I am sure that you will give me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations raise the subject of inadequate provision for residential care charges and the failure of community care, to which I shall refer later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations, which were placed in the House of Commons Library on 29 October 1990, provide that elderly and vulnerable people who have £8,000 or more in property or savings, and who are too old and sick to care for themselves will alone among the population, have their entitlement to housing benefit removed, and will be unable to claim any means-tested benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After April 1986, people in care homes who were above the income support capital limit were able to claim housing benefit, which was related only to housing cost in respect of care home fees. It was a little-known provision that was not publicised by central Government or by local authorities, and very few claims were made under it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The capital limit for housing benefit was raised from £8,000 to £16,000 in April 1990, when the measure was more widely publicised. As a result, many more claims have been made, with elderly people seeking to evade the poverty trap of income support and residential care—which is why the Secretary of State has introduced the present change to the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unlike income support regulations, which deliberately incorporate anomalies from the old supplementary benefits scheme, thereby impoverishing care and nursing home residents in the name of market regulations, housing benefit regulations have until now been free of such anomalies. They have treated equally all persons who are liable for housing costs. The regulations will destroy that equality, penalise those who have been wise enough to put something aside for their old age, or force them to sell a small house cheaply when they enter residential care. The regulations will ensure that people will enter the frequently-seen downward spiral towards begging—from sharing a room with four or five others, to eviction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations demand one thing of those in residential care—that they use all their capital over the £8,000 limit. They scrimped and saved to get that capital together throughout their lives, and must exhaust much of it if they are to receive any help with meeting the cost of their residential home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
Yesterday, the Chancellor of the Exchequer shifted about £4.25 billion from local government to central Government spending, to cover their embarassment over the poll tax—Yet, in sharp contrast, under these regulations, the Government will make a saving from elderly people in residential care so small that it cannot be quantified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It shows Parliament's twisted sense of priorities, that this change in housing benefit regulations would have taken place without any debate had not the Labour party chosen to pray against it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However eloquent the Opposition's arguments—considering my cold, I shall not pretend that my arguments will be eloquent—we could not force a vote that would block the regulations. I shall digress no further into parliamentary procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Behind, the problems surrounding this issue is the most successful privatisation of the Conservative era—the privatisation of the elderly. "Granny farms" is the cynical and tragic term abroad. I do not use that term with any pleasure but, sadly, it sums up the ethics of a minority of people who have sought to exploit the boom in private provision for the elderly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The number of claimants in residential and nursing homes has increased from 12,000 in December 1979, at a cost of £10 million, to 189,000 in May 1990, at a cost of more than £1·25 billion. That is a massive explosion in public expenditure under a Government who pride themselves—at least rhetorically—on their control of public expenditure. Perhaps the Minister will tell us whether the Government, while expecting some increase, expected a bonanza of such magnitude. I suspect not, and that that is why some serious problems have developed since.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of us know from bitter experience that reduced provision by local authorities is the other side of the privatisation coin. Regardless of one's opinion about that, there can be no doubt—certainly in my consitituency, and I know that other hon. Members have encountered similar problems—that the squeeze on local authorities, whereby billions have been stripped away form council budgets, has led to the closure of residential homes in the public sector. That happened at the same time as the private sector enjoyed a massive expansion. Was that see-saw designed to help those in need of residential care, about whom I hope that we are all concerned, or was it meant to massage the public expenditure figures?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fewer than half the registered residential and nursing homes in the United Kingdom will accept people who are dependent on benefits unless those people can cover the shortfall between their beneift rate and their charge made by the home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was clearly demonstrated by a recent survey conducted by the charitable organisation the Elderly Accommodation Council which showed a weekly gap of £9 between the income support received by a pensioner in a residential home and the amount charged by residential homes this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation for people who need nursing home care is even worse. The gap in their case is £20.67 per week. It seems that when income support goes up—and I really concede that there have been increases in income support for such people—an increase in fees of follows almost instantaneously
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0484">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
That is a problem for the Under-Secretary. I am pleased to pay tribute to her work in that area before she became Minister. Her efforts were noted. I hope that she will put the same drive into her ministerial work in respect of residential homes. Such flattery might even gain some concessions during the course of these brief proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I doubt it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I return to the survey from the Elderly Accommodation Council, which may prove more persuasive than myself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position that it outlined will worsen over the coming year, despite the increased payments that are due in April. According to the council's survey, registered home charges will need to increase by 10 per cent. this financial year, as well as absorb the April rises. The council estimates that the shortfall will increase this financial year to £20.67 per week for the elderly in residential homes, and to a staggering £52.54 per week on average for those in nursing homes. Those shortfalls are for people who need minimum care. People with greater needs, who are incontinent or confused, will face higher charges and greater shortfalls. If they depend on income support to meet the fees that they must pay, their future looks bleak. The Government admitted eighteen months ago, that half of all claimants in homes faced a shortfall. The gap between income support payments and the fees has widened considerably since then, and it may continue to do so in the future. The problem will worsen because more people will be drawn into the trap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Claimants do not receive the full rate of income support unless they have less than £3,000 of capital. It is vicious in the extreme to expect such people to meet those large shortfalls from their own pockets. Relatives are also drawn into the trap, because if their mothers and fathers cannot pay the fees out of their own pockets, they feel that they should make good the shortfall, and are sucked into that extension of the poverty trap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Current residents and their families face a financial nightmare now. The delays in implementing community care which has been postponed until 1993, means that more and more elderly people find themselves between the devil and the deep blue sea. They cannot get the help they need to continue living in their own homes, but they will be turned away from residential or nursing homes because their income will not cover their fees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will say what will happen to community care, because that matter is of concern to everybody, regardless of party. Community care is a fine and humane concept, and a great idea to which we can all subscribe. However, it is in danger of being squeezed to oblivion between political expediency and the need to control public expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of the difference between the fees and the money available will always reassert itself, whatever care system we have—be it private or public, a mixture of the two, local authority provision for community care out of the rate support grant, or district health authority residential care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations refer to one small group of people who are suffering as a consequence of that squeeze —those with between £8,000 and £16,000 of capital. At one time, that might have seemed an immense sum of money, and sufficient to have seen someone through to the end of their days. These days, many find that £3,000 is only just enough
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
for a rainy day, which often means the rainy day of their burial. It is the money that they have put aside for their funeral and a few things for their family at the time of their death. Such people do not have a vast amount of money swilling around—and what money they do have has been saved after a lifetime of work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister comment on the problems faced by 16 and 17-year-olds, to which the Social Security Advisory Committee report referred? In their response, the Government agreed closely to monitor the situation. I shall be grateful if the Minister will find time—not in response to this debate—to write to hon. Members and to explaining specifically what "closely monitor" means. Is the Government's response the result of letters from hon. Members? will there be some constant research into the development of 16 and 17-year-olds? Is there a named individual in the Department who can answer such questions? The form in which the monitoring will take place is something in which all hon. Members are interested. They will want to ensure that the Government have made a proper response to the advisory committee's report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I arrived this morning, I felt very happy—but after listening to the debate, it appears that, at the age of 72, I do not have much time left.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.46 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Lester 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that this issue concerns many of us—especially the delay in implementing care in the community, which is designed to fulfil that range of care which is so essential with an increasing elderly population. From 1990, onwards, there will be 3 million people aged over 80, and we all recognise that that demographic change must be provided for in a genuinely sensitive way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As changes rise, some people will be unable to meet them, and their income and capital will decline to zero. Suggestions were made to my hon. Friend's predecessors in anticipation that that would happen, and there are constituency cases to prove it; possibly one of the answers is that within the Department of Socal Security, one officer in every region should be given the responsibilty for dealing with distressing individual cases—though none of us wants them to arise in the first place. I refer to those who have lived in a nursing or residential home for the past 10 years; who are frail and old; and who discover that the home itself cannot continue to subsidise their continued occupation, although many homes have willingly done that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those odd circumstances one hopes that there could be sufficient flexibility to allow one officer in every region to have the power to check two facts. The first is, that the person had lived in that home for a considerable period—and that it was their home. The second, that the changes at that residential or nursing home are the same for all and are not unreasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The officer should then be able to make special arrangements to prevent the agonising situation of people looking for somewhere cheaper, when in many cases they have already gone from having a room to their own to multi-occupation. The thought of having to move again to find somewhere cheaper—even if it existed— is far too heavy a burden to place on someone in their 80s.

My hon. Friend the Minister is anxious to close a loophole in housing benefit, but there is the other problem that I mentioned, and I will be grateful if she can give some indication of how the Department will deal with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.48 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Miss Anne Widdecombe)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) on his first performance in a Committee dealing with a statutory instrument. I am sorry that it was bedevilled by his cold, which I understand he contracted as a result of going to Moscow. Perhaps there is some lesson for him to derive from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been little opposition to the regulations this morning. Most of the concern that has been expressed relates to the adequacy of income support levels for people in residential and nursing homes, and to the future of community care, but this is not the forum in which to resolve those issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subject of this morning's debate is the anomaly of a benefit that is designed to cover rent being used to cover both rent and care, so that income support and housing benefit are used to cover the same thing. The Government think that is wrong. Income support is designed to cover care. Special income support levels have been made available for those in homes, so the Government believe that the anomaly of using housing benefit to purchase care should be removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise the worries that hon. Members have about the more general issue, and I thank the hon. Member for Nottingham, North, for his kind reference to my special interest in this subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Mr. Lester) made a specific point about providing an officer in each local authority, before community care comes on-stream, to look into the cases of people who cannot pay the fees charged by homes. Local authorities already have powers to buy beds in homes, and to charge the residents the fees that they would have been charged in a local authority home. Therefore, although local authorities cannot top-up provision in the same way that they will be able to do when community care comes on-stream, they can top-up now through the method of buying-in beds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, district health authorities have the power to contract for beds in nursing homes. In very serious cases involving frail, elderly people who can no longer meet fees and who are confronted by a substantial gap between them and income support, the fall-back position is already available. However, it is rarely used because it is an extremely costly option for the local and district health authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Nottingham, North, used—though it is not his phrase—the ugly description "granny farm". Those of us who know of the admirable work done by the residential and nursing home sector do not accept the application of that description to the vast majority of institutions in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In another sense, the hon. Gentleman was right. There has been a perverse trend for people to go into residential care when they could continue to live at home, if they had the right support. That is behind the whole community care programme, and is one of the problems that it is designed
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
to address. It should remove the element of "granny farming", and the perverse incentive to enter residential care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about 16 and 17 year-olds. The regulation refers specifically to registered residential homes. Young people who are found in such establishments are likely to be vulnerable and eligible for income support. They may be on youth training schemes and be receiving the ordinary rates, or they may be severe hardship cases. My point is that, in the context of these regulations, 16 and 17 year-olds are provided for by the income support system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have fully protected anyone who was receiving housing benefit before October 1990, when the change in the regulations was announced Anyone who was receiving housing benefit for their homes' fees, or who had claims in before that date which were subsequently granted, will be fully protected, even if they leave the home for a while and return to it, or if they move to a new home. We are not taking anything away—we are not "saving", as the hon. Gentleman put it, on existing cases. From that point of view, the measure is cost-neutral.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Housing benefit will also remain available to those in work and to those paying rent to a close relative, both of which groups are ineligible for income support, and to those who already receive that benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has centred on an anomaly in the use of benefits; the underlying concern should be discussed in another forum when the upratings are announced. However, I hope that I have persuaded the committee that the exemptions are covered, and so are people who made financial arrangements on the assumption that their existing housing benefit would continue. Sixteen and 17 year-olds who are affected by the regulation are also covered, by these neutral regulations which tidy up the existing situation and I which commend to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.55 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will touch briefly on several issues that arise from this morning's speeches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the hon. Member for Broxtowe (Mr. Lester) for his contribution. He too, is known for his concern about housing benefit policy not only in the House but his constituency and in my own area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The anomoly that has been the reference point for the debate means that another small slice is being taken away from people. It is so small that not even the Government can quantify it. None the less, those who have between £8,000 and £16,000 of capital, and who currently receive some benefit will in future have their claims disallowed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was right to make the distinction between future and present claims. Again, in an area that entails vast public expenditure, time is being spent in Committee discussing a relatively small number of people who will not be able to claim in future because they do not fall within the new criteria.

I admit that I spoke on a wider area than the regulations. I thank the Minister for pointing that out, and I am grateful to you, Mr. Leadbitter, for allowing a novice a bit of rope—perhaps to hang himself with. I was pleased to have the opportunity to raise those broader issues, which are of concern to all members of the Committee.

On the question of the 16 and 17-year-olds, I entirely support the report of the Social Security Advisory Committee about the regulations and I refer the Minister to paragraph 37, which mentions
	<br><q><p>"Those not entitled to that benefit because they have been found unavailable for or not actively seeking work."</p></q>
I am not sure whether the Minister's remarks were meant to cover such people, who would be caught in that trap through no fault of their own. They should be monitored to ensure that they do not slip through the net and become financially worse off.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Widdecombe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was referring to those 16 and 17year-olds who are living in registered residential or nursing homes. Sixteen and 17-year-olds who are not living in such accommodation, unavailable for work, and not recognised as severe hardship cases or as being in a vulnerable category, would not be covered. Within the context of the regulations, I was right to confine my remarks to that first group of 16 and 17-year-olds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that clarification. The fact that the distinction is so fine perhaps makes it all the more important that the monitoring to which I referred is carried out systematically and openly, so that everyone knows precisely which individuals will benefit and which will not.

The Minister referred to the local authority buying in beds. That is rather contradictory, because other Ministers are busy withdrawing rate support grant, which leads to the closure of beds provided by local authorities. I do not know whether the hon. Member for Broxtowe has encountered the same problems as I have, with local authority provision being reduced, while the Government are saying that private sector provision must be encouraged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities can only buy in beds if they have sufficient money. My anxiety about community care is that if it is dependent on rate support grant allocation, it might be difficult to make the provision that the local authorities believe is essential. If a responsible officer of the kind mentioned by the hon. Member for Broxtowe were in charge in a local authority—assuming that such an officer could be afforded—and if he were to reconsider the question after two or three years, he might find that, even if it were policy to accommodate such people, financial imperatives would cause them to be homeless. That is the fundamental anxiety of all those involved.

Finally, I emphasise that the Opposition fully support the concept of Community care, but it is nonsense that people who want to stay in their own home should, because of financial problems or other difficulties, be forced into accommodation that they would not otherwise choose. I stress that my reference to granny farms does not apply to the majority of homes, but there is a problem with a minority. It is a problem that the Government have recognised, and one that involves the wider issues of inspection and standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole area of residential care and the shortfall between income support and fees needs to be continually reviewed. I hope that those major issues will be on the Government's agenda until the next general election. I certainly hope that they will be the first priority of the next Labour Government. I urge the Committee to vote against the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The odd thing is that a Division will not make any difference, because the Committee is considering the regulations. No Committee dares to say that it has not considered them. That is one of the quirks of Parliamentary business.
