	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. Jeremy Hanley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Fisheries (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 1991.</p></blockquote>
The Order amends a number of the provisions of the Fisheries (Northern Ireland) Act 1966, which I will refer to as the 1966 Act, some of the equivalent provisions in the Foyle Fisheries (Northern Ireland) Act 1952 and one provision of the Diseases of Fish (Northern Ireland) Act 1967.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1966 Act was last amended in 1983 when, following the report of a committee of inquiry into angling in Northern Ireland, known as the Black report, the Fisheries Conservancy Board was restructured and enlarged. When the restructuring was completed the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the new board worked very closely in identifying all the amendments that were required to the 1966 Act and this formed the basis of the draft order published in 1988.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order differs in a number of respects from the proposal which was issued for consultation to take account of points that have been made during the process. Most of the comments received were generally favourable, but there were valid concerns raised and the Government has endeavoured very hard to accommodate these as far as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall briefly explain the main provisions of the Order. Article 4 extends the existing powers of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to develop derelict waters for angling—that is to say, waters where it is impossible to establish or to trace the owners of the fishing rights. The article provides that such waters may be developed either by the Department or by other organisations, for example, angling clubs, under schemes approved by the Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New provisions are included under article 6 relating to fish farming and the procedures to be adopted on receipt of applications for fish culture licences following representations made during the consultation stage that all applications for fish culture licences should be published and that there should be mandatory public inquiries to hear objections. The public inquiries will be held by the Water Appeals Commission for Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new provisions in article 11 will enable the Fisheries Conservancy Board to restock waters where pollution has caused fish to be killed and to recover the cost of restocking from the person convicted under the Fisheries (Northern Ireland) Act 1966. The new measures will provide a mechanism to make polluters pay for the damage they cause, in addition to the fine imposed for the criminal offence of pollution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
Articles 13, 15 and 16 increase protection for migratory fish in the vicinity of dams and mills by requiring the installation of fish passes in specified circumstances in dams built before 10 August 1842, by clarifying that the provisions on closure of mill sluices at weekends and when mills are not in use also apply to disused mills and by reducing the spacing of gratings at the point where water returns to a river or lake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The remaining provisions of the order introduce a number of changes to the existing legislation that are aimed mainly at improving the protection of fisheries and the enforcement of fishery legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am satisfied that the order represents a sound, forward-looking approach to the needs of ail involved in the fisheries of Northern Ireland. It has generally been welcomed by local interests, and the measures being taken will improve the development and protection of fisheries in Northern Ireland. The new provisions on the licensing procedures for fish farms will go some way towards easing public concern about consultation on what are important issues to the public concerning an industry that is playing an increasing valuable part in the economy of the Province. I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.34 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Londonderry, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Government for introducing the order. It has taken from March 1988 until now for the order to reach this Committee. That reflects the depth of consultation that has taken place and the importance of the order, which will change considerably fishery law in Northern Ireland and affect greatly owners of watermills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Minister and his predecessors for their courtesy and helpfulness in this matter. I am a keen angler—the work in this place keeps interfering with my angling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kevin McNamara 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kingston upon Hull, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not while there is a general election in the offing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am also in the happy position of owning two watermills; I cut my teeth on taking them apart and putting them together, so I know quite a bit about the matter. A long time ago I sent a lengthy submission to the Minister's Department and received helpful replies from his predecessor. I apologies for detaining the Committee, but those issues must be put on the record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We always make a statutory declaration that such matters should be dealt with by Bill rather than by order. Between June and December 1989 I kept asking that this particular matter be dealt with by a Bill. That is right and proper and the only sensible way of dealing with the matter. An enormous number of changes have been made. Other changes should have been made, or at least argued about in Committee with the Government giving their reasons for not accepting them. The measure is contentious, not as a party political issue, but in how it affects the constituents of all hon. Members in Northern Ireland. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon) is not here because he is also an angler and would have been able to bring further insights from his part of the Province to our deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had the perfect chance to produce a Bill that could have been discussed calmly and widely and turned into a vastly improved measure. The Minister sent us papers. I shall refer extensively to them because if the information
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0265">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
that they give us about the changes. I want also to draw to the Minister's attention some omissions from the order. I have been writing to his Department about the removal from rivers of gravel shoals. Local farmers and others in many parts of Northern Ireland have the right to remove gravel and sand from rivers and river banks. In the old days, when that was shovelled on to a cart drawn by a horse, no great damage was done. Nowadays, a JCB or other mechanical digger is used to dig the bed to a depth of 6 or 8 feet and the bed is then left bare.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On rivers such as the river Roe, my local one, where there are migratory fish—especially sea trout—and much night fishing, that practice is extremely dangerous. The right to take such action exists, but it is being exercised in a totally unacceptable manner. I wanted the order to include a provision to restrain the right of removal of gravel and sand bars to low-water level or just below. Then there would be no danger of someone drowning, because a tragedy is just around the corner. I know of one or two people who have had close calls. Many of those rivers are fished by children; the rivers are open to the general public for fishing in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order refers briefly to the Foyle Fisheries Commission. It is rarely mentioned in the correspondence, yet the Foyle Fisheries Commission covers a large chunk of the migratory game fisheries in Northern Ireland. I believe that the order extends widely to the Foyle Fisheries Commission area. Perhaps the Minister could clarify that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have liked the order to include provision for research on sea trout and for the restraint of commercial fishing in fresh water for coarse and game fish, which does not take place in many, if any other areas of the United Kingdom. I should have liked some reference to fishery rates, the real costs of pollution control and the restocking of rivers. Some years ago, a river in my constituency was massively polluted by the Department of the Environment. I glanced at the answers that I was given at that time. It would cost the Department of the Environment£46, 205 to restock the river. That is an example of the cost restocking and the difficulties that have been experienced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order should have included a better anaylsis of the statistics for game fish catches in Northern Ireland and examined the place of angling clubs in providing meaningful statistics rather than the nonsense that we receive when we ask people to fulfil the statutory requirements. People never do that and it is impossible to enforce those requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order contains much detail that the Committee cannot tackle satisfactorily. The Ulster Angling Federation submitted a comprehensive document to the Minister. Both he and the Department have taken an interest in it, and have answered many of the Ulster Angling Federation's questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department has also met many of the issues that I raised with the Minister. Between 1988 and 1991, there have been large chunks of new legislation. A Bill could have tackled that legislation far better than a statutory instrument. In a letter that I wrote in May 1988, I drew attention to the Irish Society, which has large fishery interests in county Londonderry. Most of those interests are now leased to local clubs. The clubs are not commercial undertakings. They are non-profitmaking, and are undertaken by local people for the benefit of local people. They do a good job. The interests of the Irish Society may
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
be affected by the order. That body is no longer the landowning power that it once was; it is now a purely charitable organisation. It would be wrong the cut back on its commendable work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Committee were considering a Bill, I should ask the Minister how the changes to the Foyle Fisheries (Northern Ireland) Act 1952 will affect the fowling rights on lough Foyle. Those rights are owned by the Irish Society. The game rights on the hills and other parts of county Londonderry will be affected by the changes. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in Northern Ireland claims the game rights in all the forests, but is has never paid the Irish Society for those rights. I believe that, legally, those rights still belong to the Irish Society. The same applies to the lease granted by the Department to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds for lough Foyle. I question the right of the Department to grant such a lease to anyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall briefly go through the comments that I made about the original order, the Minister's replies and my remaining anxieties. The issues are important to anglers and mill owners. Is the Minister aware of the enormity of the changes in the water rights of mill owners? I have no comments to make about articles 1 and 2. I asked about the practical implications of article 3, which were not included in the Fisheries (Northern Ireland) Act 1966. The 1966 Act gives some idea of the time scale for the correction of mistakes. The Minister should have answered some of the questions put by the Ulster Angling Federation on articles 3 and 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On article 4, I asked what was the definition of "derelict waters", who will decide whether the Department or a club would develop the waters, what proportion of derelict waters the Department intends to develop and whether commercial profit-making organisations will be allowed to develop waters and receive grant aid. Under the rules governing compensation, will an owner find himself paying the person to whom he had let the fishing rights for improvements or having to honour lifelong fishing permits granted by a former tenant? The answer to whether commercial organisations would be able to develop waters was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the provisions of these sections are now being made available to others, besides angling clubs, who wish to develop derelict waters for angling, provided these waters are made available to the public"—</p></blockquote>
I presume for payment—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and particularly where such development is in conjunction with the attraction of tourists.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The phrase 'approved association' has been amended to read 'approved developer' and the definition given in Section 3(12) widened to include persons, bodies or associations developing waters for angling. A new sub-section 3(13) has been introduced to provide that the Department may approve a developer only where angling will be provided to members of the public or is provided in association with hotels, guesthouses or boarding houses registered under the Development of Tourist Traffic Act (Northern Ireland) 1948."</p></blockquote>
There is a large tourist element in the order. The same words are repeated in the general comments sent by the Minister to other Northern Ireland Members of Parliament, none of whom, except the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh, participate in the pastime of angling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I welcome the order, some questions are raised by the Minister's answer. Some issues will be made clear by the passage of time and the application of the order, but we shall not all be happy. Paragraph 7A of article 5 of the 1988 order referred to fishing engines. I asked whether that measure could be refined. Paragraph
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0266">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
7A(2) allows the issue of complimentary permits to persons outside Northern Ireland. I asked the Minister to give examples of the type of people who would benefit from that proposal and I am still waiting for an answer. If complimentary permits are to be granted, Lord Mason should be granted one. He was a distinguished former Secretary of State who made use of the angling waters. I hope he will continue to do so. I dare not ask for one for myself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 6 is an important new article. It is welcome because it creates a law to govern those who want to keep fish farms, which were not adequately covered in previous Northern Ireland legislation. The change is clear-sighted. I hope that it will be applied more rigorously than the present planning laws are applied in some parts of the Province.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Procedures to be followed are set down in new article 31, which also gives the Water Appeals Commission for Northern Ireland the power to appoint assessors for public inquiries and appeals. The change in the law is important and welcome. It has had to be introduced in an order that has been lying around for three years. I question whether that is a satisfactory way to proceed, but a change of this enormity cannot be made overnight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 6 of the 1988 order removed the requirement to produce an annual report. I found that unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Lord Lyall pointed out in this letter of 20 June 1988 that a report on fisheries is included in the Department of Agriculture's Annual General Report while details of public expenditure on fisheries are contained in the public Appropriation Accounts. The format of the department's Annual General Report has since changed and I would accept that the fisheries content of the 1989–90 Report would not be adequate to meet the obligation of Section 22 of the 1966 Act. In the circumstances, while provisions of the Order remain unchanged, I can confirm that a separate Sea and Inland Fisheries Report will continue to be published unless future changes in editorial policy again render the Annual General Report a suitable vehicle for publishing the necessary information. I would also add that following comments received during the consultation period the requirement to publish particulars of expenditure and receipts under Section 22(c) of the 1966 Act is not now being revoked."</p></blockquote>
I welcome the change of heart by the Minister's department, as do the large number of anglers in Northern Ireland. I hope that that change is not reversed. That separate report should continue to be published in future, as it is a valuable source of reference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On old article 8, I asked about the practical implications of the extension of the board's powers. I also asked what criteria would be applied and who would be consulted before a bait or lure was prescribed. My question continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Is it the intention to introduce a tagging scheme for Salmon and, if so, why is this power not extended to the Foyle area? Also in KKK—"</p></blockquote>
which will not mean much to anybody who does not have the 1988 order—
	<br><blockquote><p>"why are seatrout mentioned as if they were normally looked upon as Salmon or Grilse? Surely this reference should be deleted."</p></blockquote>
The answer was that it was being deleted, so at least my knowledge of the difference between salmon, grilse and sea trout bore some fruit. It was also stated that an
	<br><blockquote><p>"additional subsection 8(2) has been introduced to enable the Fisheries Conservancy Board to enter into an agreement to enforce the fishing rights of private fisheries."</p></blockquote>
That statement was repeated in the general letter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
Two points arise from that question and answer. First, we are not told who will be consulted before a bait or lure is prescribed. I think that we should be told. A constant flood of new spinning baits appears every year. One, called the flying condom, appeared only two years ago and has been a very successful salmon bait, although any bait is successful if one fishes with it often enough. If baits are to be banned, we must know who is to assess them. The same is true of line strengths. We need to be told who makes the decisions and for what reasons. Trawling for slamon is unpopular in some areas and has been banned in a wide variety of waters. Why cannot we be told whether the decision rests with the Government or local people?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, new subsection (8)(2) enables the Fisheries Conservancy Board—and, I assume the Foyle Fisheries Commission—to enter into agreements to enforce the fishing rights of private fisheries. Has that provision been thought through properly? It is a very big change. We are not told what private fisheries are involved. I assume that they are those fisheries that are controlled by angling clubs, some of which also pay private bailiffs. I should be grateful to hear more about that from the Minister, as the fisheries bodies could be getting themselves into a very deep bog. It is a very wide power and there must be a limit. Does that power only cover river game fisheries, or does it include still water commercial fisheries? That is a big question, and needs to be answered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcomed old articles 8 and 9. The latter seemed to be a useful clarification of the law. However my welcome received no response. On old article 10, I asked what was meant by the term "owner of the waters", and whether that term included fishing rights, the bed of the river or lake, and so on. I also asked what would happen if the owner refused consent to clean up the water and restock, whether or not the owner were the polluter. I did not dream up those questions; I have had a lot of help from those who are more expert in fishery law than I am. they are worried about those matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I went on to ask:
	<br><blockquote><p>"What if the person has not been prosecuted although clearly at fault or the pollution arose as a result of an accident? It seems as if the question 'conviction' is not sufficient to deal with this problem as Courts need to make an order."</p></blockquote>
I said that article 10(7) seemed to allow the board and persons downstream of a pollution point to bring civil proceedings and added that that was surely a tortuous method of getting a stream or lake restored. My question continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"What is the position if the land owner refused access? Will the Criminal Justice Order 1988 still apply in this context and if so are the sums allowed large enough? What will the position be if the person is convicted under the Water Act? …Is any Government Body or the Board presently legally empowered to improve or restock a polluted fishery? Can the Board or any Government Body set out requirements as to the source of fish for restocking? Why yet again is there not a clause to cover pollution by the Crown?".</p></blockquote>
I mentioned earlier that the Department of the Environment spent £46,500 on a river in my constituency. I hope that something more will be done about that, because it is often difficult to prove the source of pollution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The genetic make-up of migratory fish is of great importance. Do the Government or the board intend to specify the source of fish for restocking? No doubt the Minister knows that there is only about a 200-mile radius from a salmon river before grave difficulties arise in the genetic make-up of fish. Such factors must be taken into

account. The difficulties that arise in the genetic make-up of the fish that are farmed on the west coast of Scotland are worrying. We do not want them to occur in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister cannot deal with those matters in his reply, I hope that he will write to me and make the position clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On article 11—it is article 10 in the published draft order—I questioned the definition of "owner of the waters". The Minister replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This has now been amended to read 'owner of the fishing rights'."</p></blockquote>
I assume that that covers the tenant of the fishing rights, too. If not, we shall be in a mess.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's reply continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"You also raised a point about the owner refusing the FCB consent to carry out remedial action. A number of comments received suggested that, as originally drafted, the proposed Section 47(3)(a) was unworkable because it required FCB to get the consent of the owner of the fishing rights. Sub-section (3)(a) has therefore been redrafted amending 'consent' to `consult'."</p></blockquote>
I suppose that after consultation the FCB can still do it.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Further consideration has been given to the suggestion that the FCB should be empowered to move where, say, an admission of liability has been secured."</p></blockquote>
I assume that that means through the courts.
	<br><blockquote><p>"The provision that the FCB first secures conviction under Section 47(1) of the 1966 Act is still included as it was considered unlikely that any party would willingly admit liability and incur the cost of restocking."</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"On the question of powers of access, additional powers have already been provided in Articles 26 and 27, and these powers have subsequently been amended to provide for search, and these, along with existing powers, are considered sufficient to enable FCB staff first to investigate a pollution incident, as they already do, and secondly to restore fish population.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I should add that as a result of other comments received the form of the Article has been changed somewhat introducing an independent arbitration procedure under the Arbitration Act (Northern Ireland) 1937 to replace the provision enabling the convicted person to make representations to the Board on its proposed works. It is considered that this is a better safeguard to test the reasonableness of the restocking proposed by the Board and the cost.</p></blockquote>
On section 47(3)(a) of the 1966 Act the reply says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The original proposal required the Fisheries Conservancy Board to obtain the consent of the owner of the fishing rights of waters damaged by pollution before restocking such waters. This has been amended so that they need only consult the owner, if he is known."</p></blockquote>
He is not always known. In the case of the county of Londonderry, will the owner to be consulted be the Irish Society? I should like an answer to that question. The reply goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This will enable the FCB to proceed with restocking, particularly even in situations where the polluter happens to own some of the fishing rights in the affected water or has a neighbour who would have withheld consent to shelter him."</p></blockquote>
So my questions have been answered in full. The same information was given in the general letter that was sent to all Northern Ireland Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked whether clarification was necessary of article 11 of the 1988 order, buy I did not receive an answer. I assume that it must have been considered necessary, or it would not have been included. I said that article 12
	<br><blockquote><p>"is the first of the articles which affects power generation and could have large implications for the owners of such dams. It is my view that each dam has its own characteristics and therefore each has to be considered on its own merits. Up to now the exemption powers have been sufficient to deal with the problem but I do feel that we are coming to a stage where an appeal or conciliation system needs to be created. It could take the form of a tribunal and interested parties could make their case and try to reach a mutually satisfactory conclusion."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
I recently received the following answer from the Minister:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Regarding your comments about an appeal or conciliation system, a right of appeal to the Water Appeals Commission has now been included where the Department refuses to grant an exemption for the requirement to construct a fish pass.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>It has been decided to introduce an additional sub-section …which requires the owner of a dam built before 1842 and brought back into use or had its use changed"—</p></blockquote>
that is the important phrase—
	<br><blockquote><p>"since the commencement of the Order to construct a fish pass in that dam."</p></blockquote>
That is a massive change, to which I shall return in a moment. I am most anxious about the Minister's reply, because its implications are far greater than he realises. Contained in his words is the proposal to retain property without paying compensation. In these days of increasing energy costs, it is increasingly valuable property. It is a serious matter for the owners of mill dams on small-spate rivers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order is specific and therefore dangerous, in that it raises enormous questions about people's rights to retain their property or to receive proper compensation. The mere fact that a mill is not in use today, because it may be uneconomical, does not alter the fact that the individual who owns that water power should have the right to use it in perpetuity. The river keeps flowing—unless it is in the south of England and folk drill holes and pump out the water.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On article 13 of the 1988 order I said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"each dam is unique. What is necessary for one may not be necessary, or even wite, at another. There is a vast difference between the conditions above a dam as compared to the situation below it. For example, I know of dams (one now removed) that are built on a sharp bend of the river."</p></blockquote>
In previous years, fisheries boards and fisheries protection organisations lamented the fact that weirs and dams were danger points for salmon. They discovered, when the darns were removed, that the large pool above the darn, and the refuge for fish that crossed the dam, went with it. Fish are therefore even more vulnerable in spate conditions than they were when crossing the dam. Dams are a two-edged sword—they carry some blessings and some dangers. The dangers can be overcome; therefore the benefits outweigh the danger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A dam built on a sharp bend in the river is technically a good site as the main force of the flood does not strike it squarely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My letter continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The effect for anglers of the pool above the dam is that anglers fish either from the bank opposite the dam or direct from the dam wall."</p></blockquote>
Sometimes high water is a good place to fish.
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the intention is to prevent poaching, such activity is very unlikely above the dam."</p></blockquote>
Poachers catch the fish when they are crossing the dam.
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is usually carried out when migratory fish congregate below a dam and they may in fact be in a pool some distance from the dam wall. I, therefore, conclude that a specified distance should not be written into the Order, but rather each case should be treated on its merits. The views of the local club would be valuable. Again, an appeals system should be initiated."</p></blockquote>
The answer stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Your point that each dam is unique has been accepted. The distance from a dam within which fishing is permitted has now been amended to read 'within 5 metres or such other distance as may be prescribed by bye-laws', although the provision prohibiting fishing from any position on a dam remains,"</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0268">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
Although I understand that, I am happy about it because the area of my local dam is excellent for fishing so I am missing the best lie in the pool.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is not considered necessary to initiate an appeals procedure as the members of the FCB"</p></blockquote>
the Fisheries Conservancy Board
	<br><blockquote><p>"represents various interests including the CBI."</p></blockquote>
Does the Foyle Fisheries Commission membership include membership of the CBI? Does it include representation from the small mill owners who do not qualify for membership of the CBI? I suspect not. Therefore, an important body of opinion regarding water power and rivers has no means of making representations to those who make the decisions. I am not desperately happy with how the matter has been left.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
About article 14 I said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This article has far reaching effects especially for peresons who now wish to use their water power to generate electricity for sale to the public supply. All water turbines to be efficient have to be designed for the head and flow of water at their installation site."</p></blockquote>
They are tailor-made, costly machines. It is difficult to figure out how much water to put through a turbine. The amount changes, depending on the uses to which the turbine is put. Therefore, the turbines are tailor made for their site and for their use. I continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where there are multiple turbines which can be individually turned on and off, depending on the flow, very efficient use can be made of the available water at any given time. However, very many of the turbines in Northern Ireland are single machines placed on a spate river. In such situations they have been designed to deal with a certain flow of water and generally this is above the flow in extreme drought conditions."</p></blockquote>
That is called the mean water flow, which is about twice the minimum drought flow in a spate river.
	<br><blockquote><p>"This means that in such conditions the maximum percentage of flow must be directed to the turbine, especially since the large amount of hill drainage"</p></blockquote>
and there has been a huge amount over the years.
	<br><blockquote><p>"has so altered the flow profile of many streams. It is my view that if this section is to go through in its present form then the exemptions referred to will have to be such as to allow present mills to operate as hitherto. Indeed it seems to me that if restrictions in line with those proposed are rigidly followed then the Department will find itself in the courts for presuming to remove a valuable asset, i.e. water power without compensation. Because of this the words "injuriously interfered" must mean that the efficiency of the turbines has been affected and an exemption must be granted.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>As a matter of detail I would be obliged if you could tell me what is the intention of the change on subsection (a)(i). So far as subsection (a)(ii) is concerned this may not necessarily be wise as in most cases mill watercourses have resident fish in them and cutting off the water supply would lead to their destruction.</p></blockquote>
I shall return to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The best way to deal with this problem (where an exemption is not granted) is to (1) stop the turbines, or (2) greatly reduce the flow of water down the watercourse. Of course, in many cases in spate rivers migratory fish move very little, if at all,"</p></blockquote>
sea trout do, but salmon do not.
	<br><blockquote><p>"in drought periods and if they are encouraged to do so by stopping mills they may simply move up to the mill dam and become easy prey to poachers when the mill restarts."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
From practical experience, I am saying that it is better to let the blooming thing run all the time in drought conditions as the fish will not pass the outlet. However, if it is stopped, the fish will run up and get caught, whenever the mill restarts.
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the final subsection (d) "gate valves" is added to the to the definition of sluices. Normally such valves are fitted immediately adjacent to the turbine. Am I to understand that the original subsection reference to sluices was a reference to sluices which fulfilled the same function at the same point as gate valves? Finally, yet again each instance has to be treated as a unique site, is this the intention of this section?"</p></blockquote>
I received a long answer. Some of it is good, but some is rubbish. I shall tackle both the good and the bad points.
	<br><blockquote><p>"I note your comments on the generation of electricity. I should emphasis that it is not our intention to inhibit the use of water power as a source of energy.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>You are concerned that present operators should not be affected by the proposal. The effect of a new section 58(3)(a) is that those operating before this Amendment Order shall not be affected, the good defence that sluice closure would interfere with the machinery or water power of the mill will continue and they will not need to seek an exemption certificate under section 58(3)(a).</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>As you note, the good defence of 'injuriously interferes' for present mill and turbine operators does include interference with the effective working of the mill, but this good defence will not apply to new operators or where there is a change in use of the water power."</p></blockquote>
That issue worries me. Not one mill dam in Northern Ireland—a part from large undertakings—is unaffected by those words. Most of the small water mills in Northern Ireland were built as corn or flax mills. Some are now used to generate electricity. If the same price is paid for electricity from non-fossil fuels in Northern Ireland as is paid in Great Britain, the number of mills that convert to that use will increase. The mills are also used as draw-off points for fish farms. However, any mills that are converted from their original purpose fall foul of the order. How water power is used should not be relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The power of water lies in the creation of an energy source. The alteration to the Act takes away from people a right of property without compensating them for that loss. The Minister will not be very happy if the Department goes to court to try to enforce that change. It is a dangerous path to follow. The inclusion of article 15 in the order is a bad mistake. On the surface, it is an attempt to remove dangers that threaten migratory fish or mill dams and to improve angling. However, it has another application, which may prove to be a minefield. It would have been better to tackle the matter in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's reply continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I should add, however, that a right of appeal to the Water Appeals Commission is included where the Department refuses to grant an exemption certificate or issues one subject to conditions or varies or revokes an existing exemption.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>You say that in most cases mill watercourses have resident fish in them and cutting off the water supply would lead to their destruction. There should be no fish in mill races if mill owners have gratings required under section 59 in place."</p></blockquote>
That is bunkum.' It is impossible to make a grating that is small enough to prevent the entry of small fish. Fish have a natural tendency to grow. Anyone who has fished for trout in the streams of. Northern Ireland knows that the mill stream is one of best places for catching a bag of brownies. The Minister's words are a cop-out. There are always fish in mill races. It is foolish to claim that they can be kept out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's reply continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Regarding your comments about the effects of drought conditions and low flows, it is the view of the FCB, which is responsible for the conservation and protection of fisheries, that with the vast majority of millis, sluice closures protect and facilitate the free passage of fish most

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
of the time. In drought conditions, even with sluice closures, river flows may be inadequate to cause fish to migrate but there is still a need to maintain a flow of fresh water down the main river course to protect fish life and flora and fauna generally between abstraction point to the discharge point from a mill. Mill operators cannot expect to abstract all the river flow during drought conditions where a derelict mill is brought back into use or there is a change of use which creates a greater demand in the amount of water abstracted.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>covering your point about gate valves, the short answer is yes and our expanded interpretation is to clarify the point."</p></blockquote>
The 1842 Act placed considerable restriction on water use. One of its main arguments was that a certain amount of water should always escape down a river, even when a mill was operating. In reality, because of the construction methods used in the old weirs and mill dams, a certain amount of water always got through. The provisions of the 1842 Act were not appropriate for spate rivers. Fish could survive as long as a certain amount of water flowed, but the article would close the loophole in the 1842 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister is aware that, before that Act, owners of mill dams did not have to make allowance for water flowing down the river when the mills were running. Nowadays, people aim to save every drop of water, with the result that dams from which there is no escape are being built. Rivers are left pretty well dry between the abstraction and return points. I appreciate what the Minister is trying to do, but this is not the right way to do it. Something should be written into the article to allow a small escape. Fish do not need much water, but there is a real problem that must be solved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reply continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I note your comments on these provisions and will attempt to clarify them further. The reduction of bar spacing is only required at the tail race to protect migratory trout as they move up river because it was considered that the existing 2 inch spacing in the bars was not small enough to ensure that trout did not enter the watercourses. The new spacings will apply only in situations where gratings are being installed or existing gratings renewed.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>It has yet to be shown that even modern turbines can pass small fish without damage. While the fish are not immediately killed, damage to the scales can reduce the survival of the fish. In future, if it can be shown to the satisfaction of fishery interests that certain large turbines can pass small fish without damage it may be possible for the Department to grant exemption under the existing Section 59(4)."</p></blockquote>
The Committee will appreciate that I am interleaving several questions and answers, but the reply went on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"While the clearance of debris from both gratings and meshes may be an onerous task, these are necessary to provide protection to fish, particularly at times of migration. I also note your comments that electric barriers can be used and do not require debris clearance and where these are shown to be effective the Department could exempt the owner of the mill from the requirement to instal gratings under Section 59(4).</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>There is no need to define gratings. A grating can be a framework of parallel or cross bars, but the lesser requirement of only parallel bars is the only requirement either sought by the FCB or enforceable.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Similar appeals provisions as are provided for in Article 15 are now included in this Article."</p></blockquote>
It does not say that parallel bars are the only requirement being sought. Why not? That is what it should say. People have a right to know if parallel bars at a 2.5 mm spacing are the only requirement. There is nothing to prevent an overbearing fishery authority from imposing a requirement for a square mesh. Something to prevent that needs to be written into the order. The notion of gratings on tail races is largely nonsensical. Only small fish pass through the 2 inch bars. Not many sea trout will get through, and no salmon. It is daft to propose that the gaps should be reduced so much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
Research is continuing into the difficult task of constructing gratings. It is also difficult to install and operate electric diverters. Vandals exist in Northern Ireland, and many of the smaller mills are accessible to them. I have suffered from their depredations for years and know all about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for fish passing through turbines, I should like to relate my experience and that of my late father. We ran a straightforward Francis wheel which is quite damaging for fish. Our experience of the tens of thousands of salmon smolts that went down that river was that few were killed in the mill except during periods of extreme drought. They migrate in their thousands at this time of the year, regardless of water-flow conditions. If the water is high, they will just go out over the weir. We discovered that by opening an outlet behing the grating, we lost no fish. As soon as they dropped into the dark hole and saw the light, they went for it and were spewed straight out on to the river without damage. During extreme drought conditions when the mill was not operating efficiently, only a small proportion were killed, but we were not happy about that as we were both keen fishermen. The best way to protect small fish is by overflows and electrical diverters rather than by gratings. I hope that more research on that is being carried out and that more help will be given to people who operate machines to protect fish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has no doubt been told about high heads. The difficulty with small fish going through the capelin runner, which is a machine with a three-bladed propeller, is the explosive change in the water pressure between one side of the turbine and the other. That seems to cause the small fish most damage; they do not seem to get hit often by the capelin runner. I know one chap who ties five-foot long stakes to it without the stakes suffering any damage, because so much water is going through. The explosive change in water pressure is what injures the fish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to be taking so long, but I want to place my comments on the record. On article 15 I mentioned the installation of gratings, which is covered by what I have just said. The Minister will be able to read the record and consider the matter carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The installation of 2.5 mm grating or any other grating at the necessary point will often be impossible. Even if it is possible to install, it will be impossible to keep it free of debris and it will often be a target for vandals or poachers, who pursue their nefarious activities at night.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In most cases a grating close to the mill combined with a spillover is a better solution and easier to protect from vandals and flood damage. If it is possible to fit an electrical diverter that should be more than satisfactory.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Each site is unique and should be treated as such with appropriate exemptions. Where tailraces are short there is no need for a grating and such watercourses often provide a good spawning site."</p></blockquote>
I have often seen salmon there. Poaching gravid fish is much less common than it used to be in Northern Ireland. The dangers to them can be largely ignored as they are fairly safe with a bailiff around. However, heavy penalties should be imposed for poaching gravid fish. Electric diverters should be used earlier in the season to prevent entry to tailraces rather than gratings, which cause a lot of trouble. The term grating needs to be defined, but I have covered that point.

Article 16 in the 1988 order deals with the definition of an otter lath or jack. I welcomed that but said that the omission of any reference to a boat being used for one end of the line should be rectified. The use of a gaff to land fish is well-established and in many areas is widely used because it is cheap and easy to transport. It is also the most practical and effective method of landing large fish when there are difficult bank conditions. It is the only way of getting a brute of a 30-pounder out of the water and we do not get many of them in Northern Ireland. The only objection to its use is the fear that it may be used by poachers, mainly in weirs when salmon are running. That fear is greatly exaggerated, because when fish are moving there are many law-abiding anglers around. If poaching is carried out in drought conditions, a salmon tailer could be used equally well to remove fish illegally and that has not been banned. The use of the gaff should continue
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the Fisheries Conservancy Board and other interested parties have been sounded out. Unfortunately, there is a general consensus that the ban on the use of the gaff should continue. Article 17 refers to a gaff with or without a barb. I thought that the use of a gaff with a barb had been illegal for a long time, so I cannot understand why it is mentioned. The Minister has been badly advised. The gaff is a valuable instrument, not nearly as dangerous as some believe, and its use should continue to remain legal. I hope that the Minister will reconsider the issue and look at ways in which it might be exempted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Referring to article 18, I stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This article does not seem to have been properly thought through as the definition set out will alter depending on the state of the tide".</p></blockquote>
That refers to netting; I believe that the matter has been cleared up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked about the use of cross lines to cover boat-to-boat operations, and that was accommodated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In article 19, there is an attempt to quantify the number of Erne and Lough Neagh freshwater commercial fishermen. Given the kerfuffle about freshwater commercial fishing, the Minister will be glad of any clear definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 20 seems to be an effort to tighten the existing law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 21 is intended to give some protection to coarse fish, and I assume that article 22 covers oysters and mussels. There is no reference to where article 23 will appear in the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 24 is a substantial rewriting of the orginal proposal. I asked about its effect. I said that I welcomed section 170A. I asked, too, about the need for article 25. Article 26 seems to allow entry but not search. The Minister said that that had been covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 27 is welcome, as its intention seems to be to make poaching salmon at sea a costly business. I could not understand the need for and the intention of article 28. I asked the Minister whether there was a defence in article 29 if the person involved was merely passing along a stretch of water under the Department's control to waters not under the control of the Department. Someone who wants to get from A to B does not want to have to leave the river bank and go on a three-mile journey to get back to club water which is 300 yards away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my letter, I welcomed article 30, as cases can, at present, be out of time. I said that I thought that article 31 was a tidying-up proposal, and as I received no reply, I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
assume that I was right. I was curious about article 32 because I wondered whether the proposals would apply to the whole of the Foyle area, especially to the tagging of salmon taken in nets. I asked what discussions had taken place with the Government of the Republic of Ireland in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In respect of schedule 3, I asked why the board, and presumably the Foyle Fisheries Commission, should pay for court certificates of conviction. Who met the cost before and why is the change being made?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I welcome the intention of the order and many specific issues in its original and its much-amended form, I have some grave anxieties, especially about the effect on mill owners. I believe that it is possible to solve the problems and to accommodate the concerns that have been expressed, provided that the powers contained in the order are exercised with sound common sense rather than applied strictly according to the letter. So much is unique to each water mill site, club water and river. The law can operate satisfactorily only if it is applied using common sense. I welcome what is being attempted; I hope that if some of the proposals are subsequently found to be wrong, we shall not be slow to correct them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I shall deal with some of the hon. Gentleman's substantive points and leave the rest to correspondence. He mentioned the abstraction of sand and gravel. The problem that he identified would have to be addressed in drainage legislation. It would be outside this order, which addresses fisheries and the abstraction of sand and gravel from spawning beds. His point was important and my hon. Friend the Member for Wiltshire, North (Mr. Needham) will consider it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioined the Foyle Fisheries Commission and the original Act that set it up. The detailed legislative provisions relating to the Foyle area and contained in the Foyle Fisheries (Northern Ireland) Act 1952. Amendment to those provisions would not come within the scope of the order. He will not mind me saying, since he implied that he might raise the matter on the Adjournment of the House, that I should willingly answer his points on such an occasion. I hope that he is fortunate in the ballot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also talked about pollution costs. The order provides for the recovery of the cost of restocking from the person convicted under the Fisheries (Northern Ireland) Act 1966. The polluter must pay. Any disputes about the cost or the level of restocking will be referred to arbitration. He referred to the liability of the Department of the Environment. As he knows, the Department is covered by Crown exemption and is therefore exempt from the provisions in respect of any pollution from DOE water and sewage treatment works. I understand that the Fisheries Conservancy Board for Northern Ireland and anglers' representatives have met officials of that Department and obtained a reasonable commitment on restocking when damage has been caused to fish stocks. The hon. Gentleman gave an example of that. As long as there is good will on both sides, we should be able to deal with the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before going into the detail of the order, the hon. Gentleman mentioned sea trout. I have examined the evidence and do not accept that stocks of sea trout in Northern Ireland have declined significantly, but we must keep the matter under review. Sufficient powers exist already to facilitate necessary action. Any information from the hon. Gentleman would be most welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is vital that commercial ventures can avail themselves of article 4. The provisions are available to anyone, including angling clubs and commercial enterprises which want to develop waters for public angling, provided that the required criteria are met. I assure the hon. Gentleman of our good will in that respect.

The hon. Gentleman then referred to the issue of discretionary or complimentary permits to people outside Northern Ireland. As those are for people outside Northern Ireland, I regret that the hon. Gentleman will not qualify. As he is one of our best customers, so it would deplete
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
greatly our reserves if he were to receive a complimentary licence. Such permits will be issued sparingly. We shall consider one for Lord Mason, who is a great ambassador for the sport in Northern Ireland. However, they are intended mainly for visiting journalists to cover prestigious fishing competitions and for competitors when the event involves promoting angling in Northern Ireland. We have considered recently an application from disabled anglers. If the hon. Gentleman can appoint Lord Mason to	<i>The House Magazine</i>as angling correspondent, we shall see what we can do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that also apply to the Foyle Fisheries Commission area?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall write to the hon. Gentleman about that. The impact of the order on the Foyle Fisheries Commission area is limited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Towards the end of his contribution the hon. Gentleman returned to the tagging issue. There are no general plans to introduce a tagging scheme. The provision will allow the Fisheries Conservancy Board to introduce a limited tagging scheme, if it considers that worth while. However, that could be done only for salmon landed in its area. Much greater powers would be required to encompass the whole of Northern Ireland. I agree that a tagging scheme must operate in the whole island of Ireland to be effective. Salmon do not respect borders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to the banning of lures. Those lures are controlled by the Fisheries Conservancy Board byelaws. That board represents many views, including those of anglers. I hope that anglers will voice their worries when the board considers introducing an amendment byelaw in the case to which the hon. Gentleman referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned many points regarding mill owners that should be clarified. Such clarification requires great consideration by my Department and we shall reply to the hon. Gentleman in due course. I shall ensure that a copy of the letter is placed in the Library.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That covers most of the major points that the hon. Gentleman made. The order is important and will regulate more effectively salmon and inland fisheries in Northern Ireland. It would not have been so important or as effective without the contribution of the hon. Gentleman, and the Committee and the whole House are in his debt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
