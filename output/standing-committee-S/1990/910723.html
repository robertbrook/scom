	<div class='legislation'>Draft Social Security (Severe Disablement Allowance) Amendment Regulations 1991</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Social Security and Disabled People (Mr. Nicholas Scott)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Social Security (Severe Disablement Allowance) Amendment Regulations 1991.</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the agreement of the Committee, it will be convenient to discuss the other order before us, namely, the draft Disability Living Allowance Advisory Board Regulations 1991.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that hon. Members would not wish me to detain them for too long, as a lot of the ground was covered during discussions on the Disability Living Allowance and Disability Working Allowance Act 1991. As a result of those debates, I believe that there is wide understanding of the underlying purpose of the regulations. Nevertheless, I shall say a few words about each of the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The severe disablement allowance amendment regulations primarily give effect to the Government's commitment to modifying the residence qualifying condition for severe disablement allowance for serving members of the armed forces and their close families. That commitment was given in the other place by my noble Friend the Lord Henley on 7 March. The regulations also bring forward some purely technical amendments which introduce no changes in policy but which are needed to clarify earlier drafting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will be aware that SDA has a residence condition of 10 years in 20. We recognise that that rule has presented difficulties for some people, including a few families of serving members of the forces who may qualify for the allowance simply because they belong to the family of someone who is required to be abroad in the armed forces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is only right that in this case the social security benefits system should recognise the exceptional position of service men and women. Special rules already exist to help members of the forces and their families with the presence conditions that apply to non-contributory benefits for sick or disabled people. We are simply extending those special rules to the residence condition for severe disablement allowance. The draft regulations put the position of that group beyond doubt, providing that periods abroad as serving members of the armed forces or part of the close family shall count as residence in Great Britain for the purposes of the SDA qualifying conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
The draft Disability Living Allowance Advisory Board Regulations need to be viewed in the context of the radical new approach that we are taking to the adjudication and assessment of disability living allowance and attendance allowance. That approach, which has been widely welcomed, means that in future all decisions will be taken by adjudication officers—in the majority of cases, on the basis of self-assessment rather than medical examination. Therefore, the attendance allowance board—to whose considerable efforts over the years I pay warm tribute—will be abolished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, adjudication officers will clearly need advice and support to understand some of the terminology and evidence with which they are likely to be confronted; that is where the new disability living allowance advisory board will be able to help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main and immediate function of the board will be to advise on a new disability handbook for adjudication officers and others working on attendance allowance and disability living allowance. The board's role in advising on the handbook is one of the main reasons for troubling the Committee with the regulations just before the recess—I apologise for the inconvenience. The training of adjudication officers is due to start later this year and the handbook will be a key element in that training. The new board needs to be up and running within a month or two so that the members can make a meaningful contribution to the handbook in good time before training starts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The handbook will help adjudication officers to understand the needs that are likely to arise as a result of a number of disabling conditions. It will enable adjudication officers to interpret the evidence from the self-assessment claim forms completed by customers and the supporting statements from those who are treating them or caring for them—without having to seek further medical advice or asking for a medical examination. In very exceptional cases—for example, where there is a doubt about the care or mobility needs of a new medical condition—the board will be able to provide expert advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Board will not be concerned solely with medical matters. The regulations for the new board reflect the emphasis throughout the adjudication system on needs rather than on specific medical conditions and are very explicit in requiring that there should be members with experience of other caring professions such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy, nursing, and social work. Moreover, hon. Members who sat on the Committee that considered the Disability Living Allowance and Disability Working Allowance Bill will recall that strong representations were made that disabled people should play a major role on the board. I hope that all hon. Members will acknowledge that our stipulation that at least six members of the board—half the minimum membership—should be people with disabilities, and that at least one member must be a carer, shows the seriousness with which we responded to those representations and made changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am convinced that the board as constituted under these regulations will make a significant contribution to the success of the new adjudication arrangements

for disability living allowance and attendance allowance. I therefore commend both sets of regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.35 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Allen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What a pleasure it is, Sir Anthony, to see you in the Chair this morning. I thank all hon. Members and members of staff who are present despite having been up all night dealing with the business of the House. I hope that hon. Members will bear last night in mind when they fill out their questionnaires from the Select Committee that is considering the hours of sittings of the House. That experience may influence their judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to deal first with the order on severe disablement allowance. I shall make some general points to which the Minister of State may wish to reply but I shall begin with a couple of specific questions. We welcome the concessions for members of the armed forces—a number of military-minded hon. Members are present who, no doubt, welcome the concessions, too. They may also care to ask what has happened in the past. Will some sort of reparations be made—to use a military term—for those people who have not benefited as their colleagues may benefit in the future, especially those in the armed forces and those eligible for the age-related additions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If these measures correct a problem that was apparent in the initial drafting, it would be helpful if the Minister could tell us what has happened with regard to the people who have not benefited. Were extra statutory payments involved, and will there be any retrospection in respect of the people who will now benefit from the change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the general situation it is odd that some people can qualify in a relatively short period and that other people can qualify only over a long period. I am grateful for the Minister's response to a parliamentary question on 16 July; it could be helpful in forming the basis of a dialogue with the Minister. I asked him what review he had undertaken of the different residency rules for severe disablement allowance compared with other benefits, such as attendance allowance, mobility allowance or disability living allowance. I asked further whether he planned to review the apparent inconsistency. His reply was, as always, quite helpful—as we expect from the Minister—but it contained some tantalising lines—that is quite unusual in a parliamentary answer, as you well know, Sir Anthony—that he may care to develop this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister rightly recognised the criticism made of the length of the period of residency—one of the qualifying conditions for severe disablement allowance—because it is more stringent than for other noncontributoary benefits for sick and disabled people. He referred to the fact that the European Court of Justice was considering the matter. He believed that it would be sensible to be informed of its view before reaching a conclusion on the test for claimants in general.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State may care to comment on the likelihood of the judgment coming forward in the not too distant future and on how he would continue the review, taking it on to claimants in general rather than
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
those currently before the European Court of Justice. He said that we should discuss the matter today and believed that the approach was wholly justified in advance of a more general consideration of the test. Therefore, there is the possibility and prospect of a more general consideration. We should welcome that, as, I suspect, would a good number of the Minister's hon. Friends. The Minister may care to allude to that point a little later on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current rules for severe disablement allowance require the claimant to have been resident in Great Britain for 24 of the last 28 weeks and to have been resident in Great Britain for 10 of the last 20 years. The regulations before us today propose to waive that residence condition for members of the armed forces and their families, not least because of representations made during the passage of the Disability Living Allowance and Disability Working Allowance Bill in 1991. Several outside bodies believe that the condition should be withdrawn entirely for all claimants. There is no parallel rule for other disability benefits, and it seems illogical and unjust to retain such a stringent rule for that benefit alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These regulations move in that direction. In a sense, they set a precedent which I hope the Minister of State will build upon to ensure that the rules become consistent for all types of claimants and claims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Severe disablement allowance plays a crucial role in providing a basic income for severely disabled people who have either been unable to work because of their disability or, as with many married women, have paid the lower married women's insurance contribution or have not worked outside the home because of caring responsibilities. It is a non-means-tested benefit, providing a substitute for earnings when someone is severely disabled, unable to work and has not paid enough national insurance contributions to qualify for invalidity benefit—the insurance-based benefit for long-term sick people. It is paid at a much lower rate than invalidity benefit; the basic allowance is a mere £31.25 per week, with possible age-related additions of £3.45, £6.90 or £11.10, depending on the age at which a person first qualifies. As a result of that low benefit level, many people who receive SDA are forced to rely on a means-tested top-up from income support to have enough to live on. In 1990, about 284,600 people received severe disablement allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the outside bodies that made representations about the regulation argued in the past that the only relevant factor in determining entitlement for disability benefits should be the degree of disability and its cost; there should be no differentiation between disabled people on grounds of work or insurance record, income, age, sex, race or how a disability was incurred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present system permits disabled people who have identical disabilities and identical costs of disability to claim very differing amounts of benefit, depending on the cause of disability. I hope that all hon. Members present will agree that that is an inconsistency and, although we cannot correct it in this Committee, the Minister of State may care to take it away and re-examine it yet again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Social Security Advisory Comittee stated:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0171">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
	<br><q><p>"the social security system should provide an adequate basic income for all disabled people who cannot support themselves fully, with parity of income between all groups".</p></q>
It is fundamental that the residency test should be reviewed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a 10-year residence test. As was highlighted in reply to my parliamentary question, no other benefit requires anything like that period of residence. Other examples are six months for attendance allowance and invalid care allowance, and one year for mobility allowance. It may be argued that they are strong residence tests, but 10 years for this benefit is irrational. I hope that the Minister will look at that again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 10-year residence test discriminates against people who have the right of settlement in Great Britain and may be British citizens. It can be seen also as giving a message to black and ethnic minority communities that their severely disabled members are given less priority that white British people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should also be borne in mind that someone who has lived here for many years can be caught by this provision if they go abroad for an extended stay—I repeat the welcome that I have given to the measure for people who are in the armed forces. However, I shall illustrate my point with a civilian example from the CAB in west Yorkshire. It reported the case of a 54year-old Asian woman who had a kidney transplant in 1987 and was awarded mobility allowance for five years from August 1988. She has to rely on her husband and three daughters for assistance. She was resident in the United Kingdom from 1980 but went abroad for 18 months in 1982. Therefore she will have to wait until 1992 before she qualifies for severe disablement allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the Government's obsession with public expenditure and resources, we need to look carefully at how much any change will cost. However, if we look at the SDA, there are only a limited number of people who are excluded by this 10-year residency rule. If that rule were alleviated to some extent, the cost would be relatively small given the Department's budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the longer term, many of the interest groups believe that the SDA should be upgraded to invalidity benefit, its non-contributory equivalent. The current rate of IVB is £52 a week, with £31.25 paid for an adult dependant. The current rate of SDA is £31.25, with £18.70 for an adult dependant. The Government have now partially recognised that the SDA should be raised to the level of IVB by introducing age-related additions to the SDA in the Social Security Act 1989. Again, I concur with the SSAC, which stated:
	<br><q><p>"We recommend that the rates of SDA are raised progressively until they are equal to IVB rates."</p></q>
Perhaps the Minister will tell us what the Goverment are planning in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have many reservations about the Disability Living Allowance Advisory Board. My general point is that creating a new advisory board provided many opportunities, but they have been missed. I hope that it is not too late for the Government to take on board one or two of the points that I am about to make to enhance the effectiveness of the administration of benefits.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
Despite the Minister's great experience and sensitivity in this area, he and his colleagues—and the same applies to all of us—would benefit immensely from independent advice. In many ways we have missed the boat with this advisory board by not giving it the independence that perhaps it should have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the difficulties is reconciling the general move towards a more non-medical-oriented assessment and, perhaps, the desire of people who have always lived in that framework to retain a medical-oriented assessment. That is evident from the way in which the board is to be created because, if that is considered alongside the medical handbook, there seems to be a feeling of fear coming from the Department about the possibilities of the demedicalisation of decision making on attendance allowance, mobility allowance and disability living allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although decisions will be made by lay adjudication officers, the Department is clearly showing its wish to maintain some sort of control and influence over the general medical information available to those adjudication officers. That wish appears so strong that the Department and the Ministers do not even want general medical information to be given by an independent body. Unlike the attendance allowance board, the DLAAB will have no decision making powers and no real independence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth considering the regulations in some detail. I wonder whether the right sorts of people will be prepared to give up their time to serve on the board, given its lack of power and independence. I hope that I am wrong about that, but many people might say that they cannot take up issues that they feel are important and advise the Ministers and the Department either on a confidential or a public basis and so ask, "Why the heck do we turn up to the board's meetings?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I am wrong about that, as those who have served in the past on such boards, which have had a few more teeth, have done great public service, as the Minister said. I hope that they will continue to do so. However, those on the board should be offered more job satisfaction than is apparent in the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under section 3(2) of the Act, there is no clear remit for the DLAAB, other than that its functions must relate to DLA or attendance allowance. All is left to regulations. It is clear that the DLAAB's role is reduced and that it is a lesser version of the attendance allowance board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government missed an opportunity to introduce the equivalent of the Social Security Advisory Committee or the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council to concentrate solely on disability living allowance issues. Part of the board's remit could be to consider methods of developng the DLA into something similar to the costs allowance proposed in the comprehensive disability incomes scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The terms of reference of the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council contained in section 141 of the Social Security Act 1975 state that the council may advise the Secretary of State on any other matter relating to industrial injury benefit or its administration. The terms of reference for the Social Security Advisory
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0172">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
Committee contained in section 9(1)(a) of the Social Security Act 1980 state:
	<br><q><p>"to give (whether in pursuance of a reference under this Act or otherwise) advice and assistance to the Secretary of State in connection with the discharge of his functions under the relevant enactments."</p></q>
In plain English, that means that both bodies have the power and discretion to examine issues that they feel are serious and important in their given specialisations and to proffer advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Industrial Injuries Advisory Council or the SSAC do not give binding instructions—sometimes I wish that they did—but they are allowed to put forward their views. That is their great strength. It is a weakness not to allow such a general power and discretion to the DLAAB. It is almost a political weakness; it is a fear that what the DLAAB might say would somehow embarrass or compromise the Government. I trust that that is not the case and hope that, when the Secretary of State uses his discretion, he will do so widely and make some sense of the remit and give the board a general power to intervene. In other words, he should let the board off the hook that this restrictive set of regulations would provide. His first specific guidance to the board on day one should offer a wide remit. That would be one way round the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 2 sets out the DLAAB's functions and powers. As I said, it is in no sense an independent body. Regulations do not provide for the board to have any general direct advice or information role. It cannot even decide for itself to work on certain common issues arising from DLA or attendance allowance. It has, therefore, no effective power to act independently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The board is, however, empowered to present an annual report to the Secretary of State. My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Staffordshire (Mrs. Heal) was a member of the Standing Committee that examined the Bill, and she can report to us better than I can; I merely scanned the report of the Committee's proceedings. I see that there was a brief debate on the powers of the Secretary of State to receive a report from the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the caveat does, because of the discretion allowed to Ministers and to the Department, is to allow the Government to say, "Right, we have a report from the Secretary of State. What are we going to do with it?" At present, it is not clear from the regulations; the Secretary of State may choose to publish the report at an early stage, or to put it out for consultation. He could decide to put the report formally to the Social Services Select Committee, or to lay it before Parliament. There is a range of possibilities, and none is specified in the regulations. At present, it appears that the Secretary of State may sit on the report, rather than take it seriously and put it before a wider forum. We would be happy if the report could be freely and publicly available in Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many reports now—not only those on consumer affairs, the citizen's charter and all the rest—such as the Departmental annual reports which are part of the move towards management by objectives. They contribute to the number of documents that float around Whitehall and could be part of a serious effort towards parliamentary accountability. This might be just one part of that process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
Can the Minister say what plans the Secretary of State has for the board's annual reports when he receives them?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under regulation 2(1)(b), the DLAAB's role in adjudication is to give advice to the DSS doctors on individual cases that have been specifically referred to it, whereas the attendance allowance board at least could make general directions under paragraph 5 of schedule 11 to the Social Security Act 1975.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The DLAAB's independent powers to give general advice, to comment on the efficacy of medical report forms and self-assessment forms, and to carry out general research on medical issues arising from them are non-existent. Where the board finds a serious problem arising only from a case that has been referred to it by the Secretary of State, it should be able to say, "We're on to something here; we can help the individual claimant and also help the Government and the Department." But as the regulations are drafted the board cannot say even that, or draw the general conclusion from the specific case. The board's hands are tied, even where it sees something that with its members' expertise has been glaringly obvious, although it may not have been to those hon. Members who processed the Bills through Committee or to the Government who administer the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Instead, under regulation 2(1)(a), the DLAAB is required
	<br><q><p>"to give advice to the Secretary of State on such matters as he may refer to them for consideration."</p></q>
Will the Minister make clear what matters the Secretary of State will refer to the board, other than his referring to the broad remit that such matters must relate to attendance allowance or DLA? It would be possible with the first move that the Secretary of State makes in respect of the board to set it free and give it that general remit under his first direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations are also silent on what can or will be done with the board's advice. Clearly, any publication of that advice will be mediated through the Department—for example, the medical handbook that was produced in draft before the establishment of the board. Given that the DLAAB has no independent powers, it is clear that, when there is a dispute, the views of the DSS's own medical practitioners must prevail. Therefore, at the very least, the regulations should give the DLAAB the capacity to act independently of the Secretary of State and of individual requests for advice from the DSS's medical practitioners under section 115C(4) of the Social Security Act 1975.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that we cannot change the regulations at this late stage to give the DLAAB the capacity to act independently of the Secretary of State and of individual requests. None the less, can the Minister say whether the Secretary of State, in his early dealings with the board, will give it the freedom to operate in his first direction, which is not included in the regulations? I look forward to hearing the right hon. Gentleman's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

that it would be introduced. A small number of cases are involved in the matter but, as my right hon. Friend the Minister of State knows, the issue was drawn attention to by a campaign organised last year by Ann Armstrong of 	<i>Soldier</i> magazine in which she highlighted an especially bad case. Indeed, she and I had extensive correspondence about it; she also discussed it with my hon. Friend the former Under-Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to pay tribute to our noble friend, Lord Swinfen, who campaigned vigorously on the matter in the House of Lords. I am glad that the Government decided to make such adjustments. Unfortunately, there is no concession of any type that a Government can make when someone does not leap up and say that there are a million other concessions that could be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to leave my right hon. Friend with one thought to which I do not expect a response today. I refer to a strange anomaly of which the measure forms part. Service families abroad are expected, if they are employed, to participate fully in national insurance contributions and to adopt them as though they were resident in this country, yet they do not participate fully in the benefits of their national insurance fund. That is one example of what is being put right today; another is unemployment benefit. However, it would be churlish of me if I were to dwell on that point when my right hon. Friend introduced such a sound measure, for which I thank him. I look forward to hearing his response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.3 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal briefly with the issues that have been raised. I wish first to make it clear that in no sense will the changes be retrospective. I doubt whether that will come as a surprise to the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen). However, people will benefit from the new rules once the regulations are enforced. Naturally, I am conscious of the pressure for broader changes from outside organisations. I shall clarify the present position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the hon. Member for Nottingham, North found my parliamentary answer helpful. At present, Belgium's residence qualifications are being challenged in the European Court of Justice. The Committee may be interested to know that the period of residential qualifications in Belgium is five years. It is important for us to await the resolution of that case before deciding on any wider changes in residence qualifications. I understand the pressure and the validity of the arguments. However, I am unable to tell the Committee the timing of the case. The European Court of Justice is unpredictable, but obviously the sooner it can be cleared up, the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also referred to the desirability of aligning SDA with IVB. I have taken note of that and have responded to those pressures in other discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman, in passing, mentioned the difference between the residence qualifications for attendance allowance and mobility allowance—six months out of the last 12 for attendance allowance and 12 months out of the last 18 for mobility allowance.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
When we move to DLA next April, the residence qualification will be harmonised on the lower benchmark that applies to attendance allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to a particular case. I shall have to consider it in detail, but he seemed to imply that the Asian lady left this country for two years and the clock had to start again when she returned. It did not; the requirement is 10 years in the last 20 years. Therefore, any years that she had clocked up before she left would count towards the 10 years, as long as they were within the 20-year parameter. I hope that that will be helpful to the hon. Gentleman's understanding of this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) for welcoming the changes. I have noted the less happy point that he raised and shall give it some thought. I am delighted that he has recognised the importance of this measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the DLAAB regulations, it is vital that when lay adjudication officers make decisions they have proper and authoritative medical guidance. Otherwise, we would be back to the same old business of having to have medical examinations and tests. The thrust of demedicalisation—which I understood during discussions was welcome across the Committee—would be put at risk. The immediate task of the DLAAB will be to work on the handbook. We have sent out draft copies to a wide range of disability organisations, which will give their views on its contents. The fact that we have sent out the handbook for widespread consultation of the organisations of and for disabled people has received a positive response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The board will not be short of work. The hon. Gentleman implied that it would not be a worthwhile body on which to invite people to sit. Although it will have no adjudication role—I understood that that was common ground in the Committee and that it welcomed the fact that the board would not have that role in future—it will play an important role when new medical conditions arise: It will advise adjudication officers on the impact of those conditions on people's lives. Difficult cases may arise from time to time where it would be right for the adjudication authorities to ask the DLAAB to advise on the impact on people's lives and on the medical aspects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The board will have the overall job of monitoring the working of the new system. It will be able, in its annual report, to make observations on the general running of the new system. It will be engaged in widespread consultation I look to the board to have an open door so that those who are concerned and interested in these matters will be able to talk to the board and give their advice. We envisage that the report will not be sat on by the Secretary of State but will be published and be a matter of public discussion and open for any Select Committee to make its observations and take evidence about the operation of the new system. I am anxious not simply to re-invent the old attendance allowance board, as the hon. Gentleman seemed to suggest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to put the hon. Gentleman's mind at rest on another matter. Already a considerable number of people with expertise in disablement have expressed an interest in being on the new board, including some
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0174">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
with professional interests. The Secretary of State and I will have a difficult task in selecting from so many well-qualified people those who are to be appointed to the board in the first instance There will be plenty of rewarding work to be done in the interests of those people in our community with disabilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that we have got it right. Of course, as in anything in this world, we shall be monitoring those changes carefully and keeping them under review. I commend the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I press the Minister a little further on the board's remit? He said that the Secretary of State would be generous in the terms of references that he made to the board. Doubtless, such references could include looking at the generality as well as at specific cases, which we would welcome. However, if that is so, why can it not appear in the Act or the regulations before us? Why is it omitted here when it was not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
