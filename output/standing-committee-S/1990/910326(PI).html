	<div class='legislation'>DRAFT PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT (INCREASE OF LIMIT) ORDER 1991</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for the Arts (Mr. Tim Renton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Public Lending Right (Increase of Limit) Order 1991</p></q>
This will probably prove to be an uncontroversial measure. I am sure that hon. Members agree that the public lending right is intrinsically a good concept as a means of rewarding and encouraging authors whose books are lent by public libraries and of encouraging reading. The registrar's research has shown that PLR helps a wide range of authors—more than 14,000—and that that help does not go merely to household names.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted that you, Mr. Howells, is in the Chair because as a Welshman you are well known for your interest in language and culture. Several members of the Committee are interested in writing and either are authors or putative authors. I am delighted to see from "Dod's" that my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) and my Parliamentary Private Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich (Mr. Bowden), describe their recreation as reading. Given the Trappist nature of their jobs, it is particularly suitable that that should be so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a collateral interest to declare—I hope that members of the Committee will not mention it—because this week celebrates the publication of my wife's second book.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Fisher 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Get it on the record—publisher and price!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will gladly give the information to the hon. Gentleman afterwards. Although she did not register her first book for PLR, because of the anticipated success of her second one she intends to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Public Lending Right Act 1979, an increase in the fund requires an order in a statutory instrument to be laid before and approved by resolution of the House before the start of the financial year in which it is to take place. The order authorises a considerable increase in the fund of 36 per cent., from £3.5 million in this financial year to £4.75 million for the financial year to 1991–92.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rupert Allason 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torbay)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What proportion of that money will go to authors and what will be spent on administration?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The best I can do is refer my hon. Friend, who, as an author, has a substantial interest in this matter, to the annual comparisons produced by the PLR registrar in January, which showed that for the year to February 1991, from total Government funding of £3.5 million, just over £500,000 was spent on operating costs. I shall refer later to the additional computer costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
There are two reasons for the increase from £3.5 million to £4.75 million. First, since the last substantial increase in 1988–89, the value of the fund and the rate per loan have fallen in real terms. It is right to increase the fund to counteract that and to take account of the increase in the number of registered interests. That is in line with Government policy to increase the fund from time to time to ensure that its real value is maintained. Secondly—this deals with the point made by hon. Friend the Member for Torbay (Mr. Allason) —the computer on which the PLR operation is dependent has reached the end of its useful life and must be replaced. The major portion of the cost will fall on the fund in 1991–92 and the remainder in 1992–93, but the estimates that I have received from the registrar show that, despite those computer costs, the increase proposed will more than restore the real value of the rate per loan to its 1983–84 value and maintain it through 1992–93.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have announced their intention to increase the fund to £5 million for 1993–94. I am sure that that demonstrates our continuing commitment to the public lending right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the last increase of limit order in 1988, and following consultation with interested parties, several important changes have been made to the public lending right scheme, including an increase in the number of sample libraries from 20 to 30, the extension of eligibility to include posthumous editions and the increase of the maximum limit from £5,000 to £6,000. Thanks to improved technology, the new computer that is being installed will allow a larger loan sample, including the facility to sample all libraries within a given authority, and thus achieve more accurate estimates at minimal extra cost. It will achieve greater value, flexibility and, I hope, value for money in the long term. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Torbay, I keenly wish to keep down the operating and administrative costs as much as possible and to ensure that they are a small percentage of the total sum available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures produced by the registrar in January show that in the year to February 1991 three new maxima were reached—the number of registered authors under the scheme, in its eighth year of operation, was its highest ever at just under 19,000; the registered book interests were also the highest ever at 168,587; and total recipients —the total number of authors earning—was the highest ever at 15,471, compared with the previous year's figure, which was a new peak, of 14,200. That shows the extent to which the PLR scheme is succeeding and that it is being used by an increasingly wide range of authors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the last order, and at the suggestion of the registrar, the Advisory Committee on Public Lending Right has been reconstituted as a committee advising the registrar and myself, as Minister for the Arts, under an independent chairman, David Whitaker. I should like to pay tribute to the work of the committee and particularly—I am sure that members of the Committee will agree with this —to the outstanding work of the first Registrar of Public Lending Right, John Sumsion, who retires later this year. I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.38 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Fisher 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join the Minister in paying tribute to John Sumsion, who, as the right hon. Gentleman said, is retiring this August having been registrar from the outset of the scheme. Authors throughout the country, and indeed in the House, owe him
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0368">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
considerable thanks. It is appropriate that as we debate the order Mr. Sumsion is at Buckingham Palace receiving the OBE that he was awarded in the new year's honours list. There could not be a more fitting tribute to his superb work. I am glad that he will not be lost to the world of books because I understand that he will help Loughborough university with its statistics, which is an important aspect of its library work. In addition, we should thank Maureen Duffy and Brigid Brophy, who exerted pressure for the introduction of PLR. Mr. Sumsion has been a model servant in realising those aspirations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour Members recognise and welcome the increase made by the order. Throughout the 1980s, the PLR was not increased so it is a pleasure to be able to compliment the Minister and say that it is fortunate and to his credit that in his first year as Minister for the Arts he has been able to increase it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee will be pleased with that, but before they are too pleased one or two points should be made. In answer to the hon. Member for Torbay (Mr. Allason), the Minister candidly recognised that not all the increase will go to writers because of the need to replace the computer, which is almost nine years old. It would be helpful if the Minister gave more information on the computer. Obviously, bids are subject to EC regulations on competitive tendering and the Minister cannot know the exact cost, but he could say when it will be up and running and what it will be able to do that the existing computer cannot. Will it be able to cope with trends and what assistance will that offer the administration of the scheme, and will it provide opportunities for reciprocal PLR with other countries? As international co-operation is high on the agenda of the EC, which is considering a draft directive, the capacity of the computer is important. I should be glad if the Minister responded to that and to the point made by the hon. Member for Torbay on whether the computer will reduce administrative costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Administrative costs are approximately 14 per cent., which is not to the discredit of Mr. Sumsion and his staff, who do a good job, but more to the complexity of the scheme. However, 14 per cent. in any area of public life is a high figure. Even if administrative costs were at the current level—about £500,000—the increase would reduce them to only 11 per cent., which still is a high administrative cost. It would be interesting to know whether the computer offers an opportunity to reduce those costs and, if so, how it would do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the cost of the computer is deducted from the increase, the 36 per cent. which the Minister understandably trumpeted becomes a smaller sum for the benefit of authors, whom the scheme is meant to benefit. It is important to place that on record and to recognise that, compared with our gross national product and population, the scheme is, for all its many excellences, the worst funded in the world. Comparable schemes in Scandinavia and Germany are better funded although some of them have wider responsibilities for writers' pensions. Before we congratulate ourselves too much, it is important to put the scheme in international perspective. We have a long way to go before we can say that it contributes not only to our symbolic thanks to authors and recognition of their value to our culture but offers recognition in some more tangible form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
The Minister said that the order is important not necessarily for the financial rewards that it brings but because it is a endorsement of Government's and society's appreciation of literature. He candidly recognised that 60 per cent. of authors who benefit from the scheme receive less than £100. They probably share the Minister's view that the order is important not necessarily for its financial rewards but more for its symbolic value and recognition. If we are to progress the scheme by the end of the century, we must recognise, without criticising the Government unduly, that we have a long way to go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister consider, in the next few months that he is in post, the position of reference works? When the scheme was set up, they were excluded from it, but he will know that other countries, such as Sweden and the Netherlands, include some categories of reference work, which is an important part of library provision. We should be proud of the work of people who contribute to reference books. Will the Minister at least consider a pilot scheme on whether reference works can be brought within the parameters of the scheme? Hon. Members were reluctant to ask for that when the scheme was underfunded, but as it has been increased we can consider more positively the role of reference works.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was interesting to hear the Minister's direct interest in his wife's book. I do not know whether he was encouraging us to buy her book—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But she would not benefit from the scheme. We must be encouraged to borrow her book from libraries to improve her score in the scheme. The Minister recognises that the royalties that will accrue to her through purchase are rather larger than the 1.37p per loan under the scheme. I wish the right hon. Gentleman's wife extremely well with her book, but he missed an opportunity to put its title on record. I look forward to receiving it later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have an interest to declare, because I wrote a book a couple of years ago with three other people. Under the rule of three in the PLR guidelines, we may not apply for benefit, yet the book is heavily borrowed; it has gone into a second education and is a set book in a number of courses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allason</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that if he could persuade some of his co-authors to drop out he could register?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting point but I should not wish them to do so. They are suitably proud of their contribution to the book, which was very much a cooperative effort. I take the point, but I should not wish to squeeze them off the title page, which would be necessary because of the fairly strict guidelines on the irregular title page requirements of the PLR. Perhaps the Minister will consider that, although of my three points the one on reference is much the most substantial and most constructive way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is not the increase an opportunity to include school libraries, which are an important part of our public library provision? People who write for children and to excite the next generation about literature are at the heart of any strategy to encourage good quality writing in our society, which must be the purpose of the scheme. It is wrong that school libraries are not included. The Minister may say that school libraries are not a statutory responsibility on local education authorities, although almost every authority has
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0369">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
a school library service, but a pilot scheme could explore the possible inclusion of the school and reference library service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's predecessor, the right hon. Member for Shoreham (Sir R. Luce), put PLR on the cultural agenda when Britain last had the presidency of the EC, but no progress seems to have been made since. Have the Government responded to the proposed EC directive? Will the Minister give us his interim view, and if not will he say when the Government will comment on it? Members of the Committee will recognise that although we play such a major international role and export books all over the world—we have a balance of trade in our favour of about £700 million a year in publishing—unnecessary obstacles are being put in the way of British authors because the scheme is not international. We must enthusiastically endorse the spirit of the EC directive, which would benefit us rather more that Scandinavian or Dutch authors. We obviously need an international forum for that, but if copyright is rightly seen as a key international issue, then the public lending right and its benefits to authors should be seen in the same light. I hope that the Minister will enthusiastically consider the proposed EC directive and agree that it is a way forward for Government policy on literature and that it will benefit authors, which is the purpose of the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted that the Minister has been able to make the increase. I recognise that there will be an extra £250,000 next year—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The year after next.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The year after next. We shall once again be slipping behind inflation and will need to consider it enthusiastically. In the meantime, the order gives us an opportunity to progress on the one or two key areas that I have mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.51 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rupert Allason 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torbay)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this important issue and I am pleased that my right hon. Friend the Minister is here to answer a few questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to declare an interest as a PLR recipient and author. It is widely believed by VAT inspectors—most successful authors are VAT registered—that VAT is payable on PLR, but it is not. Every two years, authors must go through the ridiculous rigmarole of arranging for letters to be sent to Mr. Sumsion. It would be worthwhile if a message could be sent to the VAT authorities to inform them that VAT is not payable on PLR.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned about bureaucracy. Mr. Sumsion has greatly improved matters at PLR headquarters, but the original forms were a disgrace. They are still far too complicated and should be simplified. Many authors believe that PLR headquarters is bureaucracy gone mad. Every time one registers a new title, one receives a print-out of one's entire listing, which is quite unnecessary and very wasteful. The registration procedure is complicated and I am pleased that it has been simplified. Nevertheless, it remains a lengthy process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why must authors register by June to receive PLR funds for the following year? A six-month lead time is quite unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
I am pleased by the increase in the number of libraries linked to the scheme from 20 to 30—that is certainly an improvement—but one difficulty is that because of the restriction to public lending libraries there is undue weighting to fiction. The suggestion of the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) about linking the school library scheme would help authors who concentrate on non-fiction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister will tell us what a posthumous edition is. He rather skated over that, but I wondered whether it should be in the clairvoyancy department and how one gets an edition published posthumously and receives funds for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the comments that the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central made on European integration. Authors receive a small income from Germany through a private scheme to which one must subscribe separately. With 1992 in mind, it would be worthwhile if PLR were linked to other European systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for the increase in funding to £4.75 million, but my right hon. Friend the Minister is too sanguine about the cost of the computer. I believe that the computer does much unnecessary work. It is disappointing that it should have to be replaced quite so quickly.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. John G. Blackburn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dudley, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make a couple of brief comments which I am sure, with any gift of prophecy that I have, will bring delight to your heart, Mr. Howells.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wrote a reference book in 1984 that was not subject to PLR. I want to mention two other issues to which I hope my right hon. Friend the Minister will respond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A 73-year-old retired Welsh cleric, Rev. W. D. Awdry, wrote books. It is sad beyond words that my local authority has decided to ban his books from schools and libraries. For those who do not understand his writings, he is the author of "Thomas the Tank Engine", but because of the sexist nature of the railway engines they have been banned from the children of Dudley. I have three adorable grandchildren who secretly read "Thomas the Tank Engine" at home. A retired Welsh cleric of 73, who in my judgment, which is not shared, has given so much to the concept of children's reading and literature should not be treated in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second thing will again delight you, Mr. Howells:
	<br><q><p>"Every morning when I wake,</p></q>
	<br><q><p>Dear Lord a little prayer I make,</p></q>
	<br><q><p>Oh please to keep Thy watchful eye</p></q>
	<br><q><p>On all poor creatures born to die",</p></q>
which of course is the wonderful writing of Dylan Thomas in "Under Milk Wood". A member of the other place is a trustee of the fund for Dylan Thomas's relatives. It would be nice to know that the wonderful writings of Dylan Thomas will, in some small measure, ease the burden on his family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I have an assurance or an explanation of the posthumous aspect of the order, which was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Torbay (Mr. Allason)? With a full heart, I commend the order to the Committee; it has my full and unqualified support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an extremely interesting debate, not least the serious comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, West (Dr. Blackburn) on the reasons why "Thomas the Tank Engine" is barred from bookshelves, public libraries and schools in Dudley, West. The same comment could be made about Babar the Elephant —a male elephant who is happily married with children. This is a serious subject, and perhaps my hon. Friend will table a question so that my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Science can consider it. Under the Public Libraries and Museums Act 1964, I have only a general duty for public libraries but I am pleases that he raised the matter. I hope that the library authorities and school libraries in Dudley will take his comments carefully to mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) for expressing his support for the order and for the increase. As he recognised, the order for the new computer is out to tender. It would not be right to give, therefore, too close an estimate of what we think it will cost because that might encourage tenderers to increase the price beyond what they would otherwise bid, but I am advised that the cost will be split between two financial years—1991–92 and 1992–93—and on our best estimates, which are dependent on the final tender price, we hope that the rate per loan in cash terms in 1991–92 will be between 1.79p per book and 1.70p per book. In real terms, that will bring it back to the figure of 1988–89 and substantially ahead of every year since 1983–84, except 1985–86.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our aim is to provide a more efficient service and value for money at a cheaper price, because the new computer will have capacity to expand and absorb more volumes, authors and books. Although the registrar can analyse trends, it will have more capacity to do so. It will be able to deal with reciprocal PLR with other countries and we hope that it will produce financial savings. I always approach computer forecasts with some scepticism as I have had to deal with a few of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Torbay (Mr. Allason) and the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central mentioned the rule of three. PLR is restricted to a maximum of three authors, but there is some pressure to reconsider that and the advisory committee is doing so. Someone tells me that the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central is thinking of writing another book supporting Conservative policy on the arts. No doubt he will be a beneficiary of PLR.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference books were mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Torbay and the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central. There has been no pressure from authors to extend PLR to reference books. It would obviously reduce pay-outs to individuals unless the fund were substantially increased and a change would be required in primary legislation. I am prepared to consider the possibility of a pilot project.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that other European countries that have PLR schemes, especially the Scandinavian countries, may give a rather higher amount per loan than us. Several Community countries do not operate PLR schemes—France, Spain, Greece and Portugal, for example. To say that we have the lowest rate per book in the European Community is at least a distortion of the facts because it must be compared with countries that do not operate a PLR scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

The Department of Trade and Industry is in the lead on the draft EC directive on rental and lending rights. The directive is substantial. It would cause a major change in our approach to the public lending right because authors would have an exclusive right to authorise lending. It would extend beyond public libraries to academic and university, and private libraries. That could cause problems for private or academic libraries, which are not set up to handle it. The definition of lending covers reference books. The directive would require us to amend the PLR scheme and add to pressure for increased funds. Our view is generally supportive, but is is possible that we would seek some fairly clear powers of derogation so that our scheme might continue unchanged. We would want a definition of what is to be regarded as equitable remuneration for authors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A positive consequence of the directive would be automatic reciprocity within Community countries. There is no doubt but that United Kingdom authors would gain from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the new registrar will take into account what my hon. Friend the Member for Torbay said about authors having to register for PLR by June, but there must be a cut-off point somewhere. Perhaps when the new computer is in place it will be possible to change that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Torbay gave the slight impression that there is far too much bureaucracy in the scheme. Most authors appreciate the PLR organisation and see it as helpful and efficient I do not get the impression that they mind getting as much detail about their books and what they are registered for as my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Posthumous editions are handled by the executors or trustees of an estate. If a book available is not published before an author dies, they must make the appropriate arrangements for registration. Books and editions published up to 10 years after a registered author's death will be accepted and the benefit obviously goes to the author's heirs, as established under his will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although many authors would like the scheme to offer more money, it is highly regarded by many of them. I refer the Committee to an article that appeared in The Observer on 13 January, in which P. D. James argues that the PLR scheme
	<br><q><p>"enabled many people to be full-time writers who would otherwise have to write part-time."</p></q>
Michael Holroyd, the biographer of Shaw, defended PLR as more a matter of principle. He said that if PLR works as it is supposed to,
	<br><q><p>"it's not payment for need, it's payment for use."</p></q>
He further argued
	<br><q><p>"that the aim was not to reward merit but to remedy a general injustice."</p></q>
He claimed that the scheme
	<br><q><p>"was a great morale-booster as authors were put in touch with the people who borrowed their books instead of buying them."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that of the two rather different views of Michael Holroyd and P. D. James, Michael Holroyd's are probably nearer the spirit of the Minister's opening remarks? Well intentioned though P. D. James's remarks are, when only 63 authors receive £5,000 the idea that the scheme allows authors to write full time who would not otherwise be able to is rather wishful thinking. Almost 10,000 of the authors who benefit from

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
the scheme get less than £100, so Mr. Holroyd is speaking more of the principle than the financial assistance that Miss James mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an important point. The scheme is sometimes blamed for giving too much money to well-known authors who do not need it—Barbara Cartland, Jeffrey Archer and Claire Rayner—but much is distributed to authors who receive less than the £5,000 category. It is interesting that not only P. D. James but others such as Maureen Duffy all stress the importance of this source of income to authors who otherwise would not be writing as much as they do.
