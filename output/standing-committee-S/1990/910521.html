	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General (Sir Nicholas Lyell)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft County Court Remedies Regulations 1991.</p></blockquote>
The regulations are a further step in the reforms that have followed the civil justice review. They complement the High Court and County Courts Jurisdiction Order 1991, which was recently made by my right hon. and noble Friend the Lord Chancellor under section 1 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990. Under that order, the financial limits to the jurisdiction of the county courts will be removed as from 1 July 1991, for all but specialist classes of case. That means that the county courts will enjoy substantial concurrent jurisdiction with the High Court and that the specialist resources of the High Court will be freed for those cases that most need them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to the concurrent financial jurisdiction, the county courts need powers to grant relief similar to those of the High Court. Therefore, section 3 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 substitutes a new section 38 of the County Courts Act 1984, which gives county courts the power to grant, with some exceptions, the same remedies as the High Court. The section also makes provision for the Lord Chancellor to make regulations restricting the use of certain orders in county courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The remedies covered by the draft regulations are those known to lawyers as Anton Piller orders and Mareva injunctions. An Anton Piller order permits entry on to premises to seize documents and other goods for the purpose of preserving evidence in legal proceedings. A Mareva injunction orders the assets of a party to be frozen, pending the determination of proceedings. The regulations generally prohibit county courts from granting Anton Piller orders and Mareva injunctions, except in the patents county court. However, county courts will be permitted to grant Mareva injunctions in certain specified circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The core of the restriction is in regulation 3(1), which provides that county courts may not grant, vary or revoke an Anton Piller order or a Mareva injunction, except in circumstances covered by the regulation. The relevant paragraphs of the regulation provide that both remedies may be granted by a High Court judge and by a judge of the Court of Appeal, in the rare cases when they sit in a county court. They may also be granted by a judge of the patents county court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
That is because of the specialist nature of patents litigation, where litigants frequently need to safeguard evidence or assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
County courts are also permitted to grant Mareva injunctions, but not Anton Piller orders, in family proceedings where property is in dispute, in cases where the property cconcerned forms the subject of the dispute and in cases where judgment has been given and where the court wishes to ensure effective execution of the judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general restriction does not affect powers already vested in county courts by specific statutes. County courts may also vary an Anton Piller order or a Mareva injunction already granted, provided that the parties have agreed the terms of the variation. The regulations provide that the application for an Anton Piller order shall be deemed to include an application for the proceedings to be transferred from the county court to the High Court. They also ensure that proceedings are brought back to the county court after the High Court has disposed of the application for an Anton Piller order or a Mareva injunction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are important regulations, which achieve a balance between protecting people's proper rights and encouraging speed and efficiency in disposing of legal proceedings. I commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.34 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Fraser 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Norwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I am not being unfair in saying that the regulations are a well-presented, elaborate cover-up job which disguise the fact that it was not intended that the county courts be given the ability to grant Anton Piller orders and Mareva injunctions in the first place. The regulations ensure that those powers—which some people think should not be entrusted even to the High Court—should certainly not be entrusted to the county court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, one can have no objection to the regulations and I welcome the correction of an earlier misjudgment. It is interesting that the Government have concluded that Anton Piller orders and Mareva injunctions are such powerful weapons that they should not be entrusted to a county court judge, except on the rare occasions—which I have never witnessed—when a judge of the Court of Appeal sits in the county court. That underlines what powerful weapons the orders are. The Anton Piller order and the Mareva injunction are the legal equivalents of the nuclear deterrent. They can be wide-ranging and have a huge effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is there a current review of the procedure and the effects of the two orders? There is growing appreciation among the legal profession—and perhaps outside as well—that the scope of Anton Piller orders and Mareva injunctions is very wide and that they are often used as weapons by a well-heeled plaintiff to intimidate a more vulnerable defendant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have seen cases where the effect of a Mareva injunction has been to win the proceedings at the interlocutory stage. In some cases, people have been driven out of their businesses and into bankruptcy by the operation of the orders. The Mareva injunction is very
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0588">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
wide indeed. If people who are not eligible for legal aid have a Mareva injunction made against them they have to go to court every time that they want to pay a bill and every time that they want to draw out money, even to pay their lawyers for the costs of the proceedings. The effect of the Mareva injunction is so wide and terrible that it intimidates some defendants into discontinuing the proceedings. The same can be said of Anton Piller orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are reservations about the remedies, which the Government clearly share, because the orders will not be entrusted to county court judges. I have asked the Solicitor-General what reviews of the orders are taking place—even of their use in the High Court—because there is so much anxiety about them. The orders have introduced an inequality in the operation of the law whereby a large, well-equipped City firm may use the orders to obtain a result early in the proceedings against a more vulnerable opponent, provided that it is given enough money in costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations represent a correction of the previous broad regulations about the transfer of jurisdiction to county courts. The solicitors' profession remains anxious about another gap in relation to costs in arbitration proceedings where the amount involved is less than £1,000. The rule is that, if a matter goes to arbitration and the amount at issue is less than £1,000, no costs can be awarded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society is worried that actions for personal injury, which might go to arbitration—they should not really, but they might go to arbitration—would often obtain an award for personal injury for someone vulnerable when it is difficult to calculate damages before the matter comes to court. The risk is that such people might take their cases to arbitration and be penalised for doing so because they are not able to obtain costs. Such actions are rare in arbitration, but, if insurance companies begin to take the view that costs cannot be
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
awarded, they might be tough in negotiating settlements outside arbitration and giving costs in the process. I hope that the Solicitor-General will consider that issue, which is causing great anxiety within the legal profession, and raise it with the Lord Chancellor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.39 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There has in no sense been a cover up. The county courts are left with considerable powers to grant Mareva injunctions in appropriate cases, but only in family proceedings where the family money is in danger of being spirited away or in relation to money or property that is in dispute. That is a necessary power which is given to county court judges in those circumstances. In the wider circumstances, to which the hon. Member for Norwood (Mr. Fraser) referred, use of the orders is confined to a High Court judge and that is sensible. Before I joined the Government, I obtained many Mareva injunctions and Anton Piller orders and I have much experience of how the system works. The orders constitute a valuable and important power of the court. The power can be draconian and must be exercised with care, but I am confident that the regulations achieve the correct balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Personal injury proceedings and whether cases under £1,000 or £500 should go to arbitration are matters that the Lord Chancellor is considering closely. I accept that injustices may arise from the fact that one might not be able to obtain costs in the end, but the opportunity to go to arbitration and not to be at risk on costs is a considerable advantage to the small person. The two must be balanced. The Lord Chancellor is thinking about that and I am sure that he will take note of what the hon. Member for Norwood has said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
