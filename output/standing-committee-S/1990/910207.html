	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='legislation'>Draft Unfair Dismissal (Increase of Compensation Limit) 1991</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Eric Forth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Unfair Dismissal (Increase of Compensation Limit) Order 1991.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the agreement of the Committee, it will be convient to discuss at the same time the other orders before us, namely the draft Unfair Dismissal (Increase of Limits of Basic and Special Awards) Order 1991 and the draft Employment Protection (Variation of Limits) Order 1991.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The orders increase the maximum sum that industrial tribunals can award to individuals whose employment rights have been infringed. They also increase the maximum redundancy payment to which an employee is entitled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are required to review them, we have consulted widely on our proposals, and I recommend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.31 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stretford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must congratulate the Minister for what I think is the briefest speech ever made on any orders. Perhaps his hon. Friends will be able to give him some kind of award.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not intend to delay the Committee for long, but I hope that the Minister will be more forthcoming than he has been, because the orders are important. The Minister said that they deal with compensation for unfair dismissal. Nearly 4,000 people won claims for unfair dismissal last year, which is a significant number. I am sure that no member of the Committee would want to give the impression that he against giving adequate compensation to those deemed by tribunals to have been dismissed in a way that ran counter either to the law or to accepted labour practice. Some of those cases involved racial or sexual discrimination
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The awards have been falling in real purchasing power each year for a considerable number of years. I hope the Minister will comment on that. Last year, the awards dealing with unfair dismissal were not uprated. The Secretary of State has a duty to consider, as the Minister said, but no obligation to increase. For two calendar years there has been no increase in the value of those payments. Why is that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This year the awards increased by much less than the rate of inflation or the rate of average earnings over the comparable period. They did not increase last year. They increased this year at a rate below what it was two years ago but they have fallen in real value for a number of years. For example, compensation for unfair dismissal is four per
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
cent. below its real value in April 1987. We have consistently complained about that persistent pattern, as the Minister will be aware. It is incumbent on him to explain to the Committee and, more generally, to those who will receive such awards why they are being shortchanged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister said, the variation of limits order deals with redundancy payments. Sadly, we know that the economy is in recession and that unemployment and redundancy will be an increasing feature. We also know that the money made available under the order has never kept pace with price increases or average earnings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition regret that the Government are prepared to short-change people who, by definition, are among the most vulnerable. People who have lost their jobs are entitled to something better than the Government's parsimonious attitude. I say this every year: the Opposition will not vote against the order, miserly though the increases are, because it is necessary to have some increase. However, it is incumbent upon the Minister to explain what balance was struck in short-changing people in need of these awards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past, Ministers have trotted out the argument that there is a carefully struck balance between the needs of industry and industrial costs compared with the needs of those who become recipients. I remind the Minister that his colleagues, certainly for awards for unfair dismissal, have in the past placed on record that awards have a deterrent value. That deterrent value is obviously being undermined if the awards are not increased. Therefore, the argument of industrial cost is not one that should apply. Simply, employers should not dismiss people unfairly. If they do, it is necessary to maintain the penalty value of the awards, and the Government have not done that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.36 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The brevity of my introductory remarks in no way undermines the importance attached to these matters. The hon. Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd) is right to point out their importance. He has emphasised, and I agree, the importance that these awards carry for employees, their rights and protection under industrial tribunals and their awards. That much we share.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall do my best to answer the hon. Gentleman's questions. He said that the Secretary of State was obliged to review some of these orders but was not obliged to review others. We have looked carefully at the orders, as we do every year, to try to assess the extent to which any changes need to be made. During that process, the Secretary of State brings to bear a general consideration of the earnings level that prevails at the time, the economic position, which we confront, and also the effect on the business community and the potential effect on employment conditions generally. In doing that, we have to strike a balance—I use that word with no apology—to ensure that we are being fair to individuals but not prejudicing the business community or placing burdens on it to such an extent that levels of employment might be prejudiced. That theme runs through my Department's policies and, indeed, Government policies as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At times when unemployment is, regrettably, rising, we must be more than usually conscious of that factor in arriving at a decision when assessing these orders. I hope the hon. Gentleman will agree with that and share my sensitivity. The last thing that I want to do, in seeking to be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0047">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
as generous as possible to individuals, is to jeopardise the position of the work force at large. Our judgment is that, if we go further than the suggested figures in the orders, that risk will increase.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even if I am prepared to concede the Minister's argument for redundancy payments, which I am not, it does not apply to unfair dismissal. We are not talking about a cost; we are talking about a penalty imposed on an employer who has flouted the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the distinction, but that does not undermine the substance of the argument. If one goes too far in one direction for an award or a penalty, the effect can jeopardise people's jobs. Again, it is a matter of making a judgment and striking a balance between the effects of the orders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd) pointed out, we are talking about unfair dismissal. In most cases that means one person being dismissed at a time and not a whole squad of people. Surely the cost would have a minimal effect on individual employer's costs in most cases? If there were genuine concern about an employer's ability to pay, would it not be better to fix the amount payable at a percentage of the dismissed person's salary rather than fixing a sum that comes nowhere near what that person earns? The Minister said that rising unemployment was taken into account. Account should therefore be taken of the dismissed person's ability to find another job and the time it may take him or her to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is right that such factors should be taken into consideration. In the end, it is a matter of judgment. As Minister with responsibility for small businesses, I am conscious of the effect that provisions might have on the very small business. The hon. Lady's argument may apply more forcefully to larger businesses, but an increase in the burden of even one unfair dismissal to a small business could, in these difficult economic times, jeopardise the business and therefore the jobs of those who remained in employment. That prohibits me from following the hon. Lady's suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot vary the orders today; we can only accept or reject them. I thereofore invite the hon. Lady to write to me and expand her suggestion about percentages. I shall consider it in the context of future orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise that, although we are not obliged to consult on the orders, the Department has consulted widely on the issue to gauge opinion. The Committee will not be surprised to learn that the response was varied. Some whom we consulted wanted the increases kept as low as possible, others agreed with the Opposition members of the Committee and wanted us to be more generous. I believe that we have struck a reasonable balance between the two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tried to avoid an indexation approach to the issue. I understand why Opposition Members want an automatic linkage to the retail prices index or to average earnings. We
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
resist that because it would mean taking a snapshot of the economy when the RPI and average earnings might be rising or falling. At these times, more than any other, to make an arbitrary link between the awards and earnings levels which, by all accounts, are at a very high level at the moment, and RPI which is falling very sharply, is the wrong approach and would be highly detrimental to employees, as well as to the business community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister makes an interesting comment, but his argument is not sustained by the facts. The awards have not increased in line with either average earnings or with retail prices in any year. There is indexation—RPI minus something—because every year the awards lose their purchasing power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is an interesting, if perverse, view that we are applying a reverse, or negative, indexation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is just what the Government are doing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not true. Arithmetically, the hon. Gentleman is entitled to produce a fanciful figure that suggests that, if one takes historical RPI and applies it to the increases, there is a minus factor. I do not dispute that. That does not undermine my arguement that to apply the indexation approach is not only wrong but could be damaging. The Italians got off the scala mobile some time ago when they realised that it was economically damaging. As we are all good Europeans now—including, I hope, the hon. Gentleman—perhaps we should follow that example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to answer the hon. Gentleman's questions. I hope that I have explained the Government's approach and the background to the orders and that the Committee will support them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
