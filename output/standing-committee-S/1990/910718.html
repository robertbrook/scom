	<div class='legislation'>Draft Statistics (Confidentiality) (Northern Ireland) Order 1991</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Dr. Brian Mawhinney)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Statistics (Confidentiality) (Northern Ireland) Order 1991.</p></blockquote>
The purpose of this draft order is to amend the disclosure provisions in the Agriculture Returns Act (Northern Ireland) 1939 and the Statistics of Trade and Employment (Northern Ireland) Order 1988. The current legislation allows only a restricted number of Government Departments to process information gathered under the provisions of the legislation and does not permit the use of computer facilities outside Government. That is clearly a potential constraint on the Government's policy of trying to obtain the greatest possible value for money in the provision of services to Departments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed amendment would remedy that situation. It would allow Departments to pass information collected under the provisions of the current legislation to other Government Departments or to external suppliers of services. The measure would enable Departments to make the most effective and efficient use of resources and so provide the best possible services to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The confidentiality of any information released would be safeguarded by penalties under existing legislation which would apply to personnel in a non-Government organisation in the same way as to civil servants. An additional safeguard would be provided by contractual terms and conditions if it was decided to purchase computing or other services from an organisation outside Government. Personal information would also be subject to the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1984. The order gives Departments the freedom to achieve greater value for money by allowing them to choose the most effective means of processing information. I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.32 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Marshall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leicester, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to delay the Committee. However, having sat on four such Committees in the past two weeks and spoken on only one occasion, I shall register my rpesence verbally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to raise several issues, one of which has been made more pertinent by the Minister's speech. I understand that the two pieces of legislation to which the Minister referred restrict access to information within
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
the two relevant Government Departments. Information that they receive cannot be processed by a central services department covering all the departments of the Northern Ireland Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 4 of the explanatory document issued as background to the order states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"By limiting the processing options open to Departments in these particular cases, the effective utilisation of NI Civil Service resources could be impaired. The proposed draft Order is intended to remove this constraint and allow NI Departments, principally the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Economic Development, access to the widest range of options in the computer processing of information governed by the above legislation."</p></blockquote>
One department referred to is the central information systems division. I assumed, rightly or wrongly, that that was a division of government in Northern Ireland. The Minister is either nodding, or disagreeing with my comments. If the order was restricted to widening the availability of information to all Government Departments, and to making more efficient the analysis of statistical information through one computer access point, I would have no objections to it. That would be desirable. However, the Minister clearly said that the main intention of the order was to give the Government the option of having an outside body to process that information. In that context, I wish to question the Government's motives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it the Government's intention to utilise their central computer facilities in Northern Ireland, or is the real motive behind the order to enable the Government in effect to privatise the analysis of Government information? If it is the latter, the Minister should come clean now. I realise that the explanatory document says that the order has no financial implications, but what kind of savings does the Minister anticipate if the work is to be done by a third party?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The long title of the order contains the word "confidentiality" in brackets. I notice that there is no explicit reference to confidentiality within the order itself. If it is the Government's intention to privatise the analysis of information, how do they intend to safeguard the confidentiality of those statistics that are currently kept within the confines of the Government Departments?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not my intention to oppose the order, even if I dislike the Minister's answer. In that case, I shall pursue the matter through other avenues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.37 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mawhinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his comments. Perhaps I can help. The Department of Agriculture presently collects information on the farming industry under the 1939 Act. That information is processed by the Department of Agriculture, but that Department uses the computer facilities of my Department of Finance and Personnel. In that sense, it is not a central service, but a facility that is centrally available to those Departments that wish to make use of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is right that the purpose of the order is to permit the Government to make use of private sector bodies to enable them to compete for that work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the latter point. However, the Minister said that the Department of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0165">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Agriculture uses the computer facilities in the Minister's Department. If the Department of Agriculture is feeding in the information and receiving it back, that clearly is not in breach of the order. My point was whether the existing legislation prevents—the Department of Agriculture passing information manually to the central computer service and the staff there feeding it into the computer—having direct access to it—rather than the civil servants in the Department of Agriculture.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mawhinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a fairly technical point as to who enters the information into the computer and I shall have to write to the hon. Gentleman on that. However, it is information from the Department of Agriculture, which is processed for the benefit of that Department. Insofar as the Government are under a requirement to make maximum use of and develop maximum value for taxpayers' money, and as computer services expand and increase, so the Government have an obligation to consider whether the services that they have hitherto provided internally might be provided more effectively, more efficiently and at less cost by the priviate sector. That would not be possible under existing legislation, hence this order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
The Government have not decided to privatise that arrangement. The purpose of the order is not to privatise, but to open up the possibility of competitive tendering. Therefore, I cannot answer questions about what savings might be envisaged and so on. The order is to make possible a process that currently is not possible. As such, it should commend itself to most people and, I hope, to the hon. Gentleman. In that spirit, I hope that he will feel free to welcome the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
