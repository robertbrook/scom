Interim detention under the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984</div> <!-- title -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dumfries)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the Bill and all that it endeavours to do. When patients are detained—sometimes against their wishes—relatives are placed under great stress. I hope that we can produce a friendly guide to the rights of patients, relatives and hospitals, so that everyone concerned knows what is going on and no one is left uncertain or disquieted about the procedures being undertaken by the hospital and the doctors. Let us try to help the relatives and the patients understand the procedures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston <span class='memberconstituency'>(Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want, first, to do something that Government spokesmen do not usually do and that is to thank hon. Members who have taken the trouble to turn up, to help the passage of the Bill.<br><br>
It is extraordinary how quickly one gets used to being in the Minister's seat. I have never been here before, but it already feels like my natural place. From now on, I shall look more sympathetically on Ministers who cling to the chance of remaining here.<br><br>
This short Bill was originally part of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Bill. However, the relevant clause, together with others, foundered, after being hit by several well-directed torpedos, not least that launched by the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir Nicholas Fairbairn), who kindly sent me a message that he was unable to attend the debate. However, there was no controversy about the need for that specific clause of the original Bill.<br><br>
I have had some experience of situations comparable to those dealt with by the Mental Health (Detention) (Scotland) Bill, and having corresponded with successive Ministers about them, I happily agreed to the Minister of State's request to pilot the Bill through the House as a separate, self-contained piece of legislation. It received an unopposed Second Reading on 26 April.<br><br>
Before speaking to clause 1, it might be helpful if I briefly outlined why the Bill is necessary. There was a patient—whom I shall call 'B', as it is the tradition not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
to name such patients—who was detained in the Argyll and Bute hospital at Lochgilphead under section 26 of the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984, which authorises detention for a period of 28 days. That period was due to expire on 9 November 1985 at 2 pm. Patient B had made good progress—that often depends on the patient taking medicament regularly—and it was envisaged that no subsequent application for long-term detention would be required. However, shortly before the date of expiry, B suffered a relapse. The responsible medical officer decided that an application for long-term detention would have to be made, under section 18 of the 1984 Act. That application was not made until 11 November and was not proved until 29 November, long after the expiry date of the 28-day detention period under section 26 of the 1984 Act.<br><br>
The dilemma was succintly summarised by the second doctor involved in the case, Dr. Mackay, who said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I was aware of the illegality of this action but felt at a loss to know how the ethical and legal requirements could have been reconciled".</p></blockquote>
On 9 November, when the authorised detention under section 26 was due to expire, Dr. Forsey, who was on duty at the hospital, decided to make an emergency recommendation under section 24 at 2 pm. She was satisfied that if B were allewed to leave he would stop taking his medication and would suffer a further relapse. The recommendation was made to take effect immediately following the expiry of the detention authorised under section 26. On 12 November, the responsible medical officer made a report under section 26 which purported to authorise further detention for 28 days.<br><br>
B, through his lawyers, subsequently brought a petition against both doctors and the health board on the basis that the recommendation and subsequent report made by them were unlawful. The petition was heard by Lord Davidson in the outer house of the Court of Session on 30 July 1986. He found against B and dismissed the petition on the basis that, despite an apparent gap—lawyers would say "lacuna" because they seem to prefer words of three syllables to words of one syllable—in the detention powers in the 1984 Act, the common law allowed the doctors to detain B validly.<br><br>
B appealed to the inner house, which issued its judgment on 20 March 1987. All three judges found in favour of B and stated that his purported detention was illegal. That decision was appealed to the House of Lords by the health board in an attempt to clarify the legal position and, on final appeal, the decision of the inner house was upheld. It was accepted that there is a gap in the legislation and that is why the Bill is necessary.<br><br>
Sections 24 and 26 of the 1984 Act provide for the detention of mentally disordered persons in cases of emergency for three days and 28 days respectively. To prevent abuse of the system, the Act stipulates in subsections 24(6) and 26(7) that on expiry of the authorised detention there can be no immediate reimposition of the powers of section 24 or section 26. Instead, where it is necessary to detain a patient for a longer period, section 18 must he invoked.<br><br>
An application for admission to hospital under section 18 must be made by the person's nearest relative or
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0198">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
a mental health officer. The application must be accompanied by two medical recommendations in the prescribed form and submitted to, and approved by the sheriff.<br><br>
That procedure works satisfactorily in the majority of cases, but, occasionally—I have just mentioned one such example—a patient detained under section 26 may initially make good progress and then deteriorate suddenly and unexpectedly. That happened in the case of <i>B v. Forsey.</i> In such a situation, the parties may have insufficient time to complete and obtain section 18 approval from the sheriff before the detention expires. That leaves the hospital with no authority to detain the patient in the interim, although he or she may be in much need of treatment in hospital and unwilling to remain there as a voluntary patient.<br><br>
Clause 1 is designed to overcome that problem by inserting a new section 26A into the 1984 Act. It will enable a medical practitioner, to lodge a report on the patient's condition with the sheriff clerk indicating that, in his opinion, the patient requires to be further detained. Once such a report has been lodged, detention is extended for a further three days to enable a section 18 application for admission to be made. As hon. Members of the Committee will have observed, I have tabled an amendment to clause 2 to extend that period from three to five days and I hope that the Committee will consider it favourably.<br><br>
Several safeguards are included in clause 1. For example, a report should not be lodged unless, where practicable, the consent of the nearest relative or a mental health officer has been obtained. The patient also has a right of appeal against continued detention.<br><br>
Clause 1 is an important and advisable addition to the 1984 Act.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brian Wilson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cunninghame, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) for the manner in which he presented the Bill. I endorse his opinion that he fits the role admirably—he has been denied it too long. If he had a slight shift of party allegiance, he would hold onto his seat and return to that role after the next general election. I should not venture such a suggestion, however, in case the Labour candidate for his constituency reads the report.<br><br>
I agree with the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Munro) that it is important for people to be clear about their rights and the legal position. As a comment on my own profession, the effects of the Bill should be reported in the Scottish media. Unfortunately, that probably will not happen, but people should be told when there has been a change in the law. Significant interest groups and individuals will be directly affected by the Bill and they would be interested to read of the proceedings.<br><br>
I do not wish to be melodramatic, but the Bill could be a matter of life or death. I have a case in my constituency that fits closely with the legislation. In that example the neighbours of a patient in hospital are in fear for their lives and personal safety if that individual returns to the community. They believe that he should not be returned to the community in his condition.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
If the strict letter of the law is observed and individuals are conscious of their rights, the medical profession may have to discharge patients against their better judgment when a 28 day order expires, unless they can act timeously and extend the periods of detention. If there is a hiatus between periods of detention, the consequences can be serious. My comments relate to the case in my constituency, on which I have corresponded with the local health board.<br><br>
The Bill will introduce pragmatism into the process and will remove the moral, legal and ethical dilemmas of doctors. Doctors have difficulty in adapting the existing mechanism to the needs of patients, but their position will be made more straightforward.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber spelt his argument out clearly by quoting the case at the Argyll and Bute Hospital. That example illustrates the potential for change in the condition of patients, the dilemmas faced by doctors and—perhaps most importantly—the view of the judiciary when cases are brought to court.<br><br>
I served on the Committee that considered the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1990, which was one of the most interesting Committees that I have been on. The original terms of that Act included many useful, non-controversial items that it would have been proper to introduce and which would have attracted little dissent. I believe that we should have more Bills that encompass a large number of small reforms, significant to a small number of people only, but which update the law and make it more relevant to practical needs. I am sure that the truncation of the 1990 Act meant that we lost useful, non-controversial measures.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
I am delighted that the relevant proposal has been brought back in its present form and congratulate the Government on having given it such an easy passage. I also congratulate the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber on the way in which he has presented it. The Bill has the Opposition's full support.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I also congratulate the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston). Although the Bill is short, it covers a complex area of law and I know that much work went into producing it. The Government would certainly welcome the Bill's enactment.<br><br>
The provisions outlined in clause 1 for another three days detention are important. The hon. Gentleman gave an example of a case that caused concern. The five-day provision, which relates to clause 2, relates to the time during which applications for admission must be heard whereas the three-day provision relates to the extension of the period of detention.<br><br>
This is an extremely useful piece of legislation and, unusually, I agree with the hon. Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) that this type of legislation, and the manner in which it has been presented should be encouraged.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0199">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
Once again I thank the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber for bringing the Bill before the House. He has the Government's support for all of the provisions that he seeks to introduce.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is correct to say that the five-day period refers to clause 2 and the three-day period to clause 1.<br><br>
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) for his remarks. It is not possible to say whether this particular Bill applies directly to the case he is thinking about. I know of a case of a lady who was let out of hospital who ended up on my front lawn sticking a knife into a passer by who subsequently needed 12 stitches. That was alarming for my wife, and for my young children. I am told that this Bill would make no difference to such a case. Once enacted perhaps the Bill will affect the general climate against which doctors make difficult decisions between the liberty of the individual and the protection of Society.</span></p>

DETERMINATION OF APPLICATIONS FOR ADMISSION TO HOSPITAL.</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 3, line 15, leave out "three" and insert "five".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 2, in page 3, line 25, leave out "three" and insert "five".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would substitute five days for three days in clause 2(2). The Bill, as drafted, places a requirement upon sheriffs to determine or hear all section 18 applications for admission to mental hospitals within three days.<br><br>
When the clause is read in conjunction with the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
requirements placed on the sheriff under section 113 of the 1984 Act, it obliges him to give the patient or his representative an opportunity of being heard except where it is established that it would be prejudicial to the patient's health or treatment if the sheriff were present.<br><br>
When one considers the three day requirement and section 113 of the 1984 Act together, the question arises as to whether fair notice is given to the person who is the subject of the application so that he has adequate time to obtain legal advice and to prepare himself for any hearing. If the three day requirement were left in the Bill, the period of notice of an application would, be one or two days at best. I hope that the Committee will agree that that could be unfair to the subject of that application. Sherrifs could face problems, especially in smaller courts, in meeting the demands of that short timetable. The remaining part of the clause allows that the sheriff may adjourn a hearing; but that does not rectify the problem.<br><br>
The clause can be criticised—those responsbile for the administration of the Scottish courts have already pointed out some difficulties—and will cause problems later if it is not amended. I am advised that a period of five days would be reasonable. That change still preserves the principle that applications will be dealt with promptly by the courts.</span></p>
