	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Aviation, Shipping and Public Transport (Mr. Patrick McLoughlin)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Merchant Shipping (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Order 1990.</p></blockquote>
Before I explain the order, I welcome the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms. Walley) to the Committee as this is the first time that, together, we have dealt with merchant shipping regulations. I congratulate the hon. Lady on her appointment and I look forward to good debates here and elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order amends the Merchant Shipping (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Order 1987, which enables regulations to be made to give effect to annex II of the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships, 1973. The order will empower the Secretary of State to amend the regulations to incorporate updated requirements that have been adopted by the International, Maritime Organisation. It will also empower the Secretary of State to make regulations to give effect to annex III of the convention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships—better known as the MARPOL convention — is the principal international instrument for controlling pollution from ships. It contains five annexes dealing with oil, noxious liquid substances in bulk, packaged dangerous goods, sewage and garbage. It is revised by the IMO as circumstances dictate which enables its provisions to keep up with newer practices and reflect current public concern. The convention commands wide international support and it is only through its regulations that we can improve the cleanliness of our seas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Annex II of the MARPOL convention sets out the measures for preventing the pollution of the sea from noxious liquid substances in bulk. It categorises those substances into four groups according to their potential for pollution, prescribing for each category how it should be controlled and monitored. The list of substances is continually assessed by internationally recognised experts and, in the light of discussions in the IMO, the severity ratings of some substances are altered and new substances are added to the list.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Annex III to the convention deals with the prevention of pollution by marine pollutants carried in packaged form. It has been decided by the IMO that, for convenience and good order, annex III should be implemented by incorporation into the international maritime dangerous goods code. The code was developed for substances that are dangerous, rather than pollutants. However, the general precautions that need to be observed—whether a substance is dangerous or a pollutant—are the same and in transporting those substances on board ship, the trade does
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
not differentiate between the two. A completely new edition of the code has therefore been developed by the IMO that incorporates pollutants and, for the first time, applies to them requirements on packaging, marking and labelling, documentation, stowage and segregation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Annex III, though ratified by the United Kingdom as long ago as 27 May 1986, is not in force internationally because the number of ratifications by member Governments of the IMO is just short of that necessary to bring it into effect. The delay is a cause for concern and the IMO has urged member states to implement the annex in advance of it coming into force internationally. Ministers attending the North Sea conference in March of this year agreed to give effect to the new edition of the international maritime dangerous goods code by 1 January 1991.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulations made under this order are being prepared to give effect to annex III. They will incorporate broadly the same duties and responsibilities that are to be found in the Merchant Shipping (Dangerous Goods) Regulations and will include a variety of ancillary provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Committee will appreciate the need for the order, which is intended to help make cleaner the seas and oceans around the world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.34 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Joan Walley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I should like to thank the Minister for his generous remarks. This is the first statutory instruments Committee I have attended in my new capacity and I look forward to learning as much as possible, so that a future Labour Government can ensure that similar regulations are properly enforced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past 25 years, the pollution of the world's oceans has caused increasing international anxiety. Most pollution comes from land-based sources, and includes the byproducts of industry, run-off from agricultural pesticides and herbicides, and effluence discharged from urban areas. Shipping and maritime activities, however, also cause a great deal of pollution, although the substances discharged vary in quantity and potential harm to the environment. The measures introduced by the IMO have provided a framework for reducing marine pollution from ships, but the problem remains. It is important to ensure the effective implementation of existing measures, as well as the adoption of new regulations, because only when that is achieved can the Government introduce new regulations effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations are a typical example of the Government's hands-off, minimalist approach. Little is stated in the order about reception facilities or enforcement authorities. The Government have left implementation to local and other authorities, and have provided them with little support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Annex III(2)(a) of MARPOL deals with the documentation and certificates for surveys and inspections. Documents relevant to the substances carried on board should be kept on the ship and on shore by the shipping company, the port authorities and the local authorities responsible for the transportation of hazardous material. Annex III(2)(d) tackles fines,
	<br><blockquote><p>"not exceeding the statutory maximum"</p></blockquote>
and convictions. However, the level of the fines should be stated and increased above the minimal levels that form the present statutory maximum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0615">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Annex III(2)(f) mentions:
	<br><blockquote><p>"detaining any ship in respect of which a contravention is suspected to have occurred".</p></blockquote>
The problem with MARPOL protocol is that the regulations will only be effected by those countries that have ratified the proposals and not necessarily by those who have signed MARPOL as member states. Countries that have not ratified the annexes should be banned from our waters as that would maintain the higher standards and encourage those countries to ratify the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Annex III is not in force internationally. By October 1990, only 41 countries with 48 per cent. of world tonnage had ratified the proposals. Annex III(3)(b) provides for "exemptions for different circumstances" without specifying what would qualify for an exemption. It is a catch-all phrase that needs to be tightened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Annex III(3)(c) provides for:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the delegation of functions exercisable by virtue of the regulations".</p></blockquote>
Which enforcement body should carry out the regulatory functions—local authority organisations or trade associations? Who will be responsible for monitoring the implementation of the regulations? The Government should stipulate that. I would welcome the Minister's comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within the climate of deregulation and privatisation, the Government have no intention of providing a coherent package of regulations but the lack of a unified network system seriously undermines shipping and transport infrastructure. Integrated pollution control has not been implemented, despite the Environmental Protection Act 1990. You know all about that Act, Mr. Leadbitter, as you, chaired so many of the Committee sittings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If new regulations are introduced when existing regulations are not properly enforced, what safeguards exist to ensure that present requirements are implemented? One of our main anxieties arises from the lack of expertise and the shortage of trained staff. We hear a great deal at the moment about the need for greater investment in the infrastructure for training and skills to match that of other countries. That infrastructure provides all levels of operatives and officers, and I hope that the Minister will comment on the training and staffing levels needed to implement the regulations. I also hope that the Minister will describe the existing staffing levels within the Department of Transport's marine inspectorate. My experience of the matter is limited, but I understand that the skill shortage within that inspectorate is analagous with that in her Majesty's inspectorate of pollution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ships become more sophisticated each year, therefore, their operation requires even higher educational standards and experience. It is signifgicant that most incidents of maritime pollution, whether from direct casualties, collisions, oil spills, incorrectly stored cargo, the washing-out of tanks or general disposal operations, involve flag of convenience ships. Such ships do not have to comply with the saftey and seaworthiness standards demanded by the Department of Transport. Even though they may be inspected by the Department on arrival at United Kingdom ports, the number of inspectors employed by the Department has been cut. I think that the Committee should be given some information about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The need for well-trained inspectors could not be more apparent. The Minister may be aware that a survey carried out in Southampton in 1989 showed that nearly 80 per cent. of the flag of convenience ships inspected were found to
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
have one or more defects. Given that only one in 20 or 30 flag of convenience ships were inspected, that does not inspire much confidence in the operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Flag of convenience ships are invariably crewed with low-cost seafarers from developing countries, whose training and qualifications fall short of safe standards and who are chosen to circumvent income tax, social security payments, trade unions, western wage levels and health and safety regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The deregulatory climate in which shipowners operate has led them to seek registration in offshore tax havens. Any anti-pollution measures regarded as direct costs will be resisted, as flag of convenience ships have little incentive to comply with them. United Kingdom shipowners pledged to decent standards, including pollution control, cannot survive without direct or indirect Government assistance through the shipping industry. Although I am new to my post, Mr. Leadbitter, I have made a point of visiting the Baltic exchange and, from the discussions there, I have learnt that there is much unease about the decline in the number of ships that sail from this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulations to tighten up on marine pollution are irrelevant unless they are enforced and carry meaningful penalties. In 1989, a study by the Dutch group Werkgrope Noordzee contained 300 reports from states bordering the North Sea of violations of MARPOL 73/78 discharge rules. It showed that only 51—that is, 17 per cent.—of those reports were followed up by the flag states of the ships involved. There was no prosecution in 64 cases because the proof given by the reporting states appeared insufficient. Only 18 of the 300 cases were subject to penal prosecution, and even then the fines were very low compared to what the vessel would have to pay for the use of port reception facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The introduction of crude oil washing and segregated ballast tanks has reduced some of the need for oily-waste reception facilities. Improvements in the efficiency of the discharge of chemicals have had a similar effect. According to the IMO, reception facilities are still inadequate despite its efforts to promote and encourage their construction and use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must get rid of waste—a ship does so by discharging while in port, which leaves the port with the problem. Treatment of wastes involves expenditure, but under the present system, the chances of avoiding detection and punishment are good. The natural inclination of free marketeers is to avoid facilities entirely and dispose of wastes elsewhere, which underlines the need for enforcement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The IMO study of mechanisms for financing reception facilities is welcome. However, it is the Government's duty to overcome such problems during the 1990s and to formulate an integrated transport system that takes environmental protection fully into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One cannot consider the new regulations in isolation and, in that context, the ageing of ships is a serious problem. During the 1980s, the number of ships of 10 years old or less fell from 62 per cent. to 36 per cent. Older ships are far more vulnerable than new ones to accidents, breakdowns and the like and that places a greater responsibility on the enforcement agencies of flag states and port states to implement international standards. The high cost of applying standards retrospectively to older ships should not be used to circumvent the needs of safety and pollution prevention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0616">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
The new regulations are a step forward in tackling problems of marine pollution but, without enforcement, they are meaningless. The problems of ageing fleets and the increasing use of flag of convenience ships must be urgently addressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1989, the Perentis, a former second world war landing craft built in 1944, sank off the Channel Islands while sailing under the Indonesian flag. It was carrying a cargo of toxic lindane, which is still to be found. I note that the Minister is furiously looking through his notes. I hope that he can explain how we are to secure a cleaner marine environment when we cannot even find such a potentially lethal and dangerous cargo. It is critical to ensure that such an incident never happens again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Deregulation is a free marketeer's dream, but if it applied to road haulage, Department of Transport standards would not be effective—there would be no MOTs; no restriction on the hours of drivers; no compulsory insurance; and a 60 per cent. cut in the number of police on duty. That would lead to a huge public outcry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Shipping, in comparison, is all too often out of sight and out of mind—until a disaster happens. It is the Government's duty to ensure that the proper legislative and enforcement framework is in place so that disasters never happen. I stress that enforcement is crucial; without it we cannot have any confidence that the regulations will make any difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.47 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Field 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Isle of Wight)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also welcome the hon.' Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms. Walley) to this Committee. I was the first Conservative Member to debate pollution issues with the hon. Lady when she first joined the Opposition Front Bench and our debate took place on the BBC World Service—I have never been invited back, which may say something about my debating prowess.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady referred to the lindane cargo that was lost in the Channel; but the Navy identified and recovered part of it. Moreover, within 24 hours, the Department of Transport had the manifest of the cargo and were able to give it to the coastguard service, the Royal Navy and the French authorities. That was very quick indeed. In fact, the vessel had nothing to do with the United Kingdom authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pollution at sea takes many forms. The principal anxiety—especially on the south coast—arises from the problem of oil slicks on our beaches, which makes the national press and hits national and international headlines. A measure of the Government's success in controlling pollution at sea, is that such an incident is now rare and is widely reported, rather than a regular occurrence as in my younger days when we got covered in tar when we went down to the beach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, Christmas comes but once a year and so, it seems, does the annual oil slick in the Channel. My hon. Friend the Minister and his officials know that I raise this matter every year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An oil slick occurs with monotonous regularity in the Channel just after Christmas and does exceptional damage to our sea birds off the south coast. The slick wanders somewhere between Land's End and North Foreland. My hon. Friend has assured me that the crew of the marine pollution control unit's spotter aircraft do not rest for
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
Christmas turkey and are on duty over the Christmas period. Therefore, the allegations that have appeared in the press that unscrupulous shipowners take advantage of the control unit's relaxed guard to pump out dirty bilges or to clean their tanks in the Channel are unfair. However, I require reassurance from my hon. Friend on that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend knows that the company, Vikoma, in my constituency produces much of the pollution control equipment used in the oil industry throughout the world. In addition, an inventor on the island has named his invention half after himself—the Frogmat boom. It uses straw stubble from the fields to make a long sausage which absorbs about seven or eight times its weight in spilt oil. I am concerned that the Government continue to put the emphasis on spraying to clean up oil slicks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Frogmat boom has a real role to play in fighting pollution in our estuaries. The Dover Straits are a natural chicane for about 40 per cent. of the world's shipping traffic as it approaches Europe and Europort. For the life of me, I wonder why it is not possible for us and the French to get together and find out the manifest of every ship passing through the Straits. They are a natural constriction point and it should be possible to establish a reporting procedure to give us greater control over shipping.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Oil slicks are often spotted long after the offending ship has moved on. Such ships proceed at an average speed of 16 knots, so they do not suddenly switch to hyperspace and disappear over the horizon. I am told that even when a sample of oil is taken from a ship's hold, it is impossible to match it with a slick and secure a prosecution. The number of successful prosecutions for oil spills in the channel and surrounding waters is very low.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I doubt whether my hon. Friend can tell me today, but perhaps he will write to say whether the order will apply to balloon racing. I have been responsible for setting off more than a few balloon races in my time, but the World Wide Fund for Nature is worried about the number of balloons that have been ingested by dolphins to their lasting harm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Fields 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Liverpool, Broadgreen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In essence, anyone with an ounce of concern for the environment, especially the sea, would welcome the thrust of the regulations. My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms. Walley) has adequately outlined some of the problems. I should like to take the matter further without delaying the Committee too long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is to be uniformity in packaging, labelling and everything else, there must be consultation. It is all very well to specify matters in regulations without having the wit, will or intelligence to know what needs to be done; there must be consultation with local authorities, port authorities and, what is more important in my view, the fire service. Hazchem relates to the transportation of dangerous substances such as chemicals by road and it came about only through the pressure and insistence of the Fire Brigades Union. It should also be consulted in this context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We could pay lip service to this issue, nod our heads and clear off, but we must give serious attention to what we are discussing. My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North raised the question of punishable offences and the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Field) spoke of the Government's wonderful record of success. If the hon. Gentleman visited the river Mersey he would discover how
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0617">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
often it has been polluted by multinational companies that stick two fingers up to the existing regulations. They are rather like some of the jokers in London and elsewhere who have big cars which they park on yellow lines and pay fines because they can afford to do so. I believe that the same will apply to the new regulations if we do not watch what is going on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also pay serious attention to monitoring. With the greatest respect to those who are currently responsible for carrying it out, and given their increased work load, unless we provide additional inspectors to survey and monitor what goes on, the regulations will be meaningless. To get the scheme off the ground more staff will be needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On land, the record of some people is an absolute scandal. Non-adherence to existing regulations covering transportation by road and rail leads me to believe that people will prove to be no more responsible when the marine regulations come into force.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Colvin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Romsey and Waterside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Liverpool, Broadgreen (Mr. Fields) mentioned pollution of the river Mersey. However, the Water Act 1989 and the provision for the Government to impose heavy fines on polluters enabled them to fine the oil company, Shell, £1 million for an oil slick in the Mersey. It is obvious that the National Rivers Authority has considerable powers which were absent in the days when the water authorities were part of the public sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Solent divides the constituency of my hon. Friend. the Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Field) from mine, so I fully endorse all that he said about the problems caused by pollution at sea. With regard to his comments about balloons and balloon races, the same could be said about condoms which float around in the sea, especially in view of the efforts being made to improve birth control. The sooner that we have biodegradable balloons and condoms, the better it will be, especially for my beaches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Opposition spokesman, the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms. Walley), to her new position. The hon. Lady spoke about the standards of equipment aboard ships in Southampton and referred to a survey carried out there in 1989. Does my hon. Friend the Minister have the power to inspect ships, especially those returning to service after being laid up? In the past few years, excessive shipping tonnage has been laid up and the onus has been on ship owners to bring those ships back into commission. It is essential to ensure that the equipment on such ships is up to standard. A case relating to an oil spillage in the Solent is still sub judice, but I believe that it was due to defective equipment in a ship which had been laid up for some years and was recommissioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must declare a constituency interest in the transportation of toxic waste by sea as one of the ReChem plants is at Fawley in my constituency. There has been considerable discussion about the transportation of polychlorinated byphenyls—PCBs—by sea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What discussions has my hon. Friend had with the Department of the Environment about international efforts to persuade countries of origin to destroy their toxic waste in situ? I think that it is irresponsible to transport that material around the high seas, although I accept that those countries, such as the United Kingdom, that have facilities
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
for the disposal of toxic waste have a duty to dispose of it, if it comes here, in the interests of international control of pollution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time, we must bring all possible pressure to bear on those countries that originate the waste to dispose of it themselves. There was a great deal of controversy about a recent shipment from Canada, but, although Canada was blamed for having shipped the PCBs, that country is, nevertheless, a net importer of toxic waste, having become a dumping ground for American waste which is moved up-country. The problem in Canada is that often it is the provinces rather than the federal Government which make the decisions to ship the waste.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What steps are being taken by the other Department involved, the Department of the Environment, to persuade countries to dispose of their own waste?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final question to the Minister concerns something of which you, Mr. Leadbitter, are aware—the growing practice of transporting nuclear fuel by sea. You and I visited Japan this year as members of the Select Committee on Energy. We know that Japan already has 40 nuclear power stations and is building a further 40, and is also heavily committed to the fast-breeder programme for which the fuel—largely processed in this country—is plutonium. It is the fuel of the atomic bomb, and Japan, by terms of the peace treaty, is precluded from making such fuel. Therefore it must be transported by sea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the use of nuclear power increases, we shall inevitably see more nuclear fuel transported by sea. What steps does the Minister feel should be taken under the order to increase the regulations governing the transport of that highly volatile—and highly emotive—fuel for nuclear power stations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.2 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Nelson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chichester)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to follow my hon. Friends the Members for Romsey and Waterside (Mr. Colvin) and for Isle of Wight (Mr. Field), who know a great deal about this subject and whose constituencies are close to mine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to congratulate the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms. Walley) on her well-researched and interesting speech, although she was a little mean on praise for my hon. Friend the Minister for bringing forward the order. It is a welcome ratification of our international obligations and should bring relief and reassurance to my constituents and others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today, there is little else on the minds of the inhabitants of the villages of East Wittering, West Wittering and Selsey than the Merchant Shipping (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Order. They have asked me to come to the Committee to tell my hon. Friend the Minister that they attach the greatest importance to the order, and welcome the priority and importance that the Government are giving to it, especially on a day when there are so many other claims on the attention of Members of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On behalf of my constituents in those villages and elsewhere around the coast in the Chichester district and extending into Chichester harbour—where there are probably more private yachts and boats tied up than there are anywhere else in the country—we are anxious on three counts. First, we are concerned about the environmental quality of life that my constituents and visitors can enjoy; secondly, the safety and prosperity of the fishing industry,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0618">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
particularly that of the boats that go out from Selsey; and thirdly, the cleanliness of our beaches, which attract visitors to my constituency from home and abroad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Selsey lands some of the finest lobsters and crabs in the world. Let me take this opportunity to invite you, Mr. Leadbitter, and other members of the Committee to come and enjoy at my expense some Selsey crabs and oysters in the certainty that you will find them without parallel worldwide. That is reflected in the long tradition of the availability of Selsey lobster on the QE2 since the days of the Queen Mary. We want to keep our lobsters clean. The local fishing and shellfishing industries are important and the reassurance of such measures will give them confidence and ensure their prosperity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ask my hon. Friend the Minister some specific questions. First, I understand that the order applies not just to British registered shipping, but to all vessels, notably in the Solent and channel area about which I am most anxious. Is that correct? Secondly, while we are giving effect to certain annexes to the international convention on the prevention of pollution, are the regulations common throughout the countries that ratify the agreement?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the anxiety of other hon. Members about the extent to which we can control the practices of foreign shipping. Time and again I hear alarming stories about inadequately manned foreign vessels off the coast of my constituency with improperly tied and stowed goods on board and below deck. A month ago I was on a local frigate, HMS Charybdis and the captain told me that when he telephoned through to a large freight-carrying foreign, vessel that seemed to be off course between the Isle of Wight and my constituency, there was no one on the bridge. He knew that because, as he was telephoning, he could see the skipper of the vessel going up the steps on the outside of the bridge to answer the telephone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know the answer to how to enforce or provide sufficient penalties, but I should like all skippers and owners who bring vessels into the Solent and channel to know that they are in a hot area where they will be supervised carefully. If my hon. Friend the Minister parks on a double-yellow line in the Westminster district, he knows that he is likely to be clamped. The owners of most vessels that come into the areas about which I am anxious think that they can get away with it. The best deterrent is the likelihood of detection. If owners believe that they are likely to be challenged, they will desist from the worst practices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North is right to inquire about the mechanisms for supervision and the penalties that should be imposed. If my hon. Friend the Minister can provide the reassurance that we all seek, he will be welcomed even more warmly when he next comes to the Manhood peninsular and enjoys with me the delights of our local shellfish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Gill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ludlow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that hon. Members wish to support all measures that aim to reduce pollution and we look forward to the day when pollution has been reduced to an acceptable level. However, too often we believe that simply by legislating we shall remove a problem. I must say to the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms. Walley) that if a balance is not struck between legislation and what is practicable and acceptable
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
to those whom it affects, the effect may be to encourage more polluters. If legislation imposes additional burdens and costs on bona fide operators who fight the battle to the extent that they become uncompetitive, more trade may be diverted to ships that operate under flags of convenience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady referred to the MOT test for vehicles and I invite her to consider its effect on many citizens, such as me,who have no intention of driving a car with bald tyres, defective brakes or unsatisfactory lights. We all pay the cost of having our cars tested but that has not removed from our roads many unsatisfactory vehicles. The concept that legislation can remove a problem should be considered with caution and I question the economics of imposing higher costs on bona fide operators because that may have the reverse effect of that intended by encouraging more cowboy operators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was pleased that the hon. Lady said that education is important in such matters and I agree. Hand in hand with legislation, we must have an education programme to persuade more and more people of the reasons and benefits of reducing pollution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a good and wide-ranging debate. I did not expect it to catch the headlines, bearing in mind what else is happening today, but if more people had been in the Committee and heard about balloon races and biodegradeable condoms, we might have attracted more attention. I pay tribute to the way in which the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms. Walley) researched the subject. She may have had some qualms when she discovered that she was to be responsible for the matter. Her constituency almost borders mine and I had qualms when I discovered that I was to be the Minister for shipping because I have the most landlocked constituency in the United Kingdom. The hon. Lady has gone through a great learning curve quickly and has accomplished that very well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all agree that we must work through the IMO when introducing such regulations as it would be pointless for us to introduce extra regulations covering British shipping or United Kingdom waters. It is vital to have international standards and that is the role of the IMO—its headquarters are just across the river and it has 141 members and two observers. Its membership is widely drawn. The best way in which to deal with such matters is through the IMO. I am pleased that we signed the ratification of annex III in Niger in 1986 and I hope that the few countries that have so far held out will soon sign, so that we may have proper ratification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) asked whether the regulations will apply to all vessels in United Kingdom waters. The answer is unequivocally yes. He also asked whether they will be common to all countries that have signed the IMO ratification. Again the answer is unequivocally yes. This is an important step forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North asked several questions, some of which were wider than the terms of our debate. Subsidy is a matter on which we could have a longer debate than we have time for this morning and is wider than the terms of the order. It is important that countries do not try to subsidise their own industries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0619">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
We have seen the mess that can result from that. The United States subsidises its shipping industry heavily, but that has not made it more competitive. In fact, only 4 per cent. of its trade is carried out by United States registered ships.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked about article III. That article only enables further regulations to be made. We hope to bring forward a number of such regulations in December, but I shall not go into detail about them now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must be careful about discussing matters such as the Perentis. Checking my notes when the hon. Lady mentioned that incident, I confirmed by recollection that the vessel was lost in French, and not English, waters. There is a limit to the degree of control or knowledge that we can have of vessels in transit in any particular area. I do not think that the United Kingdom should attempt to monitor or police waters that are beyond our control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that inspection is vital, and the United Kingdom has a record of which we can be proud. We signed the Paris memorandum about the state control of ports which required us to inspect 25 per cent., of ships entering our waters. The inspections—full or otherwise, depending on what is considered necessary—are carried out by the Surveyor General's department. We have far exceeded the specified rate of 25 per cent. and, at nearly 30 per cent. of ships our inspection rate is one of the highest in Europe. We should take pride in that achievement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that some of the figures given by the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent,, North (Ms. Walley) dealt with port state control in connection with ship safety, and had nothing to do with pollution control?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. My hon. Friend has made a valid point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's aim is to ensure that our waters are safe, clean and protected. My hon. Friend, the Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Field) spoke about the yearly oil spill. Sometimes it is hard to say how such accidents happen. One incident last year involved a very large oil tanker. On a Saturday afternoon of clear visibility, a small ship ran into its side. I cannot mention names because the matter is under investigation by the Marine Accident Investigation Bureau, but I did answer a private notice question about it in the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must convey to all parties involved in marine safety that the most dangerous times are when people become complacent with the machinery that they are using. That warning applies all along the line, although the ultimate responsibility lies with the captain. Where such accidents happen, it is wholly right that the polluter should pay for the damage that is caused. My hon. Friend the Member for Romsey and Waterside (Mr. Colvin), responding to the questions raised by the hon. Member for Liverpool, Broad green (Mr. Fields), made that point very clear. The legislation that privatised the water companies instituted the National Rivers Authority, which meant that very large fines could be imposed on such companies. The hon. Gentleman would like the fines to be harder and heavier. That is fair enough, but I am glad that we have gone a long way towards ensuring that those who pollute our waterways and oceans should pay for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Fields</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fine was set at £1 million, but there have been two subsequent incidents of pollution by the same firm. My point is that the fines amount to not more than a drop in the ocean.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that it is not a drop in the ocean. It is also very bad publicity for that company, which may feel the effect of its customers anxieties if it does not clean up its act. If it continues, the courts must decide what further action to take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North spoke also about reception facilities. We recognise that there is a shortage of reception facilities in some countries. We have urged the IMO that all states should provide adequate facilities. I stress again that United Kingdom ports provide adequate reception facilities, and that we want to see them made available in other countries. We should not talk down the United Kingdom as if we were always the bad guys. We signed the ratification document in 1986 and we provide reception facilities. We want those who pollute our waterways to be prosecuted. We inspect our ships at a higher rate than most of our European partners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to say that we believe in having a merchant shipping fleet. We do not want to put extra liabilities on the fleet as that is not the way to attract new carriers or ships to our register, a point well made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Gill). The more one becomes involved, the more one realises what an international subject we are dealing with. It is almost impossible to take unilateral actions that do not have consequences elsewhere. Our policy is based on working through the IMO, and that has generally been welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight made several points. He thought that we sometimes use too much spray and dispersant on cleaning up oil spills and that it would be better to use the Frogmat boom. The marine pollution control unit will consider that. We need, however, to respond quickly to oil spills. Dependant on weather conditions, the quickest response is usually spraying dispersant, but we do not use it without clearance from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food because, as my hon. Friend said, the dispersant could destroy fishing grounds. We know, however, that oil emulsifies after a day. One might talk at first of a spill of 500 tonnes of oil, but unless it is dispersed quickly it soon becomes 2,000 to 3,000 tonnes. Dispersal at an early stage is vital. That is why aerial spraying is often undertaken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Isle of White wants us to check the cargoes of all ships passing through the Dover straits. I can see the attraction, but the size of ships and their cargoes make that impractical. Incidents are rare. I doubt whether the best way to control such incidents is to know the cargo of every ship that sails through the channel. Some ships may not be travelling through English waters. If we were to check but the French did not, the scheme would be nonsensical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will be aware that there is excellent co-operation between ourselves and the French authorities on traffic separation in the channel. There was a great debate on whether it would work. Now that all ships are monitored as they pass through the Dover straits and past the mid-channel buoy—ships can be patrolled and photographed if they do not observe the traffic separation rules—it seems a simple procedure that they should report their cargo manifest as they come to the western
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0620">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
approaches or as they leave Europort on their way out. That can be recorded, so that if there is an incident, it is known automatically and immediately what the ship is carrying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall take on board my hon. Friend's suggestion, and consider it further. My initial reaction is as I have said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Romsey and Waterside made various points. I have dealt with the inspection of ships. The issue of destroying wastes in the country of origin is important. My hon. Friend will have heard my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment discussing that when the number of ships arriving from Canada to dump here was a controversial issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that it is one thing to say that much is being done by different Departments to put pressure on countries to dispose of their own toxic waste, but quite another to ensure that they actually take the proper action. I am worried that whenever ReChem is mentioned outside this place, anxiety is expressed about the environmental effects of the process that the company uses to get rid of PCBs. We need to adopt a more integrated approach—at intra-departmental level—to ensure that the environmental issues are dealt with properly. We need to pay more than lip service to environmental protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition propose to engage with all commercial trade in toxic wastes. Our object—so far as possible—is not to allow dangerous cargoes to be transported in the first' place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want more specific information about the Government's timetable for conducting the discussions that are necessary to put pressure on other countries that are dumping their wastes and causing serious environmental problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware that before the hon. Lady took on her present position on the Opposition Front Bench, she was a member of the Opposition environmental team. the subject is close to her heart. I cannot add much to what I have already said. We are keen to take action. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has taken a forceful lead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Above all, it is essential that the disposal of any toxic wastes—throughout the world, not only the United Kingdom—is carried out safely and properly. At times, certain countries may not have the means to dispose of wastes safely. In those cases we must ensure that they are disposed of safely elsewhere—even if it means in this country. That is the critical point: disposal must be safe for the sake of the environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
The potential increase in transporting nuclear waste material was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Romsey and Waterside. Spent nuclear fuel is presently controlled by the INDG code. New standards for ships are being discussed presently at the IMO. As I said earlier, these are international issues. The problems can only be solved internationally. We shall make progress through the IMO.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Colvin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to deal with the issues about ReChem that were mentioned by the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North. I fully support what was said by my hon. Friend the Minister. If the process used by ReChem for the disposal of PCBs were unsafe, it should be stopped and the company prevented from using it. However, the truth is that the process is perfectly safe. It has been tested in my constituency and it is known to be safe, but it must be done properly. If incineration at 1,000 deg. C is not maintained for two-and-a half minutes, unfortunate by-products result from emissions. The process must be carried out properly. My constituents and I, who live around the ReChem plant, are happy when the process can be and is carried out properly. Yet there remains much public concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that explanation. There is little to add to it.
