	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Corporate Affairs (Mr. John Redwood)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That the Committee has considered the Financial Services Act 1986 (Extension of Scope of Act) Order 1991.</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the agreement of the Committee, it will be convenient to discuss at the same time the other order before us, namely the draft Financial Services Act 1986 (Delegation) (No. 2) Order 1991.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the draft Financial Services Act 1986 (Delegation) (No. 2) Order 1991—a catchy title, as always—is to transfer to the Securities and Investments Board the power to regulate investment and borrowing for certain types of authorised unit trusts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The power to make regulations dealing with the constitution and management of authorised unit trusts was transferred to the SIB in 1988. The Secretary of State retained the power—under section 81(2)(d)—to make regulations governing investment and borrowing powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In September 1990, I announced that the SIB would draft new, updated investment and borrowing powers regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SIB has consulted extensively. Copies of its final proposals, which were published last month, are available in the Library. I hope that the hon. Members have seen those. The SIB's draft regulations cover pricing and scheme particulars as well as investment and borrowing powers. They include detailed guidance on the investment objectives of the investment limits imposed on each category of fund. Funds will have more scope to employ efficient portfolio management and stocklending techniques as a result of these proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The categories of scheme subject to the delegation order include all the current categories of funds, and four new categories of funds; futures and option funds, geared futures and options funds, property funds and warrant funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the new categories of funds which will increase customer choice and enable managers to utilise the sophisticated facilities now available in the City of London to the benefit of a wider range of investors. The SIB has set out extensive investor protection requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft delegation order is submitted under section 114 of the 1986 Act. The Secretary of State is satisfied that the SIB is able and willing to discharge the functions being transferred and that its detailed proposals will afford investors adequate protection. The Secretary of State, in accordance with sections 121 and 122 of the Act, following a report by the Director-General of Fair Trading, is satisfied that there are no significant competition problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
The Financial Services Act 1986 (Extension of Scope of Act) Order 1991 extends the provisions of the Financial Services Act 1986 to building society deferred shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most building society shares are similar to interest bearing savings deposits and are repayable to the investors by the Society on demand or when the requirements are satisfied. Because such shares are deposits rather than risk bearing equity they are not regarded as investments under the Financial Services Act 1986. Investors are largely protected from the risk that they will not get their money back by the Building Societies Act 1986, and the attendant investor protection scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Deferred shares, in contrast, are a special type of building society share, originally used to capitalise new societies. The concept has now been extended to allow established societies to strengthen their capital position in the more competitive and risky market conditions that now exist and to give extra protection to their ordinary shareholders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such deferred shares will to all intents and purposes be risk bearing equity share capital but will not usually be repayable on demand. Investors in them and all other building society deferred shares should have protection under the Financial Services Act 1986.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the order will be that anyone carrying on an investment business in building society deferred shares, unless an exempt person, must be authorised by the Securities and Investments Board, a self-regulatory body or a recognised professional body and will be subject to rules made under the Financial Services Act 1986.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The orders offer welcome additional choice for customers and scope for financial businesses. I commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.34 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Marjorie Mowlam 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Redcar)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In relation to the first statutory instrument, I should like to emphasise one of the Minister's points. The order transfers to the Securities and Investments Board the powers to make regulations governing investing and borrowing for the specific instruments that already exist for authorised unit trusts. Security funds, money marketing funds, feeder funds and umbrella funds are already in the domain. The order provides for additional funds which will be granted authorised unit trust status. We are concerned about geared futures and options funds—the GFOFs—and warrant funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to outline our concern. The Minister said that extensive investor protection would be provided when the additional funds attain unit trust authorised status. We do not accept that; we believe that the new instruments will mean additional risks for investors, primarily because of the way that the Minister has introduced them. We are concerned not merely because GFOFs and warrant funds achieve unit trust status but because they have not been meshed at the same time with the marketing rules that the Life Assurance and Unit Regulatory Organisation is introducing. The instruments and the marketing mechanisms do not mesh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a distinct possibility that GFOFs and warrant funds can not only be sold in the retail market on the same basis as conventional units trusts but could be damaging to small investors who inadvertently take an imprudent risk, not understanding the higher volatility and risk associated with GFOFs. We are equally worried that the instruments
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0110">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
will create a contagious difficulty for the unit trust industry. Difficulties with GFOFs, because of their higher volatility, will reflect badly on the unit trust industry. Those are our concerns about two of the proposed instruments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, we do not understand why the Minister has introduced GFOFs and warrant funds under the collective instrument of unit trusts. Why do they have to be treated as unit trusts? Unit trusts diversify risks and have a very good public image. Why has not the Minister created GFOFs and warrant funds as separate entities, perhaps bracketing them with investment trusts? In some ways, that would be much better. The closest that we come to understanding why the Minister has done that is by looking at the SIB consultative document No. 49. The funds are at present offshore and unregulated. Why not bracket them with other investment trusts outside the unit trust industry?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 9 of the consultative document asks whether the unit trust is an appropriate vehicle for investment in derivatives. It poses the question clearly, and states that some concern was expressed in response to CP 37—an earlier SIB consultative document—about the appropriateness of the authorised unit trust regime as a vehicle for derivatives investment. It went on to the state that some respondents argued that futures and options could be highly volatile in price so that unit trusts investing in such instruments could be perceived as high risk, a perception which could be damaging to the reputation of the established unit trust industry. We share that worry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document stated that particular concern was expressed over the possibility of a futures and options unit trust incurring liabilities in excess of its assets and investors possibly losing all their investment, and that other respondents to the consultative paper argued that the unit trust was not the ideal vehicle for futures and options funds, but for a different reason—that closed-end funds or open-ended investment funds would be more appropriate vehicles for collective investments in these instruments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here is the crux of why it is going into unit trusts and not some other corporate vehicle for futures and options: the SIB believes that the arguments for the development for new corporate vehicles have considerable weight and deserve careful exploration. The SIB sympathises with the Opposition's argument. It goes on to say that at present the only vehicle available that offers a significant tax advantage for collective investment is the authorised unit trust. The SIB accordingly has proceeded to address the question of how this vehicle might best be adapted to enable new products to be developed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition go slightly further than that. It is not only a question of the present tax structure. The collective vehicles that are available are not regulated in the Financial Services Act 1986. If the Minister does not want to acknowledge the extent of the problems and confusion created by the Financial Services Act 1986, he must either stay with the unregulated offshore use of GFOFs or adopt his present option, which is the unit trust format. There is a middle road, but partly because of Inland Revenue pressure and because of the dog's breakfast of the Financial Services Act 1986, he has not been able to adopt it. We are now faced with a situation that will create great difficulty for the unit trust industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first problem was the risk to the investor; the second was the status of GFOFs and warrant funds within unit trusts because of the confusion created by the Government. The third problem arises from the way in which
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
negotiations have been carried out between Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation, the SIB and the Department of Trade and Industry. They have not been coordinated. That resulted in the ridiculous situation of the SIB having two consultative documents, Nos. 37 and 49, and LAUTRO starting its 10 days consultation on the marketing process on 19 April, while the SIB did not print its final proposals until 1 May 1991. There was one day on which the industry had both the final proposals in document form and the market mechanisms to apply them. When the SIB and LAUTRO clearly need to interface, how can they agree to particular instruments without knowing the market regulations that will be applied? They had one day in which to do it. We accept that LAUTRO is still in discussion. Yesterday afternoon and evening LAUTRO was discussing the regulations. I understand that on the marketing side LAUTRO will be able to continue to do that until June. To suggest that there has been a competent process of negotiation by the Minister and the Department of Trade and Industry is to go too far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Boothferry (Mr. Davis) is looking a little sleepy, let me give an example to illustrate my point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Davis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Boothferry) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Hon. Lady will put me to sleep.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Mowlam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not. I will help the hon. Gentleman considerably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take an example from the world of drugs. Drugs on the market differ according to whether they are sold over the counter or come by prescription. How can anyone rationally consider a statutory instrument such as this without knowing whether a drug can be bought over the counter of whether it is controlled, as higher-risk derivatives should be, by tighter prescription? That analogy shows that the procedures of negotiation and consultation that the Minister and his Department have undertaken are insufficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition do not have trouble with some aspects of the instruments. Most important is the scope provided by EPM—efficient portfolio management. The use of contracts and derivatives to reduce risks arising from, for example, the fluctuation of prices, interest rates and cash flow rather than leaving it solely to speculation, is a plus for the industry as a whole. That is not due to the Minister's actions; it originates in the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive, which permitted investment in contracts and derivatives provided that they were in the EPM format.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A lesser advantage is the scope in future and option funds. We have no objection to them as they stand. It is the GFOFs and the warrants that cause us most anxiety. I go so far as to say that there are advantages in EPM as a sensible financial technique which will improve the quality of the service to the investor. It will enable a conventional fund manager to reduce uncertainty. We welcome that. The unit trust industry sees advantages in the EPM structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It cannot be said that the Opposition are making life difficult for the futures and options market. The futures and options market is an important part of the City of London. We acknowledge that it must be supported as competition with the MATIF and the Deutsche Terminborse increases as we move towards the single market. We do not want to make life difficult for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0111">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
There is no reason why the instruments must involve the unit trust format. Other vehicles can be used which would not have a negative effect on the future and options derivatives industry and would be a plus for it as we approach 1992 and beyond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are four matters on which I should like the Minister to expatiate. The first is the initial outlay of the GFOFs. As I understand it, the proportion of GFOF as initial outlay, which is the amount that can be invested in margins on future contracts or on premiums on options, was initially set by SIB at 10 per cent. That means that a minimum of 90 per cent. of the fund would be available for direct investment, securities, liquid assets and so on. The final resolution is 20 per cent. In France, Luxembourg and America, initial outlay margins are higher. It will not be enough for the Minister to point that out in his response. What worries me is not solely the raising of the limit of the initial outlay margin to 20 per cent. but doing that at the same time as removing the rules on diversification. The combination of the two will cause problems with the introduction of the GFOFs. If the limit is raised to 20 per cent. and there are no limits on diversification, volatility will increase and present difficulties for the investor. As a result, the investor will be more exposed to individual incompetence or malice. The GFOFs market regime—that is, the LAUTRO rules that are still under discussion—should take that into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the SIB's initial CP 49 document, which is what the industry thought it was going to receive before the final document was introduced in May and which was considered for the market rules, it suggested that no more than 2 per cent. of the total value of the fund should be devoted to initial outlay for any single derivative contract and that no more than 4 per cent. of the total value of the fund should be devoted to any single category of derivative contract. That could be shares, commodities, or anything like that. There were limits on diversification which provided a balance against the initial outlay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the final document that we were given on 1 May, the SIB states that regulations have removed these diversification rules entirely, replacing them with a simple requirement that the fund manager should ensure that investment in derivatives is suitably diversified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>indicated assent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Mowlam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister nods. The phrase "suitably diversified" has created so much difficulty since regulations and rules have been introduced because of other provisions of the Financial Services Act 1986. I do not want to question the hon. Gentleman in the short time remaining to him as a Minister on the difficulties that such phrases create. That relaxation must be viewed in conjunction with the initial outlay limit. We shall be very worried unless there is a focus on initial outlay or diversification, or unless the LAUTRO rules, which are currently under negotiation, take into account the higher risk and volatility that will result from relaxations in the structure of the instrument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third aspect on which I wish to focus is commodities. The SIB regulations will permit the geared futures and options funds to invest in derivatives based on the commodities market—cocoa futures, for example. The prices of commodity derivatives are notoriously difficult to predict. As we know, Keynes made and lost a fortune in commodity derivatives. The final SIB regulations do not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
retain any requirement for funds to diversify their initial outlay into different types of derivative contracts. It is therefore possible within the rules for a GFOF to hold the full 20 per cent. in commodities contracts with the attendant risks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In America, which has greater experience in this matter than the United Kingdom, the Securities and Exchange Commission does not permit mutual funds to invest in commodities derivatives. If an individual wishes to do so, it can be done in partnership. If that option has been adopted in the United States, why can it not be considered here?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be useful for both right hon. and hon. Members and the unit trust industry if the Minister clarified the position with regard to liability in the event of a GFOF insolvency. The SIB regulations state that in no circumstances will an investor in a GFOF stand to lose more than his or her initial investment. The difficulty is that the gearing effect of trading on the margin means that price movements in the underlying asset have a disproportionate effect, much like the gearing problems with the poll tax. Variation in the underlying price could lead to the investor owing more on a derivative contract than his or her initial outlay. In extremis, the whole fund could cost more than the initial outlay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who is responsible for the GFOF's liabilities in such circumstances? I understand that the SIB has decided against setting up a special fund to cover eventual insolvency, remote as the Minister will tell us that such a possibility is. Are the trustees or the fund manager responsible, or is there a joint indemnity between them? Who will pick up the pieces in the event of insolvency?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is going into great detail about the SIB regulations. However, we are discussing whether we trust the SIB to do the job and whether to delegate the powers to it. I hope that the hon. Lady will speak on that point and tell the Committee whether she so dislikes the SIB's work that she does not trust it and does not want to give it those powers. That is the proper issue for debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Mowlam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not QED, because the Minister can do what he has done in the past and delegate the powers to the SIB, leaving it to pick up the pieces afterwards. We have only to think of Polly Peck and the difficulties at Audley Street—should it be the Department of Trade and Industry, the Serious Fraud Office or the Securities and Investments Board that acts?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been buck passing par excellence. All the Minister does is to delegate powers to the SIB. When we question him, he says that the powers belong to the SIB. We shall not let the Minister get away with arguing that it is a matter of whether we trust the SIB's competence to implement the statutory instrument. The SIB's competence is dependent on what the Minister delegates it to do. If what the Minister gives the SIB to do is irrational, illogical and difficult to implement in the context of the LAUTRO marketing rules, it is the job of the Opposition and this Committee to question not the SIB's competence but the Minister's competence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has not yet questioned the competence of the Department of Trade and Industry. Every issue that she has raised relates to proposed regulations and rules that have been drawn up by the SIB, not the Department of Trade and Industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Mowlam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The regulations and rules that we are discussing were drawn up by the SIB. The order transfers an enabling power to the SIB. The powers are not at present the SIB's responsibility but that of the Minister. I question the nature of the enabling powers that the Minister is transferring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SIB drew up the rules in the same way that LAUTRO drew up the marketing rules. That self-regulatory organisation has a non-statutory relationship to the SIB and the SIB has a statutory relationship to the Minister. We could discuss next steps executive agents and the independence of the SIB, but when we consider a statutory instrument the Minister should not body swerve and avoid the argument by saying that the problem is the SIB's because it drew up the rules while the Minister only gave it the power. That is a stunning abdication of responsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond to the hon. Lady's points at the end of the debate, but the Committee should not have its time wasted. The issue is whether the Committee trusts the SIB to do the job. The proposals are the SIB's. Many of the marketing rules that the hon. Lady questioned are under delegated powers already approved by the House and in the domain of the SIB and LAUTRO. The hon. Lady must understand that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Mowlam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that clearly. It is not for the Minister to define the issue before the Committee. We are dealing with a particular statutory instrument. In his opening remarks, the Minister failed to mention the competence of the SIB. He said that the order was to transfer to the SIB the power to make regulations governing investment and borrowing. He then outlined the different powers. I am discussing, and shall continue to discuss, the statutory instrument in great detail. That is not wasting the Committee's time, it is valuable. It is our responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the powers of the SIB and LAUTRO over marketing have already been agreed and devolved to LAUTRO. We have marketing rules that LAUTRO, as the regulatory body, operates through particular financial instruments. The Minister argues that those rules are no longer to be discussed because they have already been delegated. The Minister is delegating a new financial instrument involving unit trusts, especially the geared futures and options funds and warrant funds, but saying that the status quo applies to everything else. That is clearly not so. The attitude of the industry and many of those who will have to settle under the regime is that one cannot divorce the instrument from the marketing regulations. If that were possible, why should LAUTRO bother to consider changing the rules? If the instrument and the marketing regulations are so divorced and the LAUTRO regulations are so fixed, why is there a problem? Why did LAUTRO meet for the whole of yesterday afternoon? Why was it given an extension to continue discussing the marketing rules because of the problems associated with the order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The lady must deal with three major problems: whether cold calling on established customers should be allowed; risk, and the problem of warning potential investors that they could lose the whole of their investment; and advertising warning potential customers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Interventions should be brief. The hon. Gentleman has exceeded my time limit for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Mowlam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Lancashire, West (Mr. Hind) made a valid point. I shall deal with his three problems to facilitate the work of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cold calling has caused problems for the industry in respect both of unit trusts and geared futures and options funds and more generally, and its introduction was opposed by the Consumers Association and others. The hon. Member for Lancashire, West will remember 	<i>The Mail on Sunday's</i> graphic description of the problems of Allied Dunbar, the halo effect and the difficulties of cold calling. In an article by Robert Miller in 	<i>The Observer,</i> Tony Fraher, managing director of Morgan Grenfell's unit trusts, is quoted as saying:
	<br><q><p>	<i>"The Observer</i> is absolutely right to highlight the dangers of geared futures and options funds.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>On paper, cold calling is prohibited. In reality, as the regulators know from their experiences of the past few years, prohibition doesn't stop it happening."</p></q>
We have not only the extent of the problem, but a clear view from people in the industry that cold calling continues despite regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the same article, the SIB says that cold calling is not a problem because it is prohibited for geared futures on and options funds and warrant funds, although it is permitted for futures and options funds and property funds. The SIB is not living in the real world by pretending that the problem does not exist. The hon. Member for Lancashire, West will realise that cold calling in respect of GFOFs is permitted only when a customer has expressed an interest. A customer must express an interest before a GFOF can be mentioned. A rule based on expressing an interest is unenforceable. I am not interested in unenforceable, unpoliceable regulations. The present cold calling regulation for GFOFs will not work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the SIB's cold calling regulations for other financial instruments, it is possible to mention an instrument on the basis of a person having applied for a similar instrument in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0113">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
the past. As GFOFS are new to unit trust holders, that cannot be a prerequisite for being cold called. The LAUTRO document says:
	<br><q><p>"Where appropriate, it must be explained that there is a possibility that an investor may lose all or a substantial part of his money."</p></q>
That was the second point that the hon. Member for Lancashire, West, made. Is the phrase "where appropriate" sufficient for the degree of risk and volatility involved? If those selling GFOFs do not think it appropriate, can they ignore that provision? The laxity in the rules regarding cold calling and the risk factor causes the Opposition and many people in the industry great anxiety. Such weaknesses in the marketing regulations bring into disrepute the unit trust industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third point of the hon. Member for Lancashire, West, was about advertising. I understand that the advertising for GFOFs is category C advertising because LAUTRO did not consider necessary trailer advertising—adverts that require one to write for further information if interested. GFOFs will be sold under category C advertising, which is basically clip-a-coupon advertising. In other words, if one clips a coupon out of a newspaper and sends it off, one is committed to the GFOF.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are serious problems with the marketing rules and regulations for all three areas mentioned by the hon. Member for Lancashire, West. However, the Minister has created the position that he wants. He says that we are here only to discuss the statutory instrument and the validity of SIB's competence to implement it. We are actually debating the interface between a statutory instrument that puts a burden on the unit trust industry and GFOFs, which would potentially call into disrepute many of their other products, and a set of marketing regulations that LAUTRO has not yet finalised. As is evident from the three marketing areas outlined by the hon. Member for Lancashire, West, and from the difficulties that I outlined between the initial outlay and the diversification, there are problems with the nature of the instrument and also with the marketing rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I want to re-emphasise that we do not oppose FOFs, which have advantages. We believe that EPM will help the unit trust industry. However, we are worried about the nature of investor protection as GFOFs are to be put on the market. In his press release of 30th April, the Minister said:
	<br><q><p>"The provisions for the new categories of funds are designed to increase customer choice without detracting from investor protection."</p></q>
He is alone in believing that that does not detract from investor protection, as is evident from Mr. Edwards, a joint managing director of Sabre Fund Management, who is reported in the Daily 	<i>Telegraph</i> of 11th May as saying:
	<br><q><p>"'I do not believe it will be all good. There will be some bad mistakes made as people choose the wrong manager'."</p></q>
If such pressure is on the individual manager because of the difficulties in the structure of the statutory instrument and the nature of market regulations, it is incumbent on the Minister to think again about what he is proposing this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
diffident. I am a novice in City matters and, despite my rotund appearance, have not courted the City. Therefore, I cannot speak with the fluency of the hon. Member for Redcar (Ms. Mowlam) who has obviously spent considerable time in banking parlours and fund managers' suites. My remarks are directed towards the draft Financial Services Act 1986 (Delegation) (No. 2) Order 1991 and the geared futures options funds, with which I am familiar only at arm's length.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Minister made clear, the order deals with the delegation to SIB of responsibility for the regulations governing the product and its marketing. Those regulatory powers were formerly in the hands of the Minister's Department; the order will allow them to be delegated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sympathise with the Opposition's argument that, before we agree to that delegation, we should examine the manner in which it is exercised. We should consider the product and how it is marketed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On geared futures options funds, I understand that the SIB originally insisted that not more than 10 per cent. of any fund should be put into such options and that there should be diversification. That relates to the purpose of unit trusts, which is a spread of risk. The proposal of 20 per cent. with no diversification would mean a significant accumulation of risk, especially as we are considering geared funds, in which the margin is the initial investment and the outturn can be significantly enhanced either upwards or downwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A minor point, was not mentioned in the comprehensive review by the Opposition, is who will pick up the tab should things go wrong. I quote from a letter from Miss Colette Bowe—her names may strike a chord with some—in her new capacity. She states:
	<br><q><p>"It is the manager or trustee, or a third party, who would be responsible for any excess of liabilities over assets."</p></q>
I hope that the Minister will say which of those parties will be liable, and who might be the third party if it is not the trustee or the manager and —we hope by definition—is not the investor. No doubt the minister will clarify the issue in his usual confident and competent manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The marketing of the product is under the LAUTRO regulation, rather than that of the SIB. We should reconsider the matter of cold calling following what was said to be an expression of interest. Unwisely, I expressed an interest in the electricity privatisation and ended up with 100 shares, having made a modest application for shares in my regional company. Outsiders were allocated far more than I was and I have been landed with a sum that I cannot trade. Health warnings are appropriate even when the risk is not as great as that envisaged in the geared funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the difficulties involved in regulating cold calling. If it is impossible to do so, that reinforces the need for a health warning in the instrument. People have come to regard the unit trust as a measure for spreading risk and of being comparatively free from the effect of violent swing's. In the case of the geared futures options funds, a warning would be in order, even if it is impossible for LAUTRO to be more precise about marketing regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite his evident approval of the SIB and LAUTRO and his wish to wash his hands of his regulatory powers, I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will give the Committee some comfort on the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Great Grimsby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The brilliant exposition of my hon. Friend the Member for Redcar (Ms. Mowlam) said it all. She mobilised the mastery of the information for which she is famous. The Minister's languid superiority in his approach cuts no ice considering the display of concern by the industry and the public. The Minister's demeanour is very appropriate for cold calling. I am cold calling now and faced at the door by the Minister's languid superiority, I always come away feeling humbled and intellectually inferior. However, the hon. Gentleman's approach is not good enough on a matter of such widespread concern when his own ranks in the Committee—members of Committees are hand picked for their bodies, not their brains—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Governments like brute votes in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, the other side is not picked very well, Dame Janet. I congratulate the hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Sir H. Miller) on his intellectual and educational antecedents. He is one of a dying breed in the Conservative party, where the garagistes and arrivistes are taking over. The hon. Gentleman has clearly utilised his ability to develop real concerns, as demonstrated in his intervention in my hon. Friend's speech. There are real concerns from the Minister's own Back Benchers, and my hon. Friend has put those concerns to the hon. Gentleman with characteristic force. I envy the mastery of information: I am confused by GFOFs and FOFs—I thought that they were greetings by electors to canvassers at the door during election periods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned with the reputation of the unit trust industry which has performed a valuable service in diminishing risks and increasing the spread, coverage and safety of investment. The industry has made investment in unit trusts widely available through advertising and an institutional sales approach which has attracted a whole new section of the public to investment in industry and business. The unit trust industry has probably done more to widen shareholding than all the Government's privatisation measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unit trusts provide a safe way for the small investor to invest. We are introducing into that known, trusted and respected—one might almost say revered—institution a wholly new category which is different and riskier. The unit trusts spread risk and make the institutions safer. This proposal introduces a new area of speculation. The problem is the motivation, for doing that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand why the City, facing intensified competition and being anxious to preserve its priority, wants to widen the base of investment in speculative areas. Foisting them on the consumer is an effective way of tapping a new market and broadening that base. The financial sectors must decide how to attract suckers to the speculative areas that are much riskier than anything that the unit trust industry has tackled before. The unit trust industry offers itself as an appropriate vehicle for a sector looking for a new market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
Consultative paper No. 49 issued by the SIB states that there are dangers involved and asks whether it is appropriate that the unit trust industry should take this step. However, it concludes that at present, the only vehicle that offers significant tax advantages for collective investment is the authorised unit trusts. The SIB accordingly has proceeded to address the question of how this vehicle might best be adapted to enable new products to develop. In other words, the financial sector wants to flog off more products and involve more people in speculation, while the poor old unit trusts have expertise and wide contacts and a good reputation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The financial sector decides, "Ah! Let's foist it on that lot. We can get tax advantages; we've got a new marketing force and a whole range of investment opportunities." As my hon. Friend said, highly speculative investment and unit trusts do not mesh together well. We might as well use public transport to collect alcoholics and junkies as well as fare-paying passengers. We could decide that, as we have to trust public transport, we should use it for another purpose, which distorts and discredits its original purpose, changes its image and affects its reputation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are considering an important issue—the contributions made by unit trusts. I have some worries about management charges, but they are not relevant to today's debate and I shall mention them only briefly. Management charges have been edged up by unit trusts. We shall enter a period of economic permafrost, especially if the Government remain in power. That will lead to an increasing propensity to churn portfolios. The dramatic gains of the speculative boom of the Lawson era will not be available in the economic climate of the 1990s. Management charges will become increasingly important. They should be controlled and regulated. However, I shall leave that matter as it is not relevant to today's discussions. I am sure that you, Dame Janet, will stop me if I pursue it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I mention it only in passing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reputation of the unit trust industry should not be invoked as a cloak to cover speculative investment, which will be sold through the same channels, by the same techniques and share the same image. Unit trusts are designed to increase coverage and protect the investor. Speculative investment will put money at risk in a way that unit trusts would not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The approach is wrong. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Redcar will give the order to the serried ranks behind her to vote against the iniquitous measure. I shall answer the call—I am eager to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not understand what the Minister said about deferred shares in building societies. As I am the Committee's cold caller, I shall develop my ignorance. The Minister seems to wish to allow deferred shares to be marketed. When I served on the Committee, which considered the Bill that became the Building Societies Act 1986, I was worried about turning building societies from mutual into financial institutions. Only one building society has gone to market. That was a sufficiently messy procedure to deter others. Is the measure another erosion of the mutuality of building societies? The Opposition are anxious about that, because we support the mutual commitment of building societies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
I conclude with a general point. The Department of Trade and Industry had power to make regulations. As my hon. Friend said, consultation on the regulations was not very adequate. The institutional structure is a dog's breakfast. The Minister is a great delegator. He enjoys being able to say, "This iniquity must be tackled. Accountants must be taken in hand. The investor is at risk." He also likes to say, "It is very good of you to come, and I all know about it, but these are not my powers and responsibilities. I have handed over all that." His is a totally hands-off approach. The institutional pattern that has developed from the Financial Services Act 1986 is inadequately based—it was when we passed it. It needed the same sort of independent base as the SEC in the United States. It is chaotic. Creaking weaknesses are emerging, as is revealed by consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, on the fifth anniversary of the passing of the Act, the Minister will consider the case for an inquiry into the workings of the system. I like the Minister's assurance that all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds, especially with him as Minister. It is interesting playing intellectual chess with him, even if I always lose. There is widespread anxiety about the functioning of the insititutions, and there should be a broad inquiry into how effective and successful the institutional framework developed by the Act has been.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.25 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Hind 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lancashire, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Until the mid-1970s I had two things in common with the majority of the parliamentary Labour party: first, I was a polytechnic lecturer and, second, I did not know very much about the world. Since then I have changed careers. I have turned my back on my company and legal lectureship at Leeds polytechnic down the road from where the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) worked for Yorkshire Television at the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister faces a difficulty. He is inviting us to do something which is logical and sensible, and that is to transfer the regulation of the GFOFs and warrant funds to the SIB and LAUTRO. We take issue not with that but with the rules that LAUTRO has established for the regulation of that part of the market. Our comments need to be directed at LAUTRO, and I expect LAUTRO to take note of what the Committee says.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I pointed out to the hon. Member for Redcar (Ms. Mowlam), the issue of coldcalling in the LAUTRO regulations which will flow from the statutory instrument is vital. What is an established customer? Effectively, an established customer could be called cold by someone selling these types of investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has rightly been said, the expression of interest test is another problem. It is impossible to police. I say that as a barrister with 15 years experience in enforcing the law. Any law that is incapable of enforcement is a bad law. This one is fatally flawed. At the end of the day, it will come down to an argument between the cold-called investor and the salesman over whether interest was expressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to build in more protection. LAUTRO needs to consider cooling off. At what stage should the cold-called customer and others back off from the sale? The Unit Trust Association has come up with the sensible idea that an investor should be able to state a minimum stock loss price
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
at which, if it occurred during the cooling off period, the manager would be required to close out the deal. The purchaser of the investment would be protected from loss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the question of risk, which the hon. Member for Redcar (Ms. Mowlam) raised. Potential purchasers who go to a well-established unit trust with a good reputation and an investment portfolio based on diversification could lose all their money through investment in GFOFs and warrant funds. That possibility must be dealt with by suitable warnings for potential customers. People must realise that GFOFs and warrant funds are not ordinary unit trust investments because they do not have the diversification normally associated with unit trusts. LAUTRO should tackle that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third problem is advertising. At present, class C advertisements are involved. I accept all that has been said on the subject. That matter, too, must be dealt with. All agreements should, as suggested in 	<i>The Sunday Times,</i> carry a warning to purchasers that they could lose all their money and that such investments are not ordinary unit trusts. If the Committee did not set out those warnings, we should be failing in our duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Sir H. Miller) said, it would be foolish to increase from 10 per cent. to 20 per cent. the risk that may be carried. The risk should be kept down to the 10 per cent. of the original SIB proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If those considerations are carried from this Committee to LAUTRO by my hon. Friend the Minister, we shall have done our duty. It must be made clear that if LAUTRO is not prepared to accept the views and reservations of parliamentary Committees to ensure that investors are fully protected, no further powers will be devolved from parliamentary Committees. We are given a sovereign trust to ensure that investors are protected. We must fulfil our responsibility. The principle behind the statutory instrument is right, but there are real reservations to be dealt with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.32 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee has spent most of its time on the critical issues of cold calling and investor protection in respect of GFOFs and warrant funds. As to the SIB has made clear in the press recently, no cold calling will be allowed for GFOFs and warrant funds. My hon. Friend the Member for Lancashire, West (Mr. Hind) pointed out the need for precise definition of cold calling and of what sort of client contact is permissible. I shall ensure that the Committee's views are represented to LAUTRO while it prepares its final version of the regulations. The higher volatility that the funds that we are discussing could have will be stressed. That is clear from the LAUTRO consultation document, which states:
	<br><q><p>"In the case of GFOFs and WFs, clear information should be given to investors concerning the potential volatility of the fund. Clear explanations must be given as to why there may be considerable swings in unit prices. Where appropriate, it must be explained that there is a possibility that an investor may lose all or a substantial part of his money."</p></q>
That is a strong wealth warning. The reason for use of the term "where appropriate" is that it is possible to imagine a manager wanting to sell a GFOF while clearly following rules of diversification so that the risk involved was not materially greater than for other sorts of fund. If the manager could satisfy the regulator about that, it would be reasonable for the manager to issue appropriate warnings
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0116">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
as to the level of risk that his fund was running rather than having to use the severe warning about the possibility of people losing all their money, if such an eventuality was unlikely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady suggested that I as a Minister wished to introduce the new types of funds. That is not what the order does, nor what I intend. I am inviting the Committee to approve powers for the SIB and LAUTRO so that they can allow the market to produce such funds if it so chooses. The production of such funds will require managers, who will be regulated, to come forward with an idea and persuade customers to invest, subject to the strong marketing rules that LAUTRO set out in its consultation document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Redcar (Ms. Mowlam) asked why investment trusts were not the right vehicle for such investments and why unit trusts were being offered. I do not know what the marketplace will want to do, or how many will come forward and offer GFOFs as unit trusts, but we should not stop them doing that because unit funds are different in kind from investment trusts. They allow investors to apply and for new units to be created, or for investors to withdraw their money and the units to be cancelled at a value related to the asset value of the underlying fund. Investment trusts are closed zone funds with tradeable shares. They carry an additional or different risk from unit funds in that the shares of the trust may not sell at a figure close to asset value—at times there may be a discount or a premium—which can cause additional volatility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not prevent people from using the new instruments available in the derivative markets through unit trusts if they wish to do so. The hon. Lady concedes that for efficient portfolio management purposes, but the definition of EPM could cause problems. We are talking about a spectrum of risks rather than one category, which is clearly EPM, and another category where, in the hon. Lady's view, the risk is unreasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady must accept that the debate is about whether we trust the SIB and LAUTRO to carry out the functions that we are delegating to them. She must also accept that some functions that we have debated are already their proper functions. I have already promised that a full report or our debate will be sent to LAUTRO and to the SIB so that they are aware of the strong views expressed on two or three crucial issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked what would happen if the GFOF went bust, and my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Sir H. Miller) wanted to know who would be liable. I cannot answet that question; it would depend on the legal documents, the form of trustee and the way in which the fund has been constructed. However, I can repeat the assurance of the Securities and Investments Board that no investor will be liable for more than his stake money. That, above all else, is what matters to the Committee. The question of who is liable if the fund extended itself beyond its resources is a matter for the fund and the professional market operators who would be its counterparties in those transactions. That is a matter for the private law of contract and not for the Committee. It will be settled in the normal way as a matter of private contract law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady suggests that I am alone in thinking that investor protection will not be worsened by the proposals. That cannot be so, because the SIB and LAUTRO have put out the consultation documents. They are happy with the regulations that they propose, so I can speak on their behalf
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
in this respect as well as on behalf of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and the Government. Many others have written in response to the consultation documents and said that they are happy with all or most of the regulatory regime set out in those documents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must stress that allowing people the opportunity to offer the public new funds creates the possibility of new risks. I shall not take the line that the hon. Lady suggested and tell the Committee that there is nothing in these new types of funds that poses different risks from those in existing funds. Of course there are risks. It would be possible to use the gearing from the derivative management in the geared financial and futures fund to create a much racier product. After all, that is the idea of it. That is why it is important that there should be comprehensive warnings before people buy, which is exactly what LAUTRO sets out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is saying that if we are unhappy with this racier investment being available, we should vote against the principle of conceding the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where did the pressure for this racier type of investment come from? It certainly did not come from the unit trust industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some in the City would like to have the opportunity to run funds under these provisions. But I cannot tell the hon. Gentleman how many may want to do so or whether they would want them to be highly geared by using all the scope of the derivatives that they are allowed to buy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman should also remember that the controls on the funds still contain some important clauses that may reassure some members of the Committee. For example, the SIB regulations state:
	<br><q><p>"the manager must exercise reasonable prudence in relation to the diversification of the property of the scheme so far is it is devoted to intitial outlay in respect of derivatives other than derivatives which by their nature are already broadly diversified (as, for instance, with derivatives transactions related to a broadly based index)."</p></q>
There is another control so that the funds will be less geared, by the use of derivatives, than some of the competitor funds in other countries, as the hon. Lady suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also an absolute prohibition on borrowing for these funds so that people cannot gear in two ways—they cannot leverage by borrowing more money and leverage by using the full scope of the initial investment in margin. Protection of the kind that the Committee is seeking does exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) told me that there was widespread concern about the measure—so widespread, indeed, that he is the only Opposition Member to turn up to debate the issue in Committee, apart from the hon. Lady who, of course, had to be here, although I am sure that she is delighted to attend. That does not seem to represent the widespread concern that the hon. Gentleman is suggesting exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we read the Official Report, we shall see that the hon. Member for Great Grimsby was a little misleading when he said that unit trusts were safe. Unit trusts run risks just as other investment products do. As with the new funds, the risks of an individual unit trust may be different from the population as a whole. People diversify and choose different types of investment. Some unit trusts
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0117">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
concentrate their risks more than others. That is up to the marketplace. People can choose how to invest. They need proper advice and, where appropriate, warnings on the nature of unit funds. I am sure that the hon. Member for Great Grimsby will agree that people who invested all their money in a unit trust buying underlying securities in a single volatile market which then fell would be likely to lose quite a bit of money. But that is a risk that the investors and their advisers should have taken into account when deciding to buy that particular unit trust product.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certain types of GFOF products may carry considerably higher risks than the typical unit trust product. Others may be tailored to have similar or lower risk because they concentrate more on using derivatives to reduce risk rather than to increase it. All that we should insist on—and I think that the SIB and LAUTRO will insist on it—is clear labelling and proper advice where necessary to those who may be considering buying these products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I began to think that the hon. Member for Great Grimsby just did not like new products. He spoke about transport. Had he been around some years earlier, he might have told the House that the motorbus was far too dangerous and that we should carry on using horse-drawn vehicles. That is the spirit that the hon. Gentleman seems to encourage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the City of London will continue to be in the lead when it comes to innovative and creative products and investment techniques worldwide. This measure is a small way of enabling it to do so, which will, in consequence widen customer choice and the way in which people can have the best that is on offer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Great Grimsby also asked me whether the other order was a further way of eroding mutuality. The prime purpose of that order is to allow the creation of a new kind of capital which will then be marketed as he describes. The instruments will be interest bearing so they would not have a lean on the profits—they would not have rising dividends if the building society was particularly successful. Conversely, if the building society got into trouble—unlikely though that is—there would be risk for those types of securities because the holders would discover that they ranked lower in any insolvency proceedings, which would presumably be reflected" in the securities' interest and market pricing arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I described in my opening remarks, the main difference is that this product is not a building society deposit that can be made one day and drawn out the next. It becomes a tradeable instrument, and whoever takes it on must be aware of the arrangements for resale and what that might do to the investment. The product's characteristics require it to be under the Financial Services Act 1986, unlike ordinary building society deposits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The anxieties of my hon. Friends and the hon. Lady about cold calling and the exact definition of suitable warnings will be passed to LAUTRO and the SIB. I have every confidence that they will do a good job. I welcome the new funds. There will be some modestly geared derivative funds as a result of the proposals which will add to customer choice. I am pleased to commend the instrument to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Mowlam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take up the Minister's last point? He said that he understood the anxiety expressed by his hon. Friends and the hon. Lady and would pass them to LAUTRO and the SIB. He said that he had every confidence that they would do a good job. The views expressed are not mutually exclusive. They have been expressed by Opposition Members and by the hon. Members for Lancashire, West (Mr. Hind) and for Bromsgrove (Sir H. Miller). Will the Minister add his weight to the argument presented to LAUTRO and the SIB, by saying that anxieties are common to both sides of the Committee? We are all concerned about the clarity with which the risk is stated on the policies—that is, about cold calling and about advertising.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister writes to LAUTRO and the SIB about the rules, will he ask for simplification of some paragraphs in the LAUTRO regulations? Appendix B, paragraph 2.04(ii), which relates to warrant funds, states:
	<br><q><p>"The policies which the operator of the scheme for the time being adopts or proposes to adopt in selecting the investments in which the fund of the scheme will be invested are such that investment in warrants is likely to take place to such an extent that movements in the value of the property to which the warrants relate are likely to cause a significantly amplified movement in the prices at which units in the scheme are issued and redeemed".</p></q>
I have read that paragraph several times and I find it difficult to understand. I am sure that other hon. Members have equal difficulty. It would help our consideration of regulations for the industry if such points were simplified and clarified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to the racier forms of investment. He said that he was unclear who was developing them, apart from some people in the City who expressed an interest in developing those options. The pressure is on because those in the futures options market in Europe, especially in Paris and Frankfurt, make no secret of their worries about liquidity and demand. The solution, as my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) said, is not to encumber the unit trust industry with difficulties to avoid the problems created by the FSA, as the Minister is doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister skirted a point that was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby about greater participation in different products. In the past 12 years, the Government have tried harder than most to increase participation. Privatisation giveaways are the classic method. Have they succeeded? The short answer is no. If we consider the extent of share ownership—I am sorry that the Minister is bored. It is the Oppositions right to debate and discuss the issues. It may be tedious for someone of the Minister's intellectual competence, but that is something that the Minister must bear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is 8·5 to 9 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Mowlam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be 9 million, but if the hon. Gentleman looks at the figures—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Mowlam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Lancashire, West said from a sedentary position that the figure was 9 million. That is no bigger than the 1979 figure, in terms of depth of ownership during the 10 years—[	<i>Laughter.</i>] I am sorry that Conservative Members find that so funny.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Their laughter is forced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Mowlam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is forced. I shall make the point even clearer, as Conservative Members are obviously having trouble with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A comparison between 1979 and the present day must omit the giveaway privatisations which, as the hon. Member for Bromsgrove pointed out, anybody in his or her right mind would have accepted because they were so cheap. Having made that adjustment, one finds that the amount of institutional ownership in shares is great than it was in 1979. If the hon. Member for Bromsgrove disagrees with that analysis, I shall provide him with the figures afterwards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady should not be confused by the figures. The amount of institutional ownership has risen, but the value and volume of share ownerhip by private individuals has also grown massively. The hon. Lady does not understand what is happening in the world if she does not acknowledge that. Both figures have grown colossally, thanks to the wealth and enterprise generated by Conservative policies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Mowlam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that I am not in touch with reality, but, given the depth of the recession and the economic difficulties faced by people today, his argument shows that his own grasp of reality is extremely tenuous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the hon. Lady and the Committee that we cannot embark on a general economic debate. We are discusssing specific regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Mowlam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take that point completely, Dame Janet. I was merely responding to the Minister's statement that all was rosy in the economic garden. Many people would disagree with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
However, I do not retract what I said about the breadth and depth of share ownership once privatisation is removed from the analysis. If we want greater participation in corporate Government, unit trusts historically have been the mechanism by which the risk can be spread, as the hon. Member for Bromsgrove said. Our worry is that if GFOFs and other high-risk, volatile instruments are put in unit trusts, the exact opposite of what industry, the City and Members of Parliament want—that is, greater stability and greater sense of corporate Government—will be achieved. That is why the Opposition will not only vote against the statutory instrument this morning but will oppose it again when it returns to the House for affirmation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
