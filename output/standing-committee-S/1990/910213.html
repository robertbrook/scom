	<section>
	<div class='legislation'>TRAFFIC AREAS (REORGANISATION) ORDER 1990</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Roads and Traffic (Mr. Christopher Chope)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That the Committee has considered the Traffic Areas (Reorganisation) Order 1990.</p></q>
The object of the order is to reduce the number of traffic areas from nine to eight, redrawing the boundaries where necessary. Subject to the approval of both Houses, the changes will take effect on 1 June 1991, or two months after approval, whichever is the later. The changes are part of a reorganisation of work that involves the closure of the traffic area offices in Newcastle, Nottingham and London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cumbria has been omitted from Schedule 1 of the order. That is an oversight, correction of which will require a separate order. I hope that the Committee will agree that the order is a sensible reform.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.31 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Joan Ruddick 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lewisham, Deptford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister suggested that we should regard the order as a sensible measure. In part—we do, but there are some issues on which the Minister should comment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Traffic commissioners and their offices have operated since the 1930s. Vehicle licensing is the mechanism to control the excesses of unlicenced operators and ensure a standard of safety on our roads. The system has worked well, partly because of the strong regional organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are pleased that the Government have decided to retain the strong regional base for the operations of the traffic commissioners, despite the recommendations of the Palmer report, on which the order is based. I have received representations from several bodies, including the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, the Transport and General Workers Union and the National Union of Civil and Public Servants, stressing the importance of the local aspect of the reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Operators and drivers can at present visit their regional offices to obtain advice on how best to complete the forms that they must use to apply for or change their operating licences. They appreciate not having to travel far to deal with inquiries from the traffic commissioners. Anxiety has been expressed about the proposed closure of some offices. It is not strictly necessary for people to visit an office in person, but that personal contact is valued by operators. Traffic area offices receive several personal callers every day. Problems will arise for London operators who will have to travel to Eastbourne to obtain such advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed closure of the Newcastle office has caused especial anxiety and is strongly opposed by the Tyne and Wear passenger transport authority, the passenger transport executive and several metropolitan district councils in the area. they are worried about accessibility.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
Under the proposals, some conurbations, such as that in the north-east, will be remote from an area office. The authorities there do not believe that it will be possible to run the same efficient operators' licensing service that existed in the past. The creation of a divisional office in Newcastle has been suggested. What consideration has been given to that suggestion?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has the Minister considered personal callers? The Department has already closed the Aberdeen office and transferred all Scottish business to the Edinburgh office. How has that change affected the work load and the number of personal callers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As always, the Government claim that such a reorganisation will save money. What calculations have been made? Will the operators' licensing fee be adjusted? That fee is linked to the total turnover of the income of area offices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the Departments proposals for staff at the offices? Will staff be redeployed, or will some be made redundant?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reorganisation offers an opportunity to re-examine and improve the role of the traffic commissioners. During our consideration of the Road Traffic Bill, we discussed impounding vehicles. The Opposition supported measures that provided for impounding vehicles for an imprisonable offence. A power to impound vehicles used in fly-tipping exists in the private Member's Bill that I introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The traffic commissioners are very worried about unlicensed vehicles. The traffic commissioner of the metropolitan area, which will soon be abolished, said in a report in 1989;
	<br><q><p>"There are still many people operating lorries within my area who do not have an 'O' licence. And several others who continue operating with impunity, despite having had their licenses removed. There is a need for a concerted effort to deal with illegal operators."</p></q>
In 1989, that commissioner arranged a check on 5,500 vehicles in the east end of London. It showed that almost 10 per cent. did not display operators' licenses. Subsequent checks in another area showed that 30 per cent. of vehicles operated illegally. Illegal operation is a massive problem in London. Can the Minister assure that Committee that the abolition of the metropolitan traffic area office will not curtail checks on vehicles that operate illegally and are a danger to everyone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Spearing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I apologise to you, Mr. Howells and to my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, Deptford (Ms. Ruddock) for arriving a minute after she had begun to speak. My hon. Friend referred to the abolition of the metropolitan traffic area office, but the order merely refers to changing that area. Does the Minister intend to close the office that deals with the metropolitan area and Greater London and transfer those functions to the south coast? The order makes no such legal requirement. It is an administrative option.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) for his important intervention. The purpose of our debate is to elicit from the Minister his intentions and the reasons behind them. I am informed that he intends the Eastbourne office to tackle the problems now covered by the metropolitan traffic area office. We believe that that will inconvenience operators and will not benefit society by curbing the illegal operations to which I have already referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0347">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
A traffic commissioner located in Eastbourne will not be as well informed about or sensitive to the considerable problems posed by illegal operators in the metropolitan area. I hope that the Minister will consider what further action should be taken to prevent the continued existence of illegal operators. As the Minister will know, the responsible sector of the industry, to which most operators belong, is pressing hard for more action to be taken against the cowboys. Unlicensed vehicles are often dangerous, and unlicensed operators frequently engage in illegal activities, such as fly-tipping. I hope that the Minister will say how the Government will compensate for the way in which the reorganisation may undermine some of the activities of the enforcement authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also serious anxiety about the effects of reorganisation on traffic commissioners' responsibilities in relation to bus operators. The Palmer report, to which I have already referred, noted that a number of organisations, including the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, were worried that the commissioners do not conduct any systematic monitoring of registered bus services. The report made it clear that at present the traffic commissioners use their powers in relation to operators who fail to run bus services according to the registered details lodged under the Transport Act 1985 only when serious and substantial complaints of failure to run registered services are brought to their notice. The AMA considers that the public has a right to expect that the provisions of the Transport Act 1985 are efficiently and effectively implemented and policed. The spirit of the relevant provisions in sections 6 and 111 of that Act are that operators are required to run bus services in accordance with registered particulars, and that the responsibility for enforcing that requirement rests with the traffic commissioners. However, unlike other legislation, the 1985 Act contains no requirement that action should only be taken in response to a specific complaint. The commissioners can and should act without a specific complaint being brought to their notice. It would also be appropriate for them to monitor registered bus services systematically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, is the Minister content with the traffic commissioners' current performance in relation to the policing of the operation of bus services under the 1985 Act? What steps, if any, does he plan to take to improve that performance? There is a real anxiety that the requirement that the traffic commissioners should cover large areas without a commensurate increase in staff will mean that the information about bus registrations that they supply to local authorities will become even less timely than at present, and that the commissioners' resources for monitoring bus services and dealing with complaints will be even more stretched.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not apologise, Mr. Howells, for taking the Committee's time this morning, as I believe that the proposed reorganisation will have a significant deleterious effect on the policing of unlicensed vehicles and the monitoring of bus services. Moreover, operators and authorities are worried that the planned reorganisation will undermine the services carried out by the traffic commissioners in the area offices. I look forward to the Minister's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
	<p>10.44 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to deal with the hon. Lady's questions reasonably succinctly, beginning with the matter of public access. The transfer to the Department's executive agencies of responsibility for vocational driver licensing and driver test bookings means that there will be less need for the public to have access to the traffic area offices. Obviously, some operators will prefer to deal face to face with the office staff and will be prepared to visit the offices in person to sort out their problems. The great mass business is handled by post, telephone or fax, and it is unreasonable to suppose that we could have an office in every densely populated area so that people could go there in person on the off chance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister know the breakdown of figures between those who go in person to an office to apply for an operator's license or have been called in to deal with an inquiry raised by the commissioners, and those who apply—as he rightly says—for a driver's licence? Drivers' licences are issued by the DVLC driver and vehicle licencing centre but it is queries arising from operators' applications and variations to licences that bring people into the office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We accepted the need to retain offices in areas where there are many operators. That was taken into account when considering the future structure of traffic areas. The hon. Lady is anxious about our decision to move the office out of London. It is part of the Government's policy, of which I thought that the Opposition approved, to remove some administrative activities from London to other areas. Eastbourne is an appropriate area for additional office employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the Minister's point on office employment. However, is he suggesting that Eastbourne is more convenient than London or that there are more operators functioning close to Eastbourne than in central London?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not saying that. Few operators will want to pay a visit to the office. If they wish to do so, I can commend a visit to Eastbourne, having been at school there, as a worthwhile day out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is not responding satisfactorily. Has the Minister any figures of the number of callers? Has there been an analysis of who goes to the offices and why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there are any figures, I shall ensure that the hon. Lady receives them. The level of fees to be charged in future for operators' licences will take into account of the restructuring savings. Those savings will amount to some £600,000 a year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister say whether that will lead to a reduction in the operators' licence fee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot say that. The cost of the enforcement burden must be met. That is crucial. The hon. Lady has said that there should be more enforcement. That must be paid for. It is financed through the operators' licence fee. I cannot assure the Committee that there will be a reduction in that fee as a result of the reorganisation, but there will be better value for money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0348">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister suggesting that the savings of 1600,000 will be ploughed back into the service to obtain better enforcement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The savings will be used productively and that will involve extra work on enforcement, on which we have a very good record. Over the past two years the number of goods vehicles weighed by traffic examiners has increased by 50 per cent; the number of tachographs checked has risen by more than 65 per cent. Such results demonstrate the success of the traffic examiners in meeting our commitment to enforce traffic legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gwyneth Dunwoody 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Crewe and Nantwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Cheshire and the counties bordering the M6 have had problems with foreign lorries. Is the Minister satisfied that the full co-operation of the county police forces is being obtained? The monitoring of heavy goods vehicles can be done only with their co-operation, but if they are overstretched—as many of them are—such monitoring will be low on their list of priorities, however much they want to help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one considers the road accident figures and the effect on our motorways of increasing traffic, which sometimes amounts to road trains without the benefit of computer control, it becomes obvious that there must be action against lorries that do not comply with British rules. Is the Minister happy that under the new arrangements there will be sufficient money, support staff and co-operation with the police forces to ensure that that problem is monitored in future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that any of the matters to which the hon. Lady referred will be adversely affected by the reorganisation. The Government will continue to be committed to improving the levels of enforcement, which includes imposing our rules on foreign-owned vehicles. I can certainly give that assurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister give any relevant figures?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a limit to the number of figures that I can hold in my head at any one time. I gave some such figures during the Committee stage of the Road Traffic Bill from where the hon. Member for Lewisham, Deptford (Ms. Ruddock) and I have freshly come. The hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) may wish to refer to the 	<i>Official Report</i> of the proceedings of that Committee and study the figures set out there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) said that much of the order deals with administrative arrangements. I assure the Committee that we have had extensive consultation and are happy that the administrative reorganisation will improve the service for the customer. I hope that the Committee will accept the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked the Minister about the effect of closing the Aberdeen office and transferring business to Edinburgh. I should be grateful if the Minister responded to that question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have details about the transfer of business from Aberdeen to Edinburgh, but I can advise the hon. Lady in writing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also asked how the Department had dealt with the suggestion of a divisional office in Newcastle and what would happen to the staff from the reorganised offices.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A sub-office in Newcastle would be an unnecessary duplication of effort. The vast majority of hauliers are based in and around the Leeds conurbation where we are keeping an office. Newcastle will benefit from the relocation of the driving standards agency from Leeds, the object of which was to provide for the redeployment of staff. It is hoped that there will be no compulsory redundancies as a result of the reorganisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.52 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This order is an example of the way in which the House of Commons should work, because, as far as I can ascertain, it has no party-political or philosophical content. In principle, it should not have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about a little-known service provided by traffic commissioners which has existed since mechanical vehicles appeared. The public rely on it a great deal. An enormous amount of public attention has recently been paid to safety and we rely on the traditions, skills and operations of traffic commissioners to maintain the efficiency and mechanical probity of goods vehicles. I think that the licensing of heavy goods vehicles and their drivers comes within the ambit of traffic commissioners—it used to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The skills and standards of heavy goods vehicle drivers are important to all motorists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order also deals with the standard of maintenance of public service vehicles. Bus and coach services have been reorganised to some extent during the past few years and comments have been made about their standards. It also deals with the testing of public service licence holders. I think that that is also a function of the traffic commissioners. Those functions and personnel are critical to public safety, which the House has sought to promote for more than a century—even since the President of the Board of Trade, Mr. Huskisson, was killed at the opening of the Liverpool to Manchester railway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Public safety has a lot to do with the order. Where else in the United Kingdom is there a greater density of goods vehicles, public transport vehicles, such as coaches and buses, and drivers than in and around Greater London?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I first read the order, I was unclear about its purpose. The explanatory memorandum—I often comment about their inadequacy in statutory instruments—was too brief. It seems to say that the metropolitan traffic area should be abolished—effectively merged with the existing south-eastern traffic area—and called the south-eastern and metropolitan traffic area. Logically, it should have been called the metropolitan and south-eastern traffic area—the Minister may wish to comment on that. Surely the density of operations is greater in the metropolis than in the rest of the south-eastern home counties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to discern which parts of the existing metropolitan traffic area outside Greater London will not be included in the new area. I have scanned the order and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0349">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
the explanatory memorandum, but I cannot find a definition of the precise area to be transferred. The nearest I came to finding such a definition in the order was:
	<br><q><p>"In accordance with paragraph (5), the greater part of the area which that Area comprises shall become part of the area of the traffic area known at the date of the making of this Order as the South-Eastern Traffic Area and the rest shall become part of the Eastern Traffic Area."</p></q>
The order does not explain what "the rest" is—in other words, which part of the existing metropolitan traffic area will be transferred to the eastern traffic area whose headquarters are probably in Norwich or Ipswich. Precisely where are those headquarters? Will the Minister explain exactly what "the rest" is? A simple diagram in the explanatory memorandum would have been helpful—that suggestion should be taken up by future Governments of whichever party. We are dealing with yet another break up of coherent services within the metropolitan area. I shall not refer in detail to recent changes in local government, but, yet again, London services, which have long proved to be functional, are to be "merged". In fact, it goes further than that because we know from the Minister and from the researches of my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, Deptford (Ms. Ruddock) that the headquarters are to be transferred to Eastbourne.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made a personal reference to Eastbourne, and so shall I. Forty years ago this year, I was employed by His Majesty the King in the forces. I had to visit a regimental pay office of a certain army corp in Eastbourne. It was conveniently placed. The office dealt by post with regiments all over the world—through teleprinters, mail and so on. It gave employment to the good people of Eastbourne and was effectively in communication with places around the world. In those days, we had people in the far east, and heaven knows where but unlike me, they had no immediate functional responsibilites. I was a pay officer who doled out pay to my troops every week and that had to be done where the troops were located.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What functions do traffic commissioners perform that are of a geographical nature? The Minister dismissed the statement made by my hon. Friend the Member for Deptford by saying that operators may call in on the off-chance. The Minister may be right: they could go to Eastbourne if they wanted an interview and perhaps there could be a branch office here to which operators could come, but that is not the importance of geographical location.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) spoke about what happens in her constituency and the Minister mentioned tachograph inspections. Surely they are taken from the vehicle, or are they sent by post. Either way, garages are involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Inspections of lorries in east London were also mentioned. I represent a constituency that probably has, or had, one of the highest densities of transport contractors in all London. Those contractors write to me about transport matters. Historically, east London is London's transport depot, because the port is there. There are many good and not-so-good operators in east London. Inspections are done on the road and at the depots. Surely it is necessary to send operators to depots on behalf of the traffic commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the function will be hived off. Will people travel on season tickets or roar up from Eastbourne in cars to perform those functions? If the Minister has to answer a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
question about the inspection of vehicles, including passenger vehicles, and he initiates a spot check, will it be necessary for staff to flood in from Eastbourne.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Thompson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Calder Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman began by saying that the issue was not party political, but there are other divisions in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people in the provinces suffer and abhor laws that are made to regulate London. Why does it always seem twice as far from Eastbourne to London as it seems from London to Eastbourne?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order, Mr. Howells. I am astonished that the hon. Gentleman should refer to Yorkshire as part of the provinces. Has a sea change taken place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not quite follow the logic of the hon. Gentleman's intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is because the hon. Gentleman lives in London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One point often escapes those who live in Scotland, Wales and Yorkshire, I appreciate that Yorkshire is a sub-nation. When they say that many decisions are taken in London, they mean that a decision affecting Yorkshire and elsewhere is taken by representatives of the rest of the United Kingdom. Because a decision is taken in London it does not mean that those who represent London make that decision. That is why we are a united kingdom. Surely it is common sense to have traffic commissioners in London at the centre of operations where the vehicles and personnel are located.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman misses my point, accidentally, I am sure. There are too many rules, regulations and laws to run London that we in the provinces have to bear. Too much of our law is London-based. Laws are designed for a big metropolis, but we in the outlying districts must also comply with them. The hon. Member for Newham, South may disagree but he has probably never been to the provinces since he was Paymaster General.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I never aspired to that, or to any other office in Government. I was a pay officer in a regiment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the reaction of the hon. Member for Calder Valley (Mr. Thompson), but does he understand that West Ham resents what Westminster does just as much as west Yorkshire? It is not a matter of whether statutes suit London, but, I hope, whether they suit the nation. The hon. Gentleman has got it wrong —we are not referring to the merits of the law in connection with the standards of vehicles, but to a rearrangement that need not involve a change of headquarters. However, we have discovered that the Minister intends to change those headquarters once the order is passed. Given the nature of the work load of the traffic commissioners surely it would be logical to close the Eastbourne office or combine it with another. I would not advocate that, but there should be some commonsense dispersal of the work. Perhaps there could be an office in Dover as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is the London office to be closed? Am I right to say that it is the Sloane Square area? Is that site owned by the Government? Is it a former Department of Transport office?

How are we to achieve an annual economy of £600,000, or does that money represent a single capital saving? My hon. Friend the Member for Deptford has already asked how such savings will be achieved without any reduction in the quality of service and protection for the people on the road in and around the metropolis. The Minister has taken us beyond the terms of the statutory instruments and he must answer those questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that there had been extensive consultation. My hon. Friend the Minister for Deptford has already referred to a number of issues raised as a result of that consultation. Have those issues reached the Department, and, if so, what replies have been sent? Has the Minister taken account of them?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we can continue a bipartisan approach to good administration. The Minister has had plenty of experience of local government in London—some of us have shared that experience. I hope that he agrees that to maintain good local government of our traffic and of the drivers of heavy goods vehicles, buses and coaches—on the whole they are expert and efficient drivers—in London, there must be appropriate back up. The case for removing the centre of such activity from London to the south coast has still to be made, because, so far the arguments appear to be all to the contrary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gwyneth Dunwoody 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Crewe and Nantwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reorganisation of the bus companies in Britain has not led to an improved service in the rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency we have grave difficulties with the provision of a proper bus service. There is considerable evidence that the timetables are not being adhered to and that those people working for the bus company are under considerable pressure. Inevitably, there will be occassions when we will need the support of the traffic commissioners. I join with my hon. Friends in paying tribute to the work that they have done over the years to help to protect those who use public transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The House is good at making rules for public transport, usually on the basis of total ignorance of how it works. It is the female of the species, not the male who stands in a snowstorm with two small children waiting for a bus that is an hour late. There must be close monitoring of how those public services work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been in the House long enough to be worried by low-key examinations of subjects that appear esoteric and simple. We are told that the order is only concerned with a reorganisation that will be to everybody's benefit and save money. I partially support my hon. Friends from the metropolis but I am not enamoured of the idea that everything should be centred in London—there are other, more important, parts of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The budget of the traffic commissioners worries me. Their offices need adequate budgets and staff to grant licences—which is becoming more politically sensitive—monitor bus services and deal with the problems, in some areas, with HGV licences. A high level of care cannot be produced without sufficient people to do the job. The Minister should state clearly that this "saving" will not impinge on staff numbers, the budgets of individual traffic
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
commissioners and their offices or their work, which is important for public safety and the improvement of road facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The removal of offices from one place to another is emotionally difficult for the people involved but it is not fundamental. It is fundamental that the work of protecting road users is properly funded and performed by a sufficient number of civil servants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had the pleasure to serve on the same Transport Bill Committee as the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody). She predicted disaster when the buses were deregulated. Today's buses are part of a thriving competitive industry organised to meet customers' needs. Compare that with the industry of four years ago—50-odd years of state control and regulation has led to strangulation and rising costs and subsidies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been an immeasurable improvement in regional bus services. Bus mileage increased by 19 per cent. in 1989–90, 83 per cent. of which was run up by operators on a purely commercial basis. Bus operating costs have decreased by 30 per cent. per vehicle mile and local authority subsidies have been more than halved between 1985–86 and 1989–90. Deregulation encouraged innovations such as the minibus, which many transport authorities had claimed would be inappropriate to their areas. There are now more than 8,000 minibuses with up to 16 seats providing bus users in more than 600 places with fast and efficient services, often to locations to which larger buses cannot gain access. I am delighted that the honourable Lady gave me the opportunity to remind the Committee how successful bus deregulation has been.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will recall that no one doubted that he was trying to reduce the amount of money spent on bus transport. Minibus services were already being provided before the Transport Act 1985. People are increasingly discovering that minibuses do not stand up to long running and many need to be replaced. Luckily, we do not need to argue about it because in many rural constituencies people will show with their votes what they think of the quality of the reorganisation of bus services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government are proud to be judged on the success of deregulation in the rural areas. There have been a number of demands that the same deregulation should be extended to London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will live to regret that final remark. Opposition Members are not aware of any pressure of demands to extend deregulation to London, which would be a political disaster. I suspect that the Government will not have the nerve to do it. Any fool can increase the mileage by letting anybody run a bus anywhere, but the number of people using buses has fallen dramatically since deregulation. People do not think much of the services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not correct. There has been a substantial reduction in the rate of decrease in the use of buses by passengers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is well known that the number of people using buses declined steadily in the past 15 or 20 years. However, the Government's deregulation measures have improved the quality of bus services in both rural and metropolitan areas. The rate of reduction in passenger use has slowed to the extent that it has almost levelled off. The bus has become a more attractive form of transport with the introduction and development of new vehicles and routes that are more in keeping with consumers' wishes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Powell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Corby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What my hon. Friend the Minister has just said will strike a chord with my constituents who live in a large rural area and have experienced all the benefits that he has described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that corroboration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) asked several questions. I can tell him that the London office is situated in Charles house in Kensington high street, where about 110 civil servants are employed on traffic area work. They will be released for other duties as a result of the reorganisation. That will be of great benefit and will not affect enforcement in the London area, which is carried out by people who do not sit behind desks in offices. It will not affect the Department's ability to provide statistics, as all the traffic area office statistics are centralised in Bristol.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reorganisation will cause the western traffic area to be extended to include Oxfordshire, Berkshire, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. The eastern traffic area will lose Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire to the north-eastern and north-western areas, but will be extended south and west to include Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire and Essex. The remainder of the present south-eastern area will be combined with the remainder of the present metropolitan area to form a new traffic area consisting of London, Sussex, Surrey and Kent. I am sorry if I did not make that clear earlier, but I tried to keep my opening remarks as brief as possible to allow time for hon. Members to ask questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have been able to allay anxiety about the reorganisation's effect on the quality of service. The reorganisation will reduce administrative costs and bureaucracy, thereby ensuring better value for money. It will not result in less adequate levels of enforcement, nor will it reduce the effectiveness of the commissioners, most of whom have to travel around taking public inquiries on the question of proposed operating centres. Frankly, it does not matter whether their desks are in Eastbourne or London, although it is obviously less expensive to site their main office and support staff in Eastbourne. The change will help us to make continuing savings as a result of lower rental costs and the ability to recruit clerical labour at a lower wage rate than in the metropolis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am finding it hard to understand how £600,000 will be saved when the office is not being physically closed, people are simply being released from their present duties. We are told then that will not lead to a diminution in services, but the Minister claims that there will be on-going savings as a result. Surely there cannot be that much discrepancy between wage rates of civil servants in London and in Eastbourne. What are the 110 people doing now that they will not do in the future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are at present working for the traffic area office in Kensington. When they are no longer needed after reorganisation, they will be redeployed. The costs incurred for the space that they occupy in Charles house will be paid for by other Departments that still need office space in London. When I was responsible for the Property Services Agency, rental charges in Charles house—part of the Government estate—were not among the highest but they are significantly higher than in Eastbourne. There will be a direct saving therefore in releasing that office accommodation for other Departments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will additional staff be engaged to work in Eastbourne to cover all the tasks currently undertaken in the London office?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a result of concurrent changes—the transfer of some responsibilities to the vehicle inspectorate and driving standards agency—the intended reduction of staff in Eastbourne from 65 to 35 will no longer obtain. Area reorganisation will mean that Eastbourne staff will remain at 65.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that information. Enforcement staff—not desk-bound by nature—must have some central depot or base from which operations are conducted. I deplore inefficient and unnecessary bureaucracy, but the Minister would surely agree that effective enforcement of anything requires administrative back up. "Efficient" administration is always done by "us"; bureaucracy is always practised by "them"—those on the other side who we do not like. Can the Minister assure me that the number of enforcement personnel in greater London will not be diminished? From what headquarters will they operate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already given assurances about enforcement, which will be carried out where it is needed. As the hon. Gentleman knows, there are many heavy goods vehicles in London. The last word on whether the change will be administratively advantageous should rest with the traffic commissioners. They were consulted and all agreed that the proposed new structure would meet the changing needs of the traffic area organisation and that the new boundaries would introduce a greater degree of consistency in respective work loads. The reorganisation is a popular move with the traffic commissioners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister know the figures for the current turnover of existing offices? We need that information to make a judgment about his predicted savings of £600,000. The Minister has not made it sufficiently clear whether there will be compulsory redundancies. I think that the Minister said that it was hoped that there would not be, but the question is vital and I hope that the Minister can be more specific.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not got the answer to the hon. Lady's first question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to the question of compulsory redundancies, civil servants are never made compulsorily redundant provided that they accept a reasonable offer of alternative employment. They are very rarely made compulsorily redundant.
