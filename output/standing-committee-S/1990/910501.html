	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed.</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Data Protection Registration Fee Order 1991.—[	<i>Mr. Greg Knight.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. John Patten)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To my surprise and delight, I find myself here this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stuart Randall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kingston upon Hull, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir John. I should be grateful if you would confirm whether my hon. Friend the Member for Neath (Mr. Hain), who has recently been elected a Member of Parliament, is eligible to participate in the Committee's proceedings. Perhaps you could check your list to see whether my hon. Friend is entitled to vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Frankly, I do not see the point of that intervention. The hon. Member for Neath (Mr. Hain) is clearly on my list of members of the Committee. Therefore, no point of order can possibly arise in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir John. Perhaps you could confirm that all right hon. and hon. Members in the Committee are here on a legitimate basis. I am sure that you will agree that, under the rules governing Committees, those who attend, speak and vote in such proceedings must have been selected to do so by various mechanisms. I should be grateful if you would confirm that the constitution of the Committee is in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that everything is in order. It is possible for any hon. Member to attend a Standing Committee and take part in the deliberations on a statutory instrument, but he cannot unless he is a member of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patten</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is good to see so many of my hon. Friends in Committee this morning, and it is good to see the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall) and his new colleague the hon. Member for Neath (Mr. Hain), whom we welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Committee approves the order, the Government will lay regulations under the Data Protection Act 1984—the relevant legislation for such purposes—to increase the registration fee for users under the Act to £75. Our overall aim is to balance costs and income over the life of the registrar's office between 1984 and 1996. We shall continue to keep the fees under review with that objective in mind. Therefore, the order paves the way for us to satisfy our obligations under the Data Protection Act 1984 to match income and expenditure more closely. I commend the motion to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
	<p>10.33 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I read the order, I did not understand it. I must record my great displeasure because I do not believe that we can conduct a proper debate in Committee because of the way in which the order is worded. Its drafting is dreadful. I refer the Committee to schedule 2(1), which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In relation to the functions mentioned in paragraph (2) below the costs of which fall to be taken into account on the exercise of the powers to fix the fees to which paragraph (3) below applies, the following matter, namely, any deficit incurred before the exercise of the relevant power, is hereby specified for the purposes of section 102(4) of the Finance (No. 2) Act 1987 as one which may be taken into account in determining those costs."</p></blockquote>
I should be grateful if any member of the Committee could explain what that means. It is a disgrace to the House that we are still producing stuff written along those lines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dame Jill Knight 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Edgbaston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it always the case that everything on which the hon. Gentleman votes is crystal clear in his extremely able legal mind?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not a lawyer; I trained to be an engineer. I must be careful not to misquote the Minister, but I recall that he has always advocated the use of plain language in legislation, and he is absolutely right to do so. I do not understand how the Minister can make such declarations yet allow such junk to be considered by the Committee. It is time that we put our affairs in proper order. I note that Conservative Members are nodding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us get to the heart of the Matter. The Minister gave a rather—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Powell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Corby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says, "Clear"—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Crystal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now, the hon. Gentleman says, "Crystal". Perhaps he can answer some of my questions. We believe that registration is important, and I do not believe that there is any dispute in the Committee about that. We are discussing the use and abuse of information contained on computer—not on private files but on data files. We must ensure that it is protected, and the key to that is to ensure that people register. The legislation was introduced in, I think, 1985. Its track record shows that, at the beginning, registration was not very good. That was due partly to the fact that the procedures were clumsy and bureaucratic, especially for small businesses which were deterred from registering. Again, we should credit the Government for using their influence to encourage the improvement of procedures. The hon. Member for Torridge and Devon, West (Miss Nicholson) is about to leap into the air. Although it was commendable for the Government to act in that way, they now have it completely wrong. The original fee was just over £20—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Patten</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Twenty-two.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, £22. The Minister earlier mentioned £75. Clearly, The Home Office is bowing again to Treasury rules and trying to recover all the costs. We could argue—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did not my hon. Friend the Minister make it clear—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0096">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member has not given way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way, but I believe that hon. Members should not intervene until their interventions have been accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Gentleman's rebuke in the spirit in which it was given. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that when my right hon. Friend the Minister outlined the reasons for the measure, he said that it had nothing to do with Treasury rules, but that it was laid down in an Act of Parliament that there must be a balance in the funds? The Committee is being asked not to agree to a Treasury rule about which we know nothing, but to fulfil an Act of Parliament that was passed in 1984.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is usually pretty sharp on financial matters. He takes an interest in them, and we have sat together on committees considering Finance Bills—you, Sir John, may have chaired one of those committees. However, the hon Gentleman's argument is utterly flawed. It hinges on the fact that there must be an interpretation of what was likely to be the registration rate. I cannot understand the badly worded instrument, but I think that it has something to do with the fact that estimates were made. The hon Gentleman knows that, in working out the fee based on the estimate, one can make the estimate whatever one likes. The hon gentleman's argument has been shot down in flames, and he has crashed solidly into the ground. That is the end of the hon Member for Corby.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Emma Nicholson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torridge and Devon, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has shown that he was right to be worried about the make-up of the Committee, because the weight of experience and knowledge on the subject under discussion is on this side of the Committee. Indeed, to say that something to do with electronic data transfer, access and distribution has crashed in flames shows the inadequacy of the hon. Gentlemans knowledge. It is a last century statement. This is a superb instrument, and it is exquisitely drafted—it must have been written by a computer, with no human intervention. The hon. Gentleman will know that the new EC draft directive on data protection, being produced by Brussels, is superbly suited to endless debate in the House of Commons. It will take us years to put right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a disgraceful abuse of privilege. The hon. Member for Torridge and Devon, West is talking about EC directives, and I had not even referred to them. I was discussing the point made by the hon. Member for Corby. Such matters are not set in concrete in legislation and the hon. Gentleman was quite wrong. What comes out of the EC is quite irrelevant and if I were to refer to it unduly without drawing the right sort of parallel, you, Sir John, would rule me out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Patten</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While I agree that the hon. Gentleman might be straying beyond thae bounds of order to debate the European directive, surely he is aware of its existence and knows that it is to be debated in the House as shortly as on 15 May. The hon. Gentleman is leading for the Opposition, so I am sure that he is aware of the interrelationship pointed out by my hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and Devon, West (Miss Nicholson).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of the directive and its consequences for British legislation. We are debating an order that hinges on recovering charges, and as a result there will be an enormous registration fee. That is wrong because it is essential that we encourage as many people as possible to register. It would have been possible to set a figure that was not as high as £75. There would be ways to write off capital and start-up costs and to ensure that there was an appropriate write-off period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Home Office Minister could have found ways to include such a provision, but instead he decided to introduce an order, under powers laid down in statute, that will have a seriously deleterious effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dame Jill Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not wish the machine to go into deficit. Is he saying that he does not object to an increase, but is merely questioning its size?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give a specific answer by example. With regard to start-up costs, I have to read between the lines—but I sense what has happened. When the organisation was set up, estimates were used to determine a fee of £22. It now appears that those estimates were wrong. I have no problems about that because it was a new organisation and we did not know what the rate would be. Office and other capital and revenue costs were associated with the new organisation. Over what period have the capital costs been written off? Is the Minister, satisfied that it is long enough? If the period could have been extended, the proposed increase in the registration figure could have been reduced. I need those details fully to answer the question asked by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Egbaston (Dame J. Knight). I should be grateful if the Minister would tell the Committee the period over which the start-up costs are being written off to arrive at the figure of £75.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Patten</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I will answer the question. As always, I shall try to help the hon. Gentleman with matters that confuse him. The aim of the order is to ensure that income and expenditure balance in the period between 1985 and 1996. To borrow a phrase from my right hon. and noble Friend the Leader of the House of Lords, that is as plain as a pikestaff.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister, in a rather patronising way, said that I was confused. Sometimes I am confused, and I happily admit it, but the Minister has failed to give us the facts. He does not understand them himself. Part of the calculation includes a write-off period. What the Minister said about balancing the books is irrelevant because, according to Home Office policy, the books are not being balanced; that sum is probably being written off over a nine or 12-year period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Patten</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Twelve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that it is 12. The Government are not balancing the books; the sum is being written off. It probably cost £2 million or £3 million to set up the organisation. I do not suggest this as a matter of policy—I merely give it as an illustration—but why not write off the capital cost over 15 years. That would make a significant improvement to the registration fee. Why has the Minister gone for a high-cost registration as a means of balancing the books?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0097">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Patten</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, I greatly like him. When an hon. Member has been opposite another hon. Gentleman for the best part of four years, he either likes him or hates him. The hon. Gentleman falls into former rather than the latter category. We wish to ensure that the start-up and other costs of the 12 years up to 1966 are met by those who use the data, especially the substantial commercial users of data such as credit bureaux, ICI, motor traders and so on. Why should not they pay the full cost of a registration fee of £75, as will be proposed under the order which follows this instrument? Even accounting for the year-on-year fluctuations in registration, that will ensure that the proper cost is met by those commercial organisations that use the information, rather than it being met by the taxpayer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There we are, Mr. Hunt—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I apologise, Sir John; after our many years on telecommunications and other Bills, the name rolled off the tongue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Neil Macfarlane 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sutton and Cheam)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am satisfied with the instrument before us. My right hon. Friend the Minister has shown that it is succinct and crystal clear. However, I am curious about one thing. The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall) clearly has before him his joining instructions. I am anxious to know precisely what the document is to which he keeps referring. It might be to the Committee's benefit if we had sight of it. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will come clean and tell us what motivates him on this matter. It might benefit the Committee and you, Sir John, if the hon. Gentleman established a direct dialogue with the Minister. That frequent reference to his joining instructions is causing much curiousity among Conservative Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some call it cunning, not curiousity. My hon. Friend's and I do our homework; we talk around the subject, as all good politicians do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Patten</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the hon. Gentleman quoting from?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The document that I have is the statutory instrument before us. What the Minister said does not reflect his knowledge of what is going on in the Home Office. I understand that in December 1990, an interdepartmental committee was set up to review the Act. The committee recommended that registration should be abolished and that the costs should be met from public funds. Will the Minister tell the Committee the true position? Clearly, that major issue affects the costs and, as the Minister rightly said, the European directive is imminent. What is the status of that committee's recommendation? Will it be adopted as Home Office policy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Patten</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The report of that committee was telling and, in many ways, highly consistent with the Government's successful policy of deregulation and not putting onerous burdens on businesses unnecessarily. At the same time, the draft European directive—to which my hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and Devon, West referred, and which will be debated in European Standing Committee B on 15 May—includes new recommendations about the control and use of information. It seems sensible to await that debate and decision by the House before
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
responding in a practical sense to the recommendations of that committee. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not want us to do anything else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that the Minister could have given a fuller explanation, even if no final decision has been made. To start with, the Minister seemed warm to the recommendation that we should abolish fees and introduce Exchequer funding. He put that in the context of deregulation and of not having onerous burdens on businesses. Frankly, I cannot see that that is anything to do with the matter. Whether funds come from fees or from the Exchequer is besides the point. A cost will still be incurred because of the Treasury's policy of recovery. There is confusion about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What assumptions have the Government made about inflation? The proposed increase of £75, plus the complicated forms, will especially affect small private users. What about the small one-man band window cleaning business on the other side of the river, which lists its clients by computer? As the computer contains names and addresses, that man will have to register. Is that what we want to do? It could be argued that even our private computers containing recipes from our friends should be registered. We are obliged to do so by law, especially if such recipes are passed around. Should a fee be paid for such innocuous uses of data?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raise such questions because we need a full debate on the matter and the Committee is limited to the question of fees. Of course, the Minister said that there will be a new order—presumably, an EEC order—which will, I hope, provide us with an opportunity to raise broader matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Emma Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be concerned if bulletin board exchanges—what the hon. Gentleman meant when he talked of exchanging recipes—fell under the current Act, but they do not and so the hon. Gentleman has nothing to fear. He can exchange ways of making bread, puddings or anything he likes without coming under that Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Minister is right to say that there will be opportunities—we all hope—for debate on the new European draft directive. As the current Act is derived from the first European draft directive, and, as the United Kingdom puts no value on information and has no law on personal privacy, our Act is different from those in other European member states. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that there is great scope for debate, although it is difficult to see how we can bring into the United Kingdom the concept of personal privacy or value of information, which will inevitably lead our legislation to be very dissimilar to that of the other European member states.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady raises an interesting point, which I welcome as such matters need to be discussed. The Labour party has debated and discussed personal privacy and it has a policy on the subject, having merged the various bits—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The debate is going far too wide. We have gone from puddings, to window cleaning, to European documents, yet there is nothing in the draft order that refers to those matters. I hope that the debate will remain relevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You know that I always take your advice and strictures very seriously, Sir John. Without challenging your ruling in any way, I must say that not only has there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0098">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
been a substantial increase in the fees charged to those who register, but there could be another significant increase when other European legislation is introduced. That is what we are worried about and we believe that the Government have failed again to come up with a decent policy. They have shown that they do not care about small businesses by humping on so many additional charges, on top of the uniform business rate and all the other problems facing small businesses at present. The Opposition would have preferred a discreet and more careful consideration of the way in which costs would be written off to minimise the costs of registration. Registration is extremely important and should be encouraged. In a free society, proper data protection legislation is essential.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.58 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cohen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leyton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with all that was said, by hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall), who made some very good points—not least about the dreadful drafting of the Order. It is interesting that the fee of £75 does not appear in it. I have some sympathy with the Minister because he has been so tied up with the Criminal Justice Bill, the War Crimes Bill, and so on that he has not had much time to give proper thought to data protection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It shows.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Patten</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a personal attack.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it is not; it is an appreciation of the right hon. Gentleman's busy work load. However, it would be remiss of us not to suggest that he re-examines the matter, especially the £75 fee. I do not want small businesses to have to shoulder that unnecessary burden. My hon. Friend was right to refer to window cleaners—all sorts of small businesses will have to register. Of course, it is not only businesses that will be affected—other small computer users such as schools will be caught by the order, and they will have to pay a great deal more than £75. There will be a sapping effect on the privacy safeguards contained in the Data Protection Act 1984.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order is symptomatic of the Government's halfhearted and dismissive approach to data protection generally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Emma Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Data Protection Act 1984 is concerned not with the privacy of individuals, but with the accuracy of the personal data that are stored on electronic media. We have not accepted the concept of privacy rights in the United Kingdom, so the Data Protection Act 1984 is not about the protection of personal privacy; it deals only with the accuracy of data and with a person's ability to gain access so that corrections may be made. The hon. Gentleman's statement—the premise on which he has based his thinking—is therefore mistaken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We cannot embark on a wide debate on the 1984 Act. We are concerned only with the question of fees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what I want to discuss Sir John. The hon. Lady adopted a technical approach. The concept of accuracy is only one of the eight data protection principles on which the 1984 Act is founded. The Act is concerned with privacy. I remind the hon. Lady that it stemmed from
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
the Council of Europe convention on the protection of indivuduals in respect of the automatic processing of personal data. The Government signed that convention and thus were committed to passing legislation to protect individuals's privacy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Registration allows any member of society to discover whether an automated personal data file exists about him or her and, if so, who controls it. In the United Kingdom, that registration is the only public statement by a data user that describes the type of data that are held, how they are used, to whom the contents of the file is likely to be disclosed, how it was gathered, and whether there has been an overseas transfer of data. Registration is a complex procedure, especially for the small businesses that have already been mentioned. The data user has to compile a public document describing what happens to the personal data.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rationale behind registration is that the processing of personal data by computer can cause invasions of privacy. The public declaration has two purposes—to ensure, that the use of personal data does not get out of hand, and to reassure the public. Charging a fee for such a public document runs counter to those purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An analogy can be drawn with the Register of Members' Interests, in which Members of Parliament make a public declaration of their external interests, such as the directorships that Conservative Members often enjoy. According to the Government's logic, hon. Members should be charged for the entries that they make in that register. Of course, that does not happen because Members of Parliament are considered to be fulfilling a public duty to keep people informed and reassured. However, I believe that the analogy with data registration is exact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have made it clear that the purpose of the fee is to raise revenue for the Data Protection Registrar. No consideration has been given to the principles of the Data Protection Act 1984. The aim is simply to make the DPR self-financing. My hon. Friend the Member for Kingston-upon-Hull, West was right to refer to the element of inflation in the fee. In 1986, it was set at £22. Last year it was raised to £56, and it will be £75 in 1991. That is an increase of 350 per cent. over five years, which is inflation of Latin American proportions. My hon. Friend was also right to draw attention to the fact that the period of time over which the initial set-up costs of the Data Protection Registrar were to be written off was much too short. The Minister did not answer that point very well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should public-spirited data users, who are obliged to make statements, be penalised for helping the public? If I witnessed a crime and reported it at the local police station, I would not be charged for doing my duty. That example is directly analagous to data users who make statements that help the public. It has never been suggested that the Register of Members' Interests should be self-financing. Members do not pay the salaries of the staff who are responsible for the register. Why should data users have to fund the Data Protection Registrar's office? Compliance with the Data Protection Act 1984 is onerous enough without touching data users for £75 for each entry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the order was accepted, registration could resemble buying a television licence. People need a licence to watch television programmes; they should not need a licence to use a computer. If they did that could lead to evasion. Some people are willing to risk getting caught for not paying their television licence fees. Small businesses will take similar
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0099">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
risks with registration fees. Evasion is more likely when the fee is high. The poll tax syndrome will occur, and that could have serious implications for the cost mechanism that the Government are considering. If much evasion takes place, the fee will increase. It is a vicious circle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government and the Opposition have agreed to examine the European draft directive, which makes it clear that all the rules will change in a year's time. Why should small businesses suffer the aggravation of registration when the rules will change? They may well decide to avoid paying the fee and wait until everything has been settled. If small companies do not register, data protection law will fall into disrepute and the privacy of individuals will be jeopardised. What resources has the Minister set aside for policing the measure? Will those costs be included in the fee? If so, the fee will increase even more. If the measure is not policed, small businesses will be tempted not to register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was considering the matter, I remembered that a Data Surveillance Bill was introduced in 1969. It made the registration procedure more difficult, but it did not provide for a registration fee. That Bill is significant because it was introduced by the current Home Secretary. His policy was that there should be no registration fee. Why have the Government moved away from the position taken by the current Home Secretary in 1969?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed registration fee will have an impact on schools, which will find the £75 fee crippling. In 1988, the poll tax officer for a district council based in the Isle of Wight attempted to obtain names and addresses from schools for the poll tax register. That was refused because it was argued that those names and addresses were held not by the local education authority but by the governors of the school, and consequently the data were outside the poll tax officer's powers to obtain. That was substantiated by the Department of Education and Science. I then tabled a series of questions in the House in 1988.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I can see no relevance in what the hon. Gentleman is saying to the order before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is directly relevant. I am sorry if the background is a bit long-winded, I was trying to be short-winded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fee is relevant and it is important to establish whose responsibility it is to register. In 1988, guidance was given that in some cases the person responsible would be the education officer, which meant that the local education authority would have to register. In other cases, it would be the governors or the head teachers. Therefore, every school could have three data users who would all have to pay £75 for the privilege of holding the personal data in the school. It may be all right for a local education authority to pay one £75 fee, but there are 1,200 schools in inner London, all of which would have to pay an extra £150 for the governors and head teachers. That means that an extra £180,000 in registration fees would have to come out of a hard-pressed education budget. Some Conservative members may have 500 schools in a small area in their counties. The order would add an extra £75,000 to their registration fees. The Minister has not taken that into consideration. I appreciate that education is not part of his brief, but registration fees are. The fee imposes a burden on small businesses and small computer users.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
The public statement that data users make through registation is a public duty. They should not have to provide the main source of revenue to fund the Data Protection Registrar's office; public funds should finance it. I object to the way in which the Minister is off-loading the cost. It will be counter productive for data protection. I appreciate that the Minister has been busy with the Criminal Justice Bill and other measures, but will he take a closer look at data protection for the reasons given by myself and my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, West, and abandon the idea of loading the charge on businesses and on schools and small businesses? Will he consider its impact on privacy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.14 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Hain 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Neath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As an innocent newcomer to the Standing Committee arena, I wish to raise some innocent questions. I am probably serving on this Committee, and performing such onerous duties, as training for the Finance Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first point is about the hyper-inflationary increase to which my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) referred. It is intended that the fee will increase from £22 in 1986 to £75 in 1991. Even by this Government's standards, and the difficulties with inflation which has been getting out of control over recent years, a 350 per cent. increase seems extraordinary and is undoubtedly a fund-raising exercise for the Data Protection Registrar. It will increase the chances of evasion and will undermine the purpose of the data protection legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to highlight some aspects that will expecially affect my constituency. West Glamorgan education authority and its schools are under enormous budgetary pressures and are having to make cuts. It is extraordinary that each school will have to come up with £75 for the head teacher, £75 for the board of governors and possibly £75 for the parent teacher association. Given the hard-pressed circumstances of local schools that have to raise funds for text books, and sometimes even for maintenance, it is hard to accept that they should have to come up with this additional money when they should be encouraged to modernise and computerise. Schools will rightly question the Government's priorities in imposing an additional fee on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall cite another example. I was sent a form for my entry in "Who's Who" last week, and it asked me to list the clubs to which I belong. As I do not belong to any of the august London clubs and have no intention of doing so, I put down the Resolven rugby football club, which is in my home village of Resolven in the Neath valley. It is a small club and it will have to pay the £75 just like the Carlton, the Garrick and those other rich London clubs. It is extremely unfair that it should have to pay it when it is facing enormous pressures from the uniform business rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister seriously suggest that ICI and all those large commercial enterprises that declare huge profits every year should be put on the same footing as the Resolven rugby football club, Catwg primary school or Seven Sisters primary school? That is the logic of his position. If he seriously addressed the question of a registration fee, he would surely recommend a banding system—something that is popular with the Government in another sphere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal is unfair both because it will bear down on local ill-funded organisations in a discriminatory way and because it will undermine the whole purpose of the data
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0100">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
protection legislation. It will encourage evasion by small businesses that cannot find the £75 because of crippling interst rates, the uniform business rate and rising inflation. With all those economic problems, the additional bill for £75 may be one that will not be paid, thus undermining the rights of citizens and defeating the purpose of data protection. It is essential that the Minister withdraws the proposal, returns to the original fee, and freezes it for as long as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.20 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Patten</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate. My hon. Friends and I are interested to know the nature of the briefing paper that was clearly in front of the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall). It is not for me to peer at what he is reading; I would not dream of doing so. However, I can only say to the person who issued the briefing paper that members of the Committee regard it as a discourtesy that it was not circulated to all of us—especially if it was provided by a public body, paid for by public funds. I hope that the nameless author of the briefing paper will make clear the source from which it came.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some rather unfair attacks have been made on me for the way in which I drafted the order. The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West is right; I always advocate the use of plain English. Indeed, much to the surprise of everyone, from the draftsmen to the learned judges, the Criminal Justic Bill—one of the numerous Bills that I have taken through the House of Commons this Session—provides for an injunction to be imposed on the High Court and other courts for them to express their decisions in plain English. I try to use plain English. When discussing criminal issues on the "Today" radio programme, I said that people could be "bad". Such plain speaking surprised Mr. Brian Redhead. The provision under the order is technical, and such a technical measure cannot be expressed in any other way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) was interested in why a figure was not mentioned in the order. The fee can be increased by an order, subject to negative resolution under the Data Protection Act 1984, in exercise of the Home Secretary's powers under sections 6(7), 8(5), 40(7) and 41.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paving measures were used when we abolished the Greater London Council. The order that we are discussing is a paving measure. The order to which I referred earlier, which will lay down the figure of £75, must be preceded by the coming into force of this order, which must be made under section 102 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 1987. That is why no figure is mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West referred to users. In essence, we are arguing whether users should pay. I believe that they should. Taxpayers should not be expected to pay for the registration costs, whether large or small, of those who wish to use data. With respect to the hon. Member for Neath (Mr. Hain), whom we welcome to the Committee, it is a rum principle that taxpayers should support the Resolven rugby club. I wish Resolven well, and I hope that it has had a good season. I am sure that it will continue to flourish without taxpayers' funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West asked where the order, and the order for which it paves the way, lie in relation to the forthcoming discussions on the European Community draft directive, to which my hon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
Friend the Member for Torridge and Devon, West (Miss Nicholson) referred. Her Knowledge of data protection issues is known not only nationally and internationally, but probably inter-galactically. She knows more about the subject than almost anyone else I know. It is clear that we cannot and must not change the order and that which will follow it—or, indeed, any data protection legislation—until we have protracted discussions on such a complex matter. I know that the voice of my hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and Devon, West will be heard in such discussions, as will the voice of the hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen), who has a good track record of being interested in the protection of the individual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Neath asked why the fee should be increased so substantially. We have had to ask the registrar to forecast, at three-yearly intervals, what the flow of income and expenditure is likely to be. On each occasion, the forecasts of the amounts that would be coming in have been optimistic, so to ensure that our books should balance it is necessary to have the increase that we are discussing, and which I regard as very modest. To answer the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West, who asked about our inflation assumptions for the coming period, it is a compound inflation rate of about 4 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee agrees that we have had a full debate on an interesting order. I suspect that more interesting debates will occur in later discussions on the EC draft directive. This is a technical subject, but I do not pretend that it does not raise important issues. None the less, I believe that the real debates are still to come and I hope that the Committee will see fit to pass the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.26 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief because we have had a full debate on the order. I am grateful to my hon. Friends the Members for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) and for Neath (Mr. Hain) for their great contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should realise that his comments about a policy of balancing the books are out of fashion in the Conservative party. We regard the order as being anti-small business and anti-personal privacy and civil liberties in many respects. The right hon. Gentleman depressed me with his comments about my briefing paper. He must know that the Home Office shadow team breaks down areas of responsibility, and that this is my area. I have spoken about the matter to four organisations and one consultant, and picked up information from them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not mention the people who do the work, and he is usually very careful in that regard. Those who carry out the registration work should be commended on their performance of a difficult job. The Opposition support them and we want the whole process to be reformed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall not divide the Committee or call our supporters from the Tea Room on the assumption that the Minister will respond to the request made by my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and reconsider the matter. I shall not suggest how the Minister should act, but I hope that he will produce a more rational and sensible policy and that the order will receive proper attention from the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
