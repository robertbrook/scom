	<div class='legislation'>FARM DIVERSIFICATION GRANT (VARIATION) (No. 2) SCHEME 1991</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Farm Diversification Grant (Variation) (No. 2) Scheme 1991.—[	<i>Mr. Neil Hamilton.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the agreement of the Committee, it will be convenient to discuss at the same time the other orders before us, namely, the Farm and Conservation Grant (Variation) Scheme 1991, the draft Farm and Conservation Grant Regulations 1991 and the draft Farm Woodland (Variation) Scheme 1991.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. David Maclean)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The instruments make small technical amendments. They will come into force on 18 July. I shall happily deal with any questions on their operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The overall scope of the current grant schemes will change very little as a result of the amendments. The emphasis will continue to be on targeting aid at antipollution measures, on enhancing the rural environment and on encouraging farmers to seek alternative sources of income through diversification. I am sure that hon. Members will welcome, as I do, the creation of one simplified scheme to cover both farm and conservation grants and diversification grants, which should ease farmers' paperwork and increase awareness of the opportunities for diversification. I commend the instruments to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.31 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elliot Morley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glanford and Scunthorpe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Minister that the schemes are beneficial to farmers. The Opposition have long supported such an approach, which enhances conservation and provides opportunities for members of the farming community to increase their income by undertaking other activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister clarify some points? First, does the Farm Woodland (Variation) Scheme simply vary the areas in which grants are available rather than change the main thrust of the grants? Secondly, I assume that under the Farm Diversification Grant (Variation) (No. 2) Scheme, the closing date for applications is being changed from November 1994 to 17 July 1991 to clear existing applications, because the scheme is being superseded by being merged with the Farm and Conservation Grant (Variation) Scheme. Will the Minister confirm that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under regulation 2(1) of the Farm and Conservation Grant Regulations, use of land for woodlands is eligible for grant where the woodlands are ancillary to the agricultural practices of the farm. Does that mean that the grants are designed only for commercial woodlands? Will landscape
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
improvement or participation in such schemes as community forests, for example, be eligible for a grant under the scheme?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On page 3, the development of beneficial organisms is brought into the list of activities eligible for grant aid. I have no quibble with that. Much work has been done on biological control with such creatures as parasitic wasps and lace wings which can be released into greenhouses to control aphids, for example. However, the Minister will remember that there was much discussion about such control, and new regulations were implemented under the Environmental Protection Act 1990, which also covers the development of genetically modified organisms. It is inevitable that much more work on biological control will be carried out, involving the genetic modification of various insects, to target them specifically at some pest species. I know that such development is covered by the provisions of the Act, but when people apply to carry out the development of such biological control of pests, will their work be properly monitored, to ensure that there is no risk of such insects or of modified insects being released into the environment, as that could cause an imbalance in the natural ecology?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sub-paragraph (c) on page 5 will exclude the manufacture of wine from eligibility for grant aid. Will the Minister explain why? Will there be separate grants for the manufacture of wine, or does he have something against the British wine industry?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome sub-paragraph (d) on page 12, on maintaining the countryside. The Opposition have argued strongly for that. It is better to focus support for agriculture on environmental objectives than to provide open-ended subsidies for production. Has the Minister discussed with his colleagues at the Department of the Environment how the proposed planning legislation on the protection of hedgerows would affect that sub-paragraph? He may remember that the Government overturned a clause that had been inserted into the Planning and Compensation Bill, which would have given local authorities the power to enter maintenance agreements with farmers on the protection of hedgerows. That clause was removed by the Government on the grounds that consultation on it had not been completed that they were not sure how it would be applied. Will the Minister comment on the fact that under the Bill funds are available which would fit in with legal planning control to protect ancient hedgerows?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation (3) on page 16 will prevent the Minister from awarding grants for pig production unless that expenditure would not entail an increase in production. I understand the logic of that; the pig industry has not received state support and has never complained about the fact. It operates efficiently and successfully, but, as the Minister is aware, impending legislation will change methods of pig production, particularly in relation to the stalls in which pigs are reared. Will a change from the traditional pig units—they will be outlawed in, I think, five years—to stalls that allow more room be eligible for grant aid? In addition, there has been a trend in the pig industry away from the intensive inside pig unit towards the field production system. Will such a change of system be eligible for grant aid?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0430">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Regulation 9(a) on page 28 defines a young farmer as someone under 40. Is that a legal definition, or one that has been introduced by the Minister? Is 40 the cut-off age for Young Conservatives? In the Politburo, anyone under 40 is considered a very young politician.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the proposal in regulation 15(1)(d) on page 33, that a grant will be refused if the development plan would damage the countryside. That is a very sensible proposal and I congratulate the Minister on including it. However, there is a potential contradiction between the worthy aims of that regulation and some work that will be eligible for grant aid under the legislation. The sort of work that would be eligible is listed in schedule 1. Hedgerows and stiles are included. The Government also propose to make payments for increased access. Will they provide grant aid for building stiles?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 1, paragraph 3 provides that the burning of heather will be grant-aided in some circumstances. The Minister will be aware that, in Scotland, heather is burned to control the numbers of red grouse. Recreational and sporting activities can be eligible for grant aid under the regulations. It could be argued that managing a grouse moor is a sporting activity. However, in Scotland, some estate owners have built roads from the valleys right up to the moors in a way that is unsympathetic and damaging to the environment. Rather than following the contours of the hills, they have driven bulldozers straight up to the top of the moors, so people who pay a lot of money to shoot grouse do not have to walk up to the top and can be driven up in Range Rovers in luxury and comfort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unreasonable for public money to be used for the construction of such road access, which spoils many parts of the highlands, simply so that yuppie grouse shooters will not have to get their feet dirty by walking up the moors. I hope that the Minister will give an assurance that such developments will not be eligible for grant aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the fact that, under paragraph 6, wind, water and renewable energy systems will be eligible for grant aid. However, the aid is comparatively modest. Such systems deserve encouragement. They are beneficial to small, isolated, rural farms, and many British firms are putting a great deal of money into developing and marketing such systems. It would be a great boost to them if the installation of such facilities were encouraged, especially in isolated areas. Apart from the advantages to the farms concerned, such aid would provide a wider marketable base and would boost the economic development of these companies' products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The possible contradiction that I mentioned earlier is dealt with in paragraph 8. The replacement of farm drains will be eligible for grant aid. I welcome the fact that the replacement of drainage on heathland and moorland will be excluded. The Minister will be aware that one of the fastest declining habitats in Britain is the traditional wet meadow. I doubt whether the destruction of wet meadows, such as those that were drained in years gone by when there were grants for drinage and hedgerow removal, should be encouraged. Is the Minister taking advice from the statutory nature conservation bodies about the impact of the grants on wet meadows and low-lying flood plains? I appreciate that some of them are covered by sites of special scientific interest notification, which gives them some protection, but some are not. I should be grateful for his comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Schedule 2 deals with farm-based industry. Grants are available for buildings. I mentioned the pig industry and asked whether field systems would be eligible for grant. Would farmers who want to switch systems—for example, fron an intensive egg production cage unit to a free-range system or a perchery or barn egg system—be eligible for a grant, not necessarily because they are increasing production, but because they are taking account of animal welfare consideration?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the new type of farrowing cages being introduced be covered by capital expenditure grant aid?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the special recognition for the Scilly Isles, which I know quite well. They are a special and beautiful part of our natural heritage. The grants for shelter belts would be most appreciated by farmers, because bulb growing is a major industry there. Because of the special nature of the Scilly Isles, will grant applications for shelter belts or other changes be referred to the relevant bodies to assess their impact on the natural heritage and the environmental importance of the Scilly Isles?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.44 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Carlisle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my colleagues will indulge me for a few moments and that the Minister will accept my remarks on paragraph 3(3) of the accompanying document, which refers to qualifying businesses in respect of horses and ponies. I see that the Whip is staring hard at me, probably encouraging me to declare an interest. My wife runs a small riding school on the family farm where we live. I should like to take the opportunity of explaining to the Minister on behalf of the riding school industry how the regulations will affect it. I should like to underline the difficulties that many riding schools—especially the smaller ones—will face as grants become available to farmers to diversify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am part of a family of cereal farmers and I therefore understand the pressures on agriculture. I appreciate the need for diversification. However, some of the grants now being made available will hurt small businesses, especially in the horse and pony world. They will be in jeopardy and could be forced to close.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another of my interests, as the Committee will know, is sport and recreation. We should recognise the importance—to young and, indeed, to older people—of the sport of horse riding. The Minister should know that many are worried about its future because of the grants to farmers to diversify. The riding school industry is already under great pressure because of the uniform business rate. Some schools have to pay a higher rate than they used to. Regrettably, it is becoming a question of competition between riding schools and farms—a competition in which riding schools are at a distinct disadvantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister should also know that riding schools have been regulated under the Licensing Act 1964. Those seeking to establish a business to teach adults or children to ride, or just to let out horses for hire and return, come under those necessary regulations—none within the industry would complain about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, when grants are made available to farmers, many of them may take the opportunity of converting redundant buildings into stables and letting them out to local children and adults for the hire and keeping of horses—without coming under the regulations by which proper riding schools have to abide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0431">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
Riding schools can involve great expense. Not only do horses have to be approved by a veterinary surgeon every year, but owners have to pay premiums for insurance. Moreover, the premises are, under the terms of the Licensing Act, under the direct control of the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to establish, once these new grants are given to farmers to diversify into this activity, whether those farmers will themselves fall under the terms of the Act. Will the Minister explain—if not now, in a written reply—whether he is aware that a large number of farmers are now letting buildings and fields for children keeping ponies? Sometimes conditions can be appalling; and it appears that some areas effectively fall outside the law. Is the Minister satisfied that local authorities are doing what they should to ensure that such premises are inspected and kept in a reasonable condition?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members will surely agree that the welfare of animals is important and that horses should be properly looked after. We all know of cases where horses and ponies are kept in atrocious conditions, and owners sometimes get away with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend should also be aware that there is some distress about the unfair advantage that farmers receiving grants will gain in terms of VAT payment. Most agricultural products and services are VAT-free; not so for riding schools. If a farmer buys feed or fertiliser, or if he uses a contractor, he gets the VAT back. Yet, as I said, that does not apply to horses, ponies and riding schools. So where farmers set up in competition with local riding schools they have an immediate advantage—in terms of Customs and Excise—over other proprietors. The Minister must take note of that anxiety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general, we welcome taxpayers' money being given to farmers to enable them to diversify their activities. However, there should be some in-depth investigation by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, to ensure that people in the horse and pony world are not disadvantaged by the grants. As the grants come into operation over the next few years, as riding schools perhaps begin to spring up on farms and as farmers begin to keep more horses and ponies for hire, we must ensure that riding schools are not put at a disadvantage. I do not seek to withdraw my support, in principle, for the grants. I would understand if the Minister was unable to give me a full reply today, but he must examine the problem closely. I hope that he will allay some of the worst fears that the people in the horse and pony industry are expressing to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.50 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I shall comment on what my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North (Mr. Carlisle) said. I assure him that my Department will look very carefully at who would be eligible for our grant scheme. We decided that grants for horses and ponies would be available only in less favoured areas, so as not to cause unfair or distorted competition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend made some telling points about animal welfare; he was concerned that some people may be keeping horses or ponies in unsatisfactory conditions. The Government would deplore that. Anyone who seeks a grant from my Department will have to satisfy all the legal requirements on welfare codes. Coming into London on the train from Heathrow, one sees many grubby little
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
paddocks for ponies. Unfortunately, most are not under the direct control of my Department, because they are not on farms, and we cannot do anything about them. Some people own a couple of acres of land, stick a horse on it and think that there is enough grass to feed that horse throughout the winter; that possibly constitutes a problem of animal welfare which is outside the scope of my Department, but of which the public should be aware.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
VAT is a matter for my colleagues in the Treasury. If there are any technical points that my hon. Friend has raised and which I have not addressed, I shall write to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall take in reverse order the points raised by the hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley). The Scilly Isles have the same consultation procedures as the rest of the British Isles and they would continue to be consulted on any changes that we might make to grants in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We discussed with conservation bodies the possible impact of the drainage grant on wet meadows when the farm conservation grant scheme was introduced in 1989. We do not propose to make any changes to it. The hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe underestimated the importance of SSSIs and the impossibility of getting such a designation changed or lifted in England, although such amendment is possible in Scotland. The designation SSSI is an effective method of protecting the thousands of SSSIs in this country. We also have specially designated environmentally sensitive areas. Yesterday, I drove through the Somerset Levels ESA, where we have successfully introduced a scheme to maintain the wetlands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I concede the value of the schemes that the Minister has mentioned. However, there has been much disquiet about the Somerset Levels—to take the case in point—because it is believed that the water levels are not being adequately controlled to encourage wildlife, even though large sums are being devoted to that. A designation as an SSSI does not stop many of the sites being destroyed or seriously damaged, as the Minister knows.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Questions about the interpretation of an SSSI designation and about the effectiveness of ESAs and how they might be changed have nothing to do with the grant scheme. There are ways of protecting wet meadows which experts, in their wisdom, believe, are worth protecting. There are SSSIs and ESAs, which should not affect the grants required by other farmers for drainage development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the point raised by the hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe, grants for roads will be available only under the legislation relating to diversification and grants will not be payable to any farmer who builds a road that causes environmental damage. The Government are unable to prescribe who will drive over the road, and whether they will be yuppies or Labour party supporters. These days, they are likely to be one and the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding the hon. Gentlemen's point about young fanners, it would be unkind of me to suggest that the Labour party is likely to know more than I do about the workings of the Politburo, but the cut-off age of 40 has been introduced by our European masters, not by me. It is not the age of eligibility for the Young Conservatives—I wish that it were, because some of us might then still qualify.

The grants available to pig farmers are for environmental improvements, slurry containment and the like. We shall not provide grants for animal welfare

improvements. Where the law on animal welfare has been changed, we regard it as a farmer's automatic duty to comply with the highest standards and we do not consider it right to introduce additional grants to encourage farmers to comply with the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Carlisle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend said that grants could be made available for the disposal of slurry. Is he aware of the many difficulties that will be faced by the pig industry when new regulations emanating from Europe are introduced to restrict the amount of slurry that may be spread on fields? These regulations will be most disadvantageous to small farmers, particularly "concrete" pig farmers, who find it difficult to dispose of their slurry now, but will find it even more difficult when the amount of slurry per hectare is restricted. They will have to go further afield to dispose of it and that will cost them more. Does the Minister envisage that grants will be available to assist farmers in those circumstances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is impossible for me to hypothesise at this stage. We are constantly reviewing the grants and there will always be farmers who see ways of extending the grants to help them; but only a limited amount of money is available. The grants available for farmers to deal with slurry are a generous 50 per cent. Many dairy farmers would like us to give them money for what they term the separation of waste and rainwater—that really means building a roof over the silage pit—but we have decided not to pay for that. If we decided that we would, the money would come out of the same pool and there would be less for other farmers to build slurry pits or to take containment measures. We must be careful when we give extra grants that we do not disadvantage other farmers who are in equal need.

The hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe asked me abouts hens and grants for welfare-friendly systems for free range. Unfortunately, under European Community rules, poultry is excluded from grant schemes and is ineligible under any of these systems.

The hon. Gentleman also asked me about hedgerows. The grants in the legislation are for hedgerows on farms: for farmers to plant and lay hedges. I am pleased to say that, throughout the country, farmers are planting many more hedges and—I see this in the Lake District—they are laying more hedges. The skill of hedge-laying is reviving. A tremendous amount of work is going on and the grants are very successful. However, that has nothing to do with the plans of my colleagues in the Department of the Environment to make hedgerow protection orders. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said that they had not finished their consultation, and I believe that they are absolutely right not to rush into a scheme that has not been properly thought out and which does not have proper monitoring arrangements. I look forward to there being a properly worked, costed, funded and monitored hedgerow protection scheme, available throughout the country, to create hedgerows on farms where they do not exist.

Wine production was never eligible for farm diversification grants and the orders will not extend the scheme to make it eligible. Yesterday, I had the privilege of sampling some superb English wine at Pilton Manor in Somerset. I have obtained three bottles of that excellent liquor and, if my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
had not made such a long speech this morning, I would have concluded before 11 o'clock, and would have been able to open one.

The Government keep these matters under review, but I urge a note of caution. The wine business is highly specialised and I would not encourage farmers to diversify into wine growing. It would be easy for them to get their fingers burnt and wine production is not suitable for on-farm diversification.

As for beneficial organisms, a host of regulatory rules apply to the creation of genetically manulpulated organisms. The Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment decides whether organisms can safely be released. Government controls already cover that and the legislation will merely allow a farmer to obtain a grant for a glasshouse in which to grow or keep the beneficial organisms once he has been through the bureaucratic clearance procedures. The farmer does not have to make any decisions about releasing organisms into the environment, or to check whether they are safe because he must have clearance before he can obtain a glasshouse grant.

I concur entirely with the first two points of the hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe. The Farm Woodland (Variation) Scheme simply extends its proposals, to the new less favoured areas and the closing date for applications under the Farm Diversification Grant (Variation) (No. 2) scheme has been brought forward from 1994 to 1991. That is merely a technical measure. We have had to close the scheme earlier to amalgamate it with the new one and then we shall re-open the whole shooting match. If I have missed any other technical points I shall gladly write to the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
