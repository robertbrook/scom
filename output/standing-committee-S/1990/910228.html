	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secrertary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr Jeremy Hanley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Food Safety (Northern Ireland) Order 1991.</p></q>
I hope that the Committee will bear with me while, for just a few minutes, I describe the most important provisions that will eventually be introduced into Northern Ireland legislation through this order. As regards timing, we very much hope that, should the order pass the Committee today, it will be presented to the Privy Council on 20 March and become law on 20 May. The Government are very keen to introduce this legislation as soon as possible for the benefit of consumers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's underlying concern in producing the order has been, and will continue to be, to ensure that consumer safety comes first, wherever practicable. Our aim must be to ensure that the highest possible standards are maintained at each and every stage of the food manufacturing, preparation and distribution process. But we must be realistic. There must be a proper balance between legal controls and the need to allow—indeed, encourage—the food industry to innovate and compete successfully in the single market post-1992. Furthermore, the consumers of Northern Ireland would not tolerate an impossible pursuit of perfection that would mean that only the wealthy few could afford the wide choice and quality of food that we all want to see in the shops. The order, which reflects the provisions of the Food Safety Act in Great Britain, aims to achieve just that balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It follows that if we are to maintain this-balanced approach it is necessary to have regard to the changing nature of the food industry. In updating and improving the food safety law, we must make provision not just for 1991 but for the foreseeable future. This law must stand for a considerable time, particularly to alleviate uncertainty. Accordingly, the structure of the order provides a tough but flexible framework that does two things. First, it extends and strengthens the existing law where appropriate; secondly, it provides the enabling power for a wide range of regulations that can be used to make sure that the law keeps pace with the rapid technological advances in the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the main provisions of the order. First, it will re-create existing offences, but will be much wider in scope than the present law. In passing, speaking not only as a health Minister but as an argiculture Minister, I believe that farmers now recognise that their responsibility does not end at the farm gate. The industry has been badly hit by consumer scares in recent years. Therefore, farmers are now becoming far more realistic in the way that they produce food for final consumption. To this end the order
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
will introduce a new concept of "commercial operations", which will include every conceivable thing that can be done to food in the course of producing, storing, delivering, selling, importing and exporting it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, the definition of food itself will be wider and will now include dietary supplements and water used in food production or taken with food, and bottled waters. The definition of food premises will encompass vehicles and stalls, and there is provision for including ships and aircraft. The order will also apply to any food given away at a public entertainment or as an advertisement, and will cover materials in contact with food.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order will create a new offence of selling food that does not comply with food safety requirements. This is food which has been rendered injurious to health, which is unfit for human consumption or which is so contaminated that it would not be reasonable to expect it to be used for human consumption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If an enforcement authority discovers that part of a batch of food does not comply with food safety requirements, the whole of the batch can be presumed not to comply, unless the owner of the food proves otherwise. The enforcement authority will have power to inspect, detain or seize food suspected of not complying with food safety requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order also contains a substantial range of new enforcement powers. For example, a system of legally enforceable improvement notices will be introduced. If a food business fails to comply with food hygiene or food processing regulations, an enforcement officer can serve a notice on the proprietor requiring him to take measures to remedy the defects within a given period. Failure to comply with an improvement notice will be an offence. We take this matter very seriously. The maximum fine on summary conviction will be £20,000, and there will be an unlimited fine or a prison sentence for offences on indictment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Additionally, following conviction for an offence under the food safety law, a court will have powers to make a prohibition order. The effect of such an order will be to close down unsanitary food premises, to prohibit premises from being used for particular kinds of food businesses and to prevent the use of a piece of equipment or a particular process. It can even prohibit a person from carrying on or managing any food business, on public health grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where the carrying on of a business poses an imminent risk to health an enforcement officer can impose an emergency prohibition notice, stopping the operation of the business in its entirety. Where this type of notice is imposed the enforcement officer must apply to a court within three days for the issue of an emergency prohibition order. If he does not do so, it will lapse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be new powers to enable Departments to issue emergency control orders requiring any food that poses an immediate risk to health to be withdrawn from the market. These are not intended to replace the present voluntary system, whereby arrangements are made with manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers to have a hazardous food withdrawn from sale. In general the voluntary system has worked well, and I would expect most incidents still to be dealt with under these arrangements. However, the power to make emergency control orders needs to be available in the event of a breakdown in those voluntary arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0213">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
The order also introduces wide-ranging and flexible regulation-making powers. These powers are necessary to provide the detailed controls needed on the composition, labelling and hygiene of food, residues in food, materials and articles in contact with food and to permit and control novel foods and processes. The regulations will also require that food handlers should undergo hygiene training. Powers will also be given to require registration or licensing of food businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned registration and licensing. We expect that registration will apply generally and will ensure that district councils in Northern Ireland are aware of the existence and nature of any food businesses in their area. However, where there is only occasional use of premises such as church halls as food premises—there has been some concern about this—which we would measure as no more than one day a week, those premises will not require to be registered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Licensing will be limited to certain high-risk operations and businesses where novel foods are produced or novel processes such as irradiation carried out, and to milk producers and dairies. A novel food is one that is not sold at present in Northern Ireland or a process that is not currently a normal food process in general use. The regulation-making powers are supplemented by provisions to enable any European Community obligations to be implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certain of the regulation-making powers will, when appropriate, apply to food sources, such as live animals. That will permit the effective enforcement of provisions on antibiotic residues in animals or pesticide residues in foodstuffs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions that I have outlined are the main provisions on enforcement and consumer protection, but the order also provides for an enforcement authority to bypass the immediate offender and take action against the "real" offender. For example, defective food might be purchased in a supermarket, and the retailer would therefore be the apparent offender and first point of inquiry. However, it may become clear to the enforcement authority that it is not the retailer but the manufacturer who was the real offender. In such circumstances, action can be taken direct against the manufacturer, or perhaps importer, if the manufacturer is abroad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This bypass provision will complement a new defence— that of due diligence—to be introduced by the order. It provides a statutory defence for persons charged with an offence who can show that they
	<br><q><p>"took all reasonable precautions and exercised all due diligence to avoid committing the offence".</p></q>
The order sets out the circumstances in which a person may be deemed to satisfy that defence. They include, for example, a retailer who buys goods under the brand name of a supplier. A person can also be deemed to comply with the defence if he can prove that the offence was the fault of someone else and that he could not reasonably know that an offence was committed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The remaining provisions—I am sure there is no need to go into them in detail today—deal with the analysis of food, the provisions of the necessary powers of entry and arrangements for prosecutions. It will also be an offence to obstruct an enforcement officer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Enforcement of the order generally will be by authorised officers of district councils. Indeed, I am to address a meeting of them in the very near future. We are very grateful to the enforcement officers. They will have an
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
extremely important role to play in protecting the consumer throughout Northern Ireland. Therefore, their training and appreciation of the problems are of the highest importance. To ensure uniform enforcement, the order enables the Department of Health and Social Services to issue codes of practice on the implementation and enforcement of the legislation, and to issue directions on specific steps to be taken to give effect to codes of practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government recognise that the order will impose additional duties on district councils. They will certainly need more staff if they are to discharge their responsibilities effectively. Accordingly, we have agreed to make available to district councils an additional allocation of some £850,000 in 1991–92 and subsequent years. Why that amount? It is equivalent on a pro rata population basis to the additional funds allocated for this purpose to local authorities in Great Britain. The multiple of 2.78 per cent, is the one normally used for this purpose. The figure that it was based on was £30 million, which, while not a totally exhaustive calculation of the likely costs, was a best effort at estimating those costs. If there are any surplus costs, they will naturally be considered. Furthermore, regulations will provide that district councils can charge for the training of food handlers and for certain enforcement functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am convinced that the order will make a great contribution to the protection of the consumer by ensuring that food is safe to eat. There is logic in having health and agricultural responsibilities together in Northern Ireland. As I say, too rarely have the consumer and the consumer's health been considered in the past when it came to food manufacture. Now the power of the consumer is understood, and the agriculture industry is becoming far more realistic in its desire for perfection in quality and cleanliness. The consumer, in this regard, has won the battle, and he deserves to. I hope, therefore, that the consumer will feel that the order provides a better framework for consumer protection. I therfore commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.44 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kevin McNamara 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kingston upon Hull, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are in broad agreement with the Government's objectives in the order. It is an important follow-up to the legislation passed for this island. This order is important because of the public's rightful concerns following the various food scares, particularly in the summers, of the past two or three years. From that point of view the order is to be welcomed, and we welcome it. There are, however, a number of points of detail to which I hope the Minister can reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The definition article, on page 6, contains a definition of what food includes, but then we are told that it does not include:
	<br><q><p>"(i) live animals or birds, or live fish which are not used for human consumption while they are alive".</p></q>
Can the Minister tell us those places in Northern Ireland where live animals or birds or live fish are used for human consumption when they are alive? It would be of interest to us all to know. Wide regulatory powers are needed, and clearly flexibility and wide codes of practice are needed. Will the Minister assure us that, in the publication of both the regulations and codes of practice, there will be wide consultations with producers and consumer bodies to ensure that something is not foisted upon food producers, or indeed the consumer, without people having a proper opportunity to discuss the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0214">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
That leads me to a point on which I should like some elucidation from the Minister. I have in mind the conveying by post of vacuum-packed smoked fish. We discussed this matter briefly on another occasion, but basically it relates to regulations being introduced into the United Kingdom which seek to prohibit the sending by post of smoked fish. Colleagues will recall the articles on that matter in 	<i>The Independent</i> of 2 February, followed by a sterling call to arms by Bernard Levin in 	<i>The Times</i> on 14 February. Members of the Committee might recall his splendid words on this matter. He began by saying:
	<br><q><p>"it is notoriously difficult to mark precisely the moment at which a country's freedom has been so eroded by Ministers and their officials that serious thought must be given to pelting these pestilent busy bodies with offal in the streets or putting rat-poison in their coffee. But I think it is now time for the rat-poison."</p></q>
In Northern Ireland that would be a scheduled offence. I do not know whether writing in The Times accords some immunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bernard Levin went on to say something which I believe is important. He said:
	<br><q><p>"In a number of items, not many but a satisfactory list, British food, which was once the despair of the world, can now challenge that of almost any other country. Among the most notable of these triumphs is the quality and variety of smoked fish we produce. Nowhere, certainly not in France (which deservedly carries off more culinary prizes than any other nation)"—</p></q>
that is not something that I accept; Northern Ireland food is beyond comparison—
	<br><q><p>"is there smoked salmon to touch ours for succulence and flavour; the same goes for smoked trout and other aquatic beasties, including eels."</p></q>
This is a serious matter for Northern Ireland for firms producing smoked eels, and, in particular, smoked salmon, because Northern Ireland is one of the few sources of wild, unfarmed salmon. Therefore it is an important, although small, export industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And the smoked eel fisheries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNamara</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They have gone as well?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNamara</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman had me worried for a moment. I like my smoked eel. I am sorry, Mr Leadbitter. I beg your pardon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a matter of some importance, and it would be very bad if the English disease were to spread to Northern Ireland. I believe, that the Scots have put up some sort of fight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Both the Chair and the 	<i>Hansard</i> reporter were having difficulty in hearing what was being said. That little tête-á-tê te may have been interesting to the two hon. Members, but the humour escaped us. If an hon. Member makes an intervention, will he make it clearly, so that we can get it on the record?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNamara</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is part of the new policy of the Ulster Unionists and the British Labour party—a closeness and an identity of our political ideas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman was pointing out that although, sadly, he had lost a smoked salmon firm in his constituency, the two smoked eels firms were thriving, and we welcome that. As I was saying, the English have caused some problems. The Scots seem not to be taking a similar course of action, and I hope that, unless there is positive proof of injury to public health from smoked fish being sent through the post, the Government will take no steps in Northern Ireland to deal with the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have two final points. Can the Minister give us precise details about the use of public buildings—community halls and so on—once a week? Will that be once a week on average, or once a week per week? Many community halls, particularly at Easter during the summer, and at Christmas, are used by more than one organisation for a sale of work, to sell, food and things, to raise funds and it could impose great financial burdens upon a local community centre if it had to meet some of the regulations when it is only a seasonal occurrence for a brief period in the year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point relates to the penalties and selling material unfit for human consumption. It would be helpful if the Minister could use this opportunity to say exactly what a sell-by date means on food. Is it merely a recommended date by which food should be sold, and, that food sold after that date is still wholesome? Or does it mean that food should not be sold after that date and should be withdrawn? It is a matter that can cause confusion, not so much perhaps for tinned and canned foods, but for packed meats, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the order. It is important for all concerned. It seeks to strike a balance between the interests of producers and consumers. There is shortly to be the Northern Ireland foods exhibition, and I trust that it will be a great success.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.53 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We in Northern Ireland welcome the fact that the law in Northern Ireland is catching up with that in Great Britain. I believe that the Great Britain legislation became effective in January this year. Northern Ireland is only now getting this order, and thereafter, if my understanding is correct, the regulations will have to go out for consultation. Therefore, we shall be 18 months or more behind the rest of the United Kingdom in the application of modern food law.

That is not an acceptable way of proceeding in food matters, especially when so much of the food production in Northern Ireland is exported to Great Britain. Here is a classic case for having a single United Kingdom Bill. If there had been one, all die comments to the Minister by his officials in Northern Ireland and those to us since, would have been considered during the passage of the Great Britain legislation. That this is a matter that should be borne in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is well aware that the Unionist Party's view is that legislation for the United Kingdom should be in a single Bill, and we must look again at those areas where the disparity in legislation is a potential source of friction between one part of the kingdom and another because of the different standards demanded by law. We produce

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
wholesome food in Northern Ireland, we export it and we are anxious to see that export market continuing without any interruption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Government to take the point on board and consider it in the general context. There are matters on which 40 or 50 years ago, one could perhaps have got away with separate legislation, but I believe that nowadays, with modern means of transport, that is no longer acceptable and that legislation should be uniform throughout the kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNamara</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The old structure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The old Stormont system was capable of doing it rather more quickly than we seem to in this House, and of keeping us more in line, because we knew what was happening. The problems that arise with this long tailback did not necessarily arise under the Stormont system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister use the opportunity presented by the regulations to close any loopholes that may have been shown up by the use of the present legislation in Great Britain, or will he be completely bound by the existing regulations? That needs to be cleared up, because it might be important in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the fanner's responsibility did not end at the farm gate. Up to a point that is true, but it cannot be wholly true. The fanner's control ends at the farm gate, and he cannot therefore be held responsible for what happens to the product after that point. He can only produce wholesome food and sell it at the farm gate. I hope that the Minister will reconsider what he said as a general principle, because it could not stand up in law, never mind in fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two differences will remain, whenever the legislation is passed, between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. One is that the control of milk will remain under the Agriculture Department in Northern Ireland, and the regulation of meat inspections will also remain under the control of that department. No doubt the Minister will be happy to explain the reasons for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister expand a little more on the question of food given away as prizes? Does that extend to the Christmas turkey put up as a prize, or to the cake baked by the ladies of the women's institute or mothers' union for a prize? Some of the ladies would be very cross if they thought that their baking was not up to the standard demanded by the local public health inspector. If the public health inspector is prepared to face the fury of the cooks and bakers of Northern Ireland, they are braver men than I take them to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Minister for stating the amount of money to be given to councils in Northern Ireland to fund the new regulations, but I hope he will remember that Northern Ireland has a land frontier and that food moves cheerfully, both legally and illegally, across that frontier—all sorts of food, some of it perhaps that would never come on the market. We have a long history of problems with unfit meat, some of which comes across the border, but some undoubtedly produced in Northern Ireland. That may well be an added burden to councils in Northern Ireland, and I hope the Minister will keep that firmly in mind when he fixes the sums that those councils might need to fund the policing of the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noted with interest that, in the early stages of the order, water is treated as food, but in article 50 there is a let-out for the DOE water service. The legislative programme for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
the Water Act 1989 does not apply to Northern Ireland. If an owner or proprietor of premises selling food gets water from the DOE and sells it and it is unfit, it seems that he is responsible. The DOE, however, which supplied the water to him, manages to escape. That cannot be right, and I hope that the Minister will give it some consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a good reason for suspending the application of that article until such time as the legislative equivalent of the Water Act applies in Northern Ireland. The DOE normally supplies good water. Northern Ireland has an excellent water supply, but there are times when it goes wrong, and I should not like the proprietor of premises caught by the application of that article. I hope that the Minister will take that on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Articles 4 and 5 refer to animals that have to be slaughtered other than other than in a slaughterhouse. This refers to occasions when a farm animal, beef, mutton or lamb, meets with an accident and has to be slaughtered quickly on the farm, or in some cases in the knacker's yard. Public health officials have expressed considerable concern to me about this matter. They believe that such animals should always be declared unfit for human consumption as a matter of course. That may be a matter for argument, but I hope that the Minister will consider the question of the compensation in those circumstances, and perhaps inform farmers that they might do better to rely on insurance for the loss of that animal than on the sale of its flesh. This is a serious point, even if it arises only occasionally. The value of an animal can be considerable, and there is always a willingness by unscrupulous people to use any loophole that exists. In the light of that, will the Minister be careful when writing the regulations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an extension of the power regarding food that is likely to cause food poisoning. This is apparently a re-enactment of the provisions of article 11 of the Food (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, but no guidance is given on the interpretation of the term "likely". Surely a clearer form of words could have been achieved. Some of my public health officials are not happy with the present wording and would like it to be more specific and accurate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the question of the 21 days in which to have the food analysed. I understand that on some occasions it might take longer, especially with residues of pesticides, and things like angel dust, which is occasionally used by some unscrupulous people in Northern Ireland. I hope the Minister will keep that firmly in mind in considering the regulations. Angel dust is an abomination. The Minister will recall answering questions by me on that recently. I hope that it will be firmly dealt with, because if it becomes widespread it will do untold damage. There will always be unscrupulous people who will use it. It is difficult to spot, and I hope that every effort will be made to come up with a speedy and effective means of identifying the use of such substances in cattle, sheep and pigs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My attention has been drawn also to article 13, which deals with
	<br><q><p>"food not of the nature of substance or quality".</p></q>
It is said that whenever one uses that phrase in court, the court has to decide which of the three terms is intended. It has been suggested to me that if it were to read
	<br><q><p>"nature, substance or quality",</p></q>
the courts might take whichever of the three they found fitting to the occasion, rather than let the offender escape on a technicality because the wrong word was used. There have been occasions when people have got away on that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0216">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
technicality. The public health officers are concerned that it can be used in the future, and they would prefer the all-embracing wording that I have suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 14 re-enacts with important amendments, article 8 of the Food (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, and as such it is welcome, but it would appear that article 14(l)(a), which should read,
	<br><q><p>"falsely describes any food; or"</p></q>
is missing. Has there been an error or omission in printing the article? These are all matters that have been raised by public health authorties, who have naturally been through the order with a fine-toothed comb to try to find out exactly what the situation is. We are greatly obliged to them, because only the experts can do that in the necessary detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 17, which gives the district council a role in novel foods, is very much to be welcomed, but the explanatory document refers to the Department of Agriculture alone as being responsible for special designations for milk. That takes me back to the point that I made at the outset of my remarks. It seems that in Great Britain the district councils enforce the regulations. That may be incorrect, but, if so, I should be grateful to be told.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be pleased to know why a difference is being made. I know that traditionally the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland has handled milk, because of its involvement with creameries, and so forth, and because it is the six county-wide authority, but perhaps the Minister can explain why it is considered that in Great Britain councils should do the work, whereas in Northern Ireland the Department is needed. That would clear up the matter in people's minds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the question of the registration and licensing of food permises. It is clear from the order that the Government are drawing a distinction between the registration and the licensing of premises. Some public health officers have told me that they would have preferred a comprehensive licensing system for all premises dealing in foods. The Government have clearly rejected that approach. I should be grateful if the Minister could tell me why, because, if there is a difference, the public have a right to know. The Government seem to believe that certain types of premises for food that is handled need a licence, while others can get away with less control. We need not to be told why that is so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 19 says that if an offence is due to the fault of another person, that is now a defence. That is perfectly all right, but it raises a difficulty in my mind which will increase in coming years, as our food production declines in line with the views of the Americans and the importation of food from elsewhere rises. I have always viewed some of the objections raised at the GATT talks with grave suspicion, because I never thought that food-exporting countries such as New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the United States were Third world countries which would benefit from the export of food to this country. They seem to me to be nations which are very much in the forefront of the First world, and which have good quality food which they are anxious to sell.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not forget that certain substances that can be used in the production of meat in the United States are banned in the EEC, and I wonder how we can identify those substances in imported food. If they are there, who will be responsible for them? I mention that in passing. Will it be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
the importer? If it is not the importer, it must be the exporter. How can we get at him? If it is not the importer or the exporter, will it be the retailer in Northern Ireland, with all the horrendous financial problems that that might cause?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That goes wider than the order, but it is related to it, and I hope that it is something that the Government keep in mind when they look to the Third world, or the First world, to export food to us in large quantities. We have no control over how that food is produced in any of those nations, but we are expected to sell it here and eat it, and we shall expect those who handle it in this country to be responsible for it. Therefore, it is not a light matter, but a major one that has implications for everyone who eats food in this country, and I think that that is most of us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 20 establishes for the first time the single-limbed defence of all reasonable precautions and all due diligence. Will that be the sort of defence that people can use in future? If so, who pays? Who will be responsible when something goes wrong, as it inevitably will?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order also refers to food hygiene training. I believe the Minister will confirm that most environmental health departments already provide food hygiene training and have been issuing certificates locally. That has been warmly received by the general public where it has been done, and it will lead to an improvement in standards. The councils are to be complimented on their initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 23 relates to the provision of facilities for cleaning shellfish—another aspect of the fishing industry that was not mentioned by the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Mr McNamara). We produce some shellfish in Northern Ireland. I believe that all such fish have to go through a system called flushing so that any residues can be removed from them, which means keeping them in tanks of clean water for a time. I understand that the terms used are imprecise and are not defined in the order. If the Minister will be so kind as to ensure that they are covered in the regulations, many people will be very happy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that this is a useful order, but there are a number of matters that must be covered in the regulations and I hope that the Minister has taken them on board, not least the questions of enforcement and powers of entry. It seems to me and to the folk who advise me that there are occasions when public health officials need not only extensive powers of entry, but powers to ensure that, once they have entered premises, they can seize and hold for examination the articles and food material found there and can take photographs and so forth. That, I am told, is not covered in the order. Will it be covered in the regulations, because those involved with food are worried about it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is all that I have to say about the order, other than to repeat that it is useful updating, and to express the hope that it will be as successful as we all hope and that in future we will not deal with food legislation in this way, but that it will be dealt with on a United Kingdom basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We should have a single Bill for the United Kingdom as a whole and be done with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.13 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure you will agree, Mr. Leadbitter, that it has been a most constructive debate, and I am very grateful for the constructive attitude of the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Mr. McNamara). I am grateful for the pleasant way in which he discussed beforehand some of the issues that he intended to raise, particularly the matter of smoked fish. I shall deal very briefly with most of the points that have been raised. I am sure that hon. Members will forgive me if I leave out certain of the smaller points that were made, but I shall try to cover the more important ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North raised five substantive points. First, on definitions, he asked why live animals were excluded. The reason is simpler than might perhaps be thought. Live animals are excluded because they are dealt with elsewhere in legislation. It is therefore right to exclude them from the order, otherwise some might believe that they should be included in it. Most live animal legislation is dealt with in animal health legislation and similar measures. Certain live beings that are eaten are covered by the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Colchester, North (Sir A. Buck), who is an aficionado of the oyster, will know that oysters are best eaten live. Indeed, there are some who enjoy the elver, and about £3 5 million worth of eels are produced from Northern Ireland each year. Those are eaten live by some, though I must admit that I tend not to prefer them that way: I prefer them smoked. Indeed, the other day I saw my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Mr. Jessel) eat, as a main course, four starter portions of smoked eel in the Members' Dining Room. I think that Northern Ireland should give him an award for the dedication with which single-handed, he is trying to improve the Northern Ireland economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to consultation with food processors and producers. He is absolutely right. Consultation is extremely important. The order does not insist on consultation on every set of regulations, but before the order was drawn up we consulted 250 interested bodies—producers, district councils and others—and we shall continue to consult widely during the making of the regulations. Consultation is vital for any body of legislation to be accepted, particularly one as sweeping and important as this order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned smoked fish. When he raised the issue with me, I was not aware of the effect of the Food Hygiene (Amendment) Regulations 1990 on mail order smoked fish such as salmon. I am very pleased that a considerable noise was made, not only that made by Mr. Bernard Levin, when the impact of the regulations was discovered. Perhaps I might refer the hon. Gentleman to the answer given by my hon. Friend the Minister for Health concerning five amendments to the regulations, one of which exempts
	<br><q><p>"foods delivered by mail order through the post or by courier to allow industry more time to develop practical means of achieving necessary controls."</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
The answer goes on:
	<br><q><p>"Research studies have been commissioned by Government to identify ways of maintaining product stability in this area and further discussion with industry on practical solutions will be needed."— [	<i>Official Report,</i> 21 February 1991; Vol. 186, c.245–46.]</p></q>
That was in reply to a question from my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling (Mr. Mitchell). Therefore, I need not say much more than that this matter is fully recognised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are differences nowadays in the composition of smoked salmon from that of some years ago. Food health is vital to the consumer. Food safety is vital. We are not pandering in the slightest to the manufacturers of smoked salmon. As I said at the beginning, we are trying to produce a realistic balance between the food that people like to eat and safety requirements on the production of food.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNamara</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not for one moment suggesting that the Minister was pandering to the manufacturers, quite the contrary—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say the hon. Gentleman was. Mr. McNamara—but can be inform the Committee whether any complaints about the quality of Northern Ireland vacuum-packed fish and food have reached the Department or the producers while the regulations have been in operation? I understand that that is not the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman. As far as I know, there have been no complaints. There may well have been complaints, but I know of none about the quality of smoked fish from Northern Ireland. However, it remains a food hazard if the temperature of such food is raised for a time, and clearly it is right that manufacturers should make certain that their products are safe. The order will have very little impact in Northern Ireland, because smoked fish is not a vast industry, but I hope that it will become a bigger one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I much regret the information that the hon. Member for Londonderry, East (Mr. Ross) gave about the smokery in his constituency. I hope that smoked fish will be an ever-increasing industry in Northern Ireland, as the farming of salmon and other fish increases. However, the Committee will welcome the flexibility in exemptions from the regulations—which include not only smoked fish sent by post, but also the custard tart—in the interests of consumers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned church halls and asked for an exact definition. I mentioned that the use of such occasional premises—they do not need to be church halls—would be on one day a week or less. They will be subject to regulations, which must be put out to consultation. We shall look forward to having detailed suggestions from those affected. In general, we are thinking of up to one day a week as the maximum to exempt a person from registering as a business. The right balance should be achieved quite easily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sell-by dates are set by the food industry. They are dependent on the perishability of the type of food and are normally accompanied by consumption dates, such as "Eat within two days". The Committee will know that "use by" dates will be used in future, following a recent European Community directive on food labelling, and that is therefore not covered by the order. Regulations on labelling, for instance on irradiation, will be presented after consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0218">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
The hon. Gentleman presented his case with his customary courtesy and diligence. He undertook a thorough investigation of the legislation, which does him great credit, and in doing so he has served the Province admirably. There may be only one Member from Northern Ireland on the Committee, but had there been 10 the subject could not have been covered more thoroughly or effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that Northern Ireland was likely to be 18 months behind Great Britain with the legislation. I dispute that. As I said at the beginning, after consultation the great majority of the order should be up and running by the end of May, and certain regulations will come into force a few months after that. We shall not be that far down the line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason why Northern Ireland was not included, in the Food Safety Act, thus avoiding the delay between the operative dates, is that it remains Government policy that legislation on transferred matters, such as food law, must be enacted in Northern Ireland by means of this process. The reason why we do that must be clear to all. Hon. Members may disagree, but it means that Northern Ireland retains a body of its own law, and the Government regard that as desirable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even if there were a devolved parliamentary structure, or any devolved structure, in future, there would be no reason why the law in the United Kingdom should not apply to Northern Ireland. Any law that applied in the United Kingdom would be transferred to the Nothern Ireland statute book.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNamara</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do not bite.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The views of the hon. Member for Londonderry, East, and those of many of his colleagues, are well known. He also knows that there are many who disagree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall continue with matters that relate more to the content of the order than to the procedures of the House. The hon. Gentleman mentioned a number of issues, and if I omit any of them now, I hope that we shall spot them when we read the 	<i>Hansard</i> report on the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman spoke or referred to farm controls and my comment that farmers should consider the use of their property beyond the farm gate. I fully agree with him. I am not in any way saying that farmers should be responsible for the quality of food all the way down the line. I am saying that farmers must consider the quality of food all the way down the line. Farmers have been hurt more than anyone by consumer scares. Those scares are rarely caused by the quality of the food in the first place. The vast majority of those falling ill from contaminated food do so because of the storing or cooking of the food in the home, in hospitals and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not the farmer who should take the blame for that, but farmers should consider the safety of food all the way down the line, because it has an immediate impact upon them. Therefore, I am glad that the order imposes greater controls on people all the way through the food chain. That will help farmers to maintain the quality of food until it reaches the consumer. Indeed, in Northern Ireland we have seen, with companies such as Moy Park, which makes
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
chicken products, that farmers are now proud to have their names on product labels, because they have such confidence in the processing and manufacturing quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned funds. I believe that the funds are sufficient to provide the advice and controls that are necessary, but if they are not, we shall take advice. As I said in my opening speech, we shall willingly consider the matter again, if funds are believed to be inadequate for the purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to women's institutes' cakes, I do not want to kill a marvellous industry by dedicated people. It is a tradition that has existed for thousands of years, it seems, in this country. I have always wondered who made Alfred's cakes. I would not mind betting that he bought them at a women's institute raffle or tombola.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNamara</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a sexist remark. They were burnt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those were less enlightened times than today. I have to admit that I make cakes for women's institute raffles. I certainly would not eat them myself. In future such food will have to comply with provisions as to fitness for human consumption. All food must comply with fitness for human consumption regulations, and I am confident that the cakes baked by women's institute members and groups of that sort will meet the highest standards, as they have traditionally done. What would all of us do without such people?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note what the hon. Gentleman said about water. I do not want to extend the Committee sitting beyond what would be regarded as acceptable, certainly by my hon. Friend the Whip, but the Committee may like to know that the controls on water are covered by Department of the Environment legislation in Northern Ireland, and I am sure the hon. Gentleman need have no fear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to animals slaughtered on farms, accompanying legislation will be introduced which bans the slaughter of animals on farms, even by the farmer for his own consumption. All the slaughtering of animals will be done in properly licensed slaughterhouses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could not agree more with the hon. Gentleman than in his comments about angel dust—clenbuterol. There is no absolute proof at the moment that clenbuterol is harmful to the consumer eating meat that has had clenbuterol added to it. There is certainly harm to those who administer it, if in powdered form. This is a very serious matter. It is a medicine that is covered by the Medicines Act, and it is therefore illegal to administer it without the proper licence. A vet must use it under licence for therapeutic purposes in bovines and horses, and any other use is illegal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is important because consumers deserve to know what goes into the commodities that they purchase. As this medicine is administered clandestinely, it is absolutely wrong that it should be administered. I would far rather that the law were changed so that carcases could be seized and people who administer clenbuterol made to pay a heavier penalty than they do at present through fines which I regard as largely inadequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned enforcement. I believe that the law is tighter than ever. We shall look at the wording of some of the legislation. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for referring to article 14(l)(a). He has done some amazing research. He has certainly done the Committee a service. This paragraph was omitted from the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0219">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
original printing of the order, but it is now in there. The error was picked up. I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on spotting that deliberate mistake, which was clearly put in to see whether he would be as diligent as he normally is. He has proved to the satisfaction of all that he spotted it, and I am grateful. I can therefore say that the order is now complete.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that there have been two printings of the draft order and that a change has been made between the first and the second? If so. the draft order that we are discussing is not the one that was originally laid before the House. Why was the attention of the House not drawn to it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was a pure printing mistake, and I believe that it is conventional to allow printing mistakes to be corrected without any further procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNamara</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. The Minister cannot get away with that, though he can try. If we have been debating an order and the Government intend to seek a recommendation from the Committee that it be accepted, which one are we accepting? Is it the second one, or the first one—with or without article 14(l)(a)? Why has the hon. Member for Londonderry East (Mr. Ross) spent all his time doing this research only to find that he has been wasting his time because the Government have caught up with it and have not informed the House or the bodies involved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. Surely that means that, contrary to popular opinion, orders such as this are amendable. I had always understood that, under the legislation governing their production, they were not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to tell the Committee, and you, Mr. Leadbitter, that the order, as laid, was indeed correct. It was in the earlier draft that the omission occurred. I also understand that it depends on the instructions given to the printer. If the printer makes a mistake, that can be corrected without further ceremony. Therefore, I believe that that matter can now be laid to reset.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I clarify the position? On the face of it, it would appear that there is a problem, because there is a precedent in the House where a clause was left out of a Bill

that was returned from the Lords and Mr. Deputy Speaker had to comply with the wishes of the House on that occasion. However, this is a different situation. The House has instructed this Committee to examine the order as it is. That is the problem. We cannot respond to the point of order in the manner that good common sense might suggest, because we are under an instruction from the House. This instrument is reported back to the House, and if hon. Members have a problem about it of the kind suggested, that is the proper place to raise it, but here we must examine the order as it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful, Mr. Leadbitter. Naturally the Committee will agree entirely with your words, but I think that the matter has been properly dealt with, as it was in the earlier draft that the omission occurred and the order as laid was correct.

The hon. Gentleman's last substantive point related to the difference between registration and licensing. We believe that registration is the best way of making sure that the costs of this procedure are as low as possible, and that regular re-licensing would be a bureaucratic nightmare for all the businesses concerned. Registration is a one-off event. It notifies the district council of a food business in the area. It therefore keeps costs low and bureaucracy down to a minimum, and maximises the care and concern for the consumer. However, we believe that certain businesses such as milk plants, dairy farms and food irradiation plants should be licensed. They will continue to be a licensed, but the rest will be registered.

I thank the Committee for its hard work this morning. I believe that the order has been given the concentrated attention that it deserves. I look forward to its coming into operation at the soonest possible time after the widest possible consultation in Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
