	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed</i> [5 	<i>March</i>]: No. 15, in page 4, line 19, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(d) provide land management grants for agriculture.".—[	<i>Mr. Wilson.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intervened on Tuesday because I believed that the Opposition amendment should be considered carefully by the Committee. I say that as someone who is no great lover of the way in which common agricultural policy is evolving. I speak on behalf of most of the farmers in my constituency when I say that they are concerned deeply about the future. More importantly, as European relations becomes sour they look to Parliament and the Conservative Government to find the ways and means to ensure viable livelihoods for farmers, especially for Scottish upland, mountain and hill-farmers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although my hon. Friend the Minister said that he did
	<br><blockquote><p>"not see an advantage in extending a general power to SNH to pay grants for agricultural management. Indeed, we envisage considerable pitfalls in pursuing such a policy as it would duplicate those powers."—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 5 March 1991; c.186.]</p></blockquote>
this is one occasion when I support the idea of reserve powers. If the amendment was accepted it would mean that when we needed to circumnavigate the CAP we would have the means on the statute book whereby Parliament could fund, for environmental and other heritage reasons, the more effective management of Scottish highlands and uplands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought that there is considerable merit in the amendment. I hope that the Committee will understand that I am considering that possibility, because taxpayers are willing to meet conservation costs and fund projects that will lead to better management. The amendment could contribute to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall say no more as I have dealt effectively with the principal reason why the Committee should accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumfries)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I speak as a farmer with an interest. Farmers are so hard-pressed under the CAP that they welcome money from anywhere
	<span class='label label-info column'>190</span>
to help balance the books. When the Bill is enacted, it would be helpful if the Minister and his colleague Lord Strathclyde produced a booklet that explained to those working in the countryside where they can obtain grants and who will fund them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the greatest Pauline conversions happened when the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food understood that conservation was important for the countryside, but that only occurred in the early 1980s after the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. The Ministry then put its heart into it and had the constructive idea of designating environmentally sensitive areas, which are funded by MAFF and the Scottish Office Agriculture and Fisheries Department. The money for those ESAs, however, comes from Europe. That policy has been a successful innovation, but relatively few areas of Scotland have been designated as ESAs. When SNH comes into operation, the ESA designation must be extended to many more areas—indeed, I would welcome its extension to the whole of Scotland. Farmers who are carrying out conservation work and consequently lowering their output in the interests of the habitat and the landscape should be able to reach management agreements with SNH, as they can now with the Scottish Office Agriculture and Fisheries Department if their land is part of an ESA. We must develop land management agreements in the interests not only of conservation and habitat, but of landscape. That is at the heart of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment has merit, as it would ensure that SNH could bring in land management agreements for agricultural purposes. I believe, however, that the present system could continue, provided that those who are interested are given the necessary information about where they can obtain grants, which at present come from various Government Departments and quangos. There is widespread misunderstanding of what is available to further the aim that we are trying to achieve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to insert a thought. If money is available for agriculture, some of us think that an urgent priority should be to assist the knacker industry. There is an urgent crisis because farmers are unable to bury their animals, and therefore there is a risk of disease. I know about the problem from constituency contacts, but on Radio For this morning the area represented by the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro) in south-west Scotland was highlighted because the absence of the knacker industry and the possibility of much water being polluted by disease. If money is available, that should be the priority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sam Galbraith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Strathkelvin and Bearsden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me reinforce the remarks of the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro) about the confusion that farmers face when seeking grants. There is a plethora of sources. The hon. Gentleman suggested that a booklet should be produced by the Scottish Office to supply that information. Will the Minister consider whether that should also be a function of SNH? It could be a one-stop bureau and redirect farmers to the bodies from which grants are available. It is difficult for farmers to know where they should
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0112">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>191</span>
go to obtain those moneys and, like the hon. Member for Dumfries, I believe that more information should be made available. Perhaps SNH could perform that role.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in what my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro) said about a booklet, and I shall follow up his request with my colleague in the Scottish Office who is responsible for agriculture, as I believe that as much information as possible should be made available. Those who are entitled to do so should be able to claim and receive grants in accordance with their entitlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With reference to ESAs, a review will take place and a consultation will be issued in the near future. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) that those who live in the countryside must have viable livelihoods, but we are increasingly tied to European Community grant schemes. Although there are adequate arrangements under the agricultural provisions, SNH can negotiate management agreements under section 49A of the Countryside (Scotland) Act 1967. We are anxious to avoid duplication—the same grant being paid from two separate sources—as that would lead to confusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are doing our best to integrate broader environmental objectives into agricultural support schemes. That offers a more effective approach to promoting farming practices that respect the countryside. The European Commission takes a similar view and is developing its own ideas for reforming the common agricultural policy. We have made some progress by extending environmental conditions in the set-aside scheme last year and by including some environmental conditions in a pilot extensification scheme. Those schemes are intended to reduce the production of surplus farm produce and should help to reduce the pressures for intensive farming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also considering ways in which to extent that approach by developing the hill livestock compensatory allowance scheme to make more specific the environmental benefits that that scheme already offers. We intend to extent the countryside premium scheme, which is operated on a pilot basis in six English counties and which offers positive incentives to farmers who participate in the set-aside scheme to enhance the environmental features of set-aside land. The ESA scheme provides for agriculture departments within the respective Ministries to enter into managment agreements with farmers in the areas designated and to pay grants to promote environmentally friendly land managment practices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress to my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North that it would be unnecessary to give SNH those powers as that would involve duplication, although I appreciate the point that he makes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister will remember that not long ago, I approached him and our colleague in the other place, who is responsible
	<span class='label label-info column'>192</span>
for agriculture, about the problems that we face in the Tay valley, following extensive flooding in February 1990.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We found that there was no vehicle through which we could do anything for conservation or environmental problems. I believe that the managment in that vast area in the Tay valley would have benefited from this clause had such legislation been on the statute book. That is the sort of innovative thinking that we need. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will accept that I have a fertile mind and that I try to find ways and means of getting things done. In the absence of statutory powers to plug into the Europeans' obvious wish to provide for conservation and protection of wildlife and natural habitats in the Tay valley, this proposal would be a splendid way in which to achieve a management scheme that works.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask about the financial priorities? I repeat my question about the knacker industry. This morning, we heard the insouciance and naivety of Lord Strathclyde, which could have come only from a man who has never been elected by anybody for anything in his life. It is an urgent problem, and if we are talking about agricultural financial priorities, what will the Government do to save an industry, which is probably a hard one in which to work, but which is essential? It is unreal to expect farmers to bury their own dead stock, which must be buried pretty deep. Anyone who knows anything about hill farming knows that that is unreasonable and we rely on that industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and Kinross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell). There is a grave risk that one of the principal services that is essential to agriculture could disappear in the near future. We cannot allow that to happen. It would be like abandoning lavatory services—it is that serious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In common with the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell), I have been raising that matter with Ministers for no less than 15 months. After the bovine spongiform encephalopathy scare and the subsequent Government regulations on the rendering business, those involved in the knacker industry could go out of business. I accept that knackering and rendering may be outwith the scope of SNH, but it is a serious problem and must be considered for receipt of agricultural support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For a farmer like me, it is a major operation to have to bury a cow. There is no system whereby a fallen beast can be uplifted. That problem applies mainly to cattle, but, as we are approaching the lambing season, there will be many dead ewes in the next six to eight weeks. It is important that a system of pump-priming assistance is established to provide incinerators or disposal units on farms. The problem will not be solved unless the Government take action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have allowed hon. Members to put the matter on the record, but I hope that they will not pursue it as it is rather wide of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0113">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>193</span>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall send a full reply to the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) and to my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro) about the issue. I understand that Scottish Enterprise and local enterprise companies can assist with the problem. The possibility of incinerators being installed on farms in certain cases is under consideration. I shall respond fully about the matter in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And urgently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman appreciates that the matter is slightly wide of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) referred to flood prevention. We have provided funding for research into that matter. I accept that my hon. Friend would have liked more assistance in that regard, but something has been done and we had a useful Adjournment debate on the matter. The gateway that was suggested by the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) is being considered by the Scottish Agricultural College.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry Bellingham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Norfolk, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 49, in page 5, line 3, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(12)SNH will be authorised to bring in pilot projects designed to assess the viability of reintroducing two previously indigenous species, the wild boar and the wolf.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(13)In the event of the pilot projects in subsection (12) above being deemed successful, and subject to authorisation by the Secretary of State, SNH shall be empowered to reintroduce into the countryside the wild boar and wolf.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(14)SNH will set up a wild boar and wolf monitoring panel which will have powers to pay out compensation to crofters and land owners in respect of damage to crops and livestocks. Appointment to the panel will be by the Secretary of State, but will take into account both fishing and rambling interests."</p></blockquote>
The amendment introduces two new ideas, the first of which would authorise SNH
	<br><blockquote><p>"to bring in pilot projects designed to assess the viability of reintroducing two previously indigenous species, the wild boar and the wolf."</p></blockquote>
If the projects are successful, SNH would be empowered to make such reintroductions. It would also establish a monitoring panel that will have powers to pay compensation to crofters and landowners in respect of damage. After the next general election, several Labour Members may be without seats in the House, as a result of which they may be looking for jobs. The panel could be a way in which they could use their talents and abilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that my hon. Friend was talking about new species; Labour Members are wild boars!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellingham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. and learned Friend would agree that, after the next election, several Labour Members could be looking for ways in which to use their experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>194</span>
Will my hon. Friend the Minister say whether, under existing legislation, the Nature Conservancy Council can grant licences for the reintroduction of species when appropriate? Will he give details of the pilot schemes for new species? I am interested in the pilot scheme for the white-tailed eagle and the red kite. I am not an expert on the law and it may be that my amendment is not properly drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some species have become extinct because of major climatic changes. The moose, lynx and tarpan fit into that category. However, other large mammals have become extinct because of man's activities. Man has persecuted and hunted them to extinction. The aurochs, brown bear, beaver, boar and wolf fit into that category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To put the extinction of those species into context, it is necessary to examine our rural population. In about 1801, the rural population of the British Isles, not including Ireland, was about 8.4 million. In 1911, it had fallen to 5.6 million and in 1990, to 3 million. Those figures are staggering. Much deforestation has taken place since the middle ages, but the process is now being reversed. Throughout the British Isles, including Northern, though not Southern, Ireland, overall woodland cover is 8 per cent and rapidly rising. In the past 20 years there has also been a significant increase in levels of control over organo-chlorine pesticides. The otter is one species that has benefited from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last wolf seen in England was in 1509. Two dates exist for the last wolf killed in Scotland—1701 and 1743. It was killed on the Findhorn, but no one can decide which date is correct. I asked the Library to research into when the last wolf was seen in Ireland and was staggered to find that the date was 1961. I am sure that that date will surprise the Committee, but I have had it confirmed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the aims of the new body will be to embark on creative conservation. What does that term imply? I believe that SNH must examine the possibility of reintroducing several extinct indigenous species. When I first tabled the amendment it was unfairly ridiculed in the media. It has given rise to much correspondence. I have received many letters from responsible biologists and zoologists throughout the country. Dr. D. W. Yalden is an eminent lecturer in the department of zoology at Manchester university. He sent me a copy of his recent paper, "Opportunities for reintroducing British mammals", and provided much detail about the NCC national nature reserve on Rhum, where he carried out research. He pointed out that when the NCC acquired Rhum, it had a population of 1,700 domestic sheep, which were removed, and 1,500 deer. His paper states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At that time, the island appeared severely overgrazed, and about 16 per cent of the Deer starved to death each winter…The level of culling was increased to about one sixth of the population each year, that is about 250 deer; even so a further 4 per cent of the Deer still die of starvation each year (some 60 Deer), so that the culling has not eliminated natural mortality; nor is it sufficiently precise to remove all of the weak, or potentially weak, deer."</p></blockquote>
Dr. Yalden then carefully examined recent studies of wolf predation on the Isle Royale, which is in Quebec, Canada. Most studies show that a wolf requires 3.6 kg of meat daily. If a stag weighs 120 kg
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0114">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>195</span>
a hind 90 kg and a lactating hind 70 kg, the cull on Rhum would produce about 25,500 kg of meat which would sustain a population of roughly 19 wolves. The paper goes into great detail and is backed up by other research conducted by zoologists and biologists. They make a powerful case for the reintroduction of the wolf on the island of Rhum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past, there has been a great deal of media emotion about the danger that the wolf presents to the human species, and many of those reports have been grossly exaggerated. After all, it is easy for the press to whip up great excitement about the issue. We know that the wolf is a vagrant animal. Recently one wolf in Alaska was found to have travelled 700 miles from its den. That is extraordinary, but it shows that wolves travel and I accept that they can damage livestock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other parts of the world where efforts have been made either to reintroduce the wolf or to sustain a dwindling wolf population. In Yellowstone park in the west of the United States of America, attempts to bring back the wolf met with great resistance. In Sweden, the wolf have been hunted almost to extinction. In Norway, few wolves remain and the last wolf may have been shot in the mid-1980s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked the Library to conduct research into wolves in Scandinavia and, above all, to investigate the degree of emotion that can be generated by the publicity surrounding that species. An article headed "Wolf fever in Norway" cites as an example a wolf that was spotted in the county of Adger, which is about 200 miles south-west of Oslo and is an important livestock area. That particular wolf was suspected of killing sheep. A great deal of publicity ensued and within months the 1973 royal resolution of the Norwegian Crown, which afforded protection for wolves, was amended so that the animal could be shot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservationists kicked up such a tremendous fuss that the matter was debated at length in Cabinet, but even though the animal was one of the very few wolves left, a death sentence was passed on it and a £2,000 bounty placed on its head. On 11 January 1984, the wolf was shot. the article states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The unofficial hunt leader, Lars Saga, had himself photographed pouring champagne over the corpse in his sitting-room. He then drove it to the parliament steps in Oslo where Adger MPS "interviewed" it for TV and radio as part of a media extravaganza that lasted for three days."</p></blockquote>
I hope that similar events will not be repeated here, but that example illustrates the public hype and emotion that can be stirred up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence must be examined carefully. It points overwhelmingly to the fact that the wolf is not an animal that will attack human beings. It is a shy animal and, except when provoked or wounded, it generates no danger. I urge the Minister carefully to consider the idea of a pilot project on the isle of Rhum or to instruct SNH to carry our further research to complement that conducted by Dr. Yalden.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If the pilot studies are carried out and there is overwhelming evidence that it would be ecologically acceptable to bring back the wolf and the boar, those schemes could go ahead. If those studies prove successful, the wild boar and, possibly, the wolf could be introduced south of the border.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wild boar is a different kind of animal to the wolf. It disappeared from England, Scotland and Wales in the 16th century when it was hunted to extinction. The species thrives on deciduous woodland. The great increase in deforestation seriously impinged on the wild boar's habitat. Yet in Europe the boar is highly prolific. In France, Belgium, the Low Countries, Germany, Spain, Portugal and Italy some habitats carry a large population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is evidence that wild boar will damage crops. It is a foraging animal, which goes after food, such as acorns, beechmasts and other forest fruits, but where those food items are in short supply it will forage arable crops, such as sugar-beet and corn. That is a worry to farmers. There has been a big increase in afforestation in Scotland, and in the north there are few crops, so I submit that there is a strong case for introducing pilot studies for the reintroduction of the boar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I alert the Committee to the potential revenue that could ensue. Previously, we debated the need to bring income to rural areas. The fabric of rural communities is delicate. We have already had a lengthy debate about the role of estates and some Opposition Members have been critical of them. Hon. Gentlemen did not mince their words when criticising the proprietors of some large estates. We Conservative Members have argued that estates that are well run do a great deal to support those communities. Were it not for the way in which those estates are managed and for their sporting interests, much of that income would disappear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Huge amounts of money change hands in Europe for boar hunting. Because of their love of boar

	<span class='label label-info column'>197</span>
hunting, parties of Americans and Germans go to virtually every country in eastern Europe, bringing vast sums of money to the rural economies. If we reintroduced the boar into one or two pilot areas, we could consider such boar hunts in Scotland. One or two Opposition Members may throw up their hands in horror, but many foreigners already come to Scotland for sport, which is supported and welcomed by the vast majority of Scottish people. Why not extend those sporting activities on a limited scale, to see how they work in the short term?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have gone on long enough, but there is a moral argument to be made. Conservationists in Britain have been foremost in pressing for action to conserve the tiger in Bengal, the gorilla in Rwanda and the giant panda in China, but what have we done to conserve our own large mammal fauna? The answer is very little. My modest amendment would reverse that trend and I urge the Minister to consider it seriously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There should be a pilot project in Norfolk before we take decisions about Scotland. The hon. Member for Norfolk, North-West (Mr. Bellingham) raised an important matter in which I am deeply interested, and which led me to oppose a recent ten-minute Bill that was introduced by the hon. Member for Amber Valley (Mr. Oppenheim). With that, and this debate in mind, I contacted Mr. Roger Wheater who is the vice-chairman of the National Federation of Zoological Gardens of Great Britain and Ireland. He replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"When we supported the Zoo Licencing Act, we very much hoped that there would be a central Inspectorate, not least because the application of a common standard becomes extremely difficult when it is within the control of such a large number of local authorities and, indeed, a large number of Inspectors. I actually chaired the Working Party on the development of the Secretary of State's Standards and in addition to these we formed notes for local authorities together with a Check List of items to look for during the inspection to try and maintain common standards. In the main, this has probably worked. There has inevitably been the odd hiccup in an Act of this kind but of course the RSPCA and any other animal welfare organisation has the right to take any person involved with zoos or other animal activities to court in respect of cruelty. The government at the time decided they were not prepared to set up a central office and the expense that would entail and hence its position with the local authority.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Mr. Oppenheim is not accurate in his statement that zoos are only inspected after four years and thereafter every six years. There is an annual inspection by the local authority. Some local authorities undertake this themselves with their own vet. Others may involve Inspectors from the Secretary of State's list to advise them on these informal inspections under Section 12(1) of the Act."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, we have heard about tigers in Bengal, so a direct answer from the man who knows about the subject is surely in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The man who knows about the subject is not a member of the Committee, so he cannot make a contribution. I have made a ruling. The hon.

	<span class='label label-info column'>198</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I must follow your ruling, Mr. Martin. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources' species survival commission is currently developing strategies in respect of a wide range of mammals. Part of that strategy involves a recommendation for captive breeding—such an approach would have been unheard of 20 years ago. If captive breeding is to be taken seriously, I hope that the Scottish Office will go to the man who was the chairman of one of the Secretary of State's own committees for an expert opinion. I shall leave it at that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Paice 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cambridgeshire, South-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, North-West (Mr. Bellingham), who has suffered some ridicule from members of the Committee, the press and others on a matter that has aroused widespread interest. There is an important and serious theme in his remarks and I hope that the Government will consider it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to encourage and develop the diversity of wildlife that this country had formerly—there is no reason why we should not have it again. A long list of flora and fauna has become extinct in the past few centuries. The amendment refers to two, but there are many others. There is no reason why the principle of reintroducing species into the wild should not be more widespread. That practice is happening with one or two bird species, and it should be extended to mammals as the two species mentioned in the amendment have considerable attributes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the comments that we have heard do not do justice to the importance of the matter. There is no reason why the wolf could not be reintroduced into certain restricted areas where trials could be properly monitored, such as islands where it could be properly contained. There is no logic in opposing the amendment simply for the sake of doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same could be said of the wild boar, although I suspect that there are certain parts of Scotland that the wild boar would not find very hospitable. There is no reason why it should not live alongside a certain amount of rural populations, just as it does throughout Europe. I hope that the Government will seriously consider increasing both the range of wildlife and the opportunity for people to experience and understand all aspects of nature in their own country. They would then not have to travel to somewhat more exotic places, although I believe that the highlands of Scotland is one of the most exotic places in the world. We would add to that attraction by providing a greater diversity of wildlife, as suggested by the amendment, which would enhance the highlands' high-standing. I suspect that I already know what my hon. Friend the Minister will say about the amendment, but I hope that he will not treat it with too much disrespect, as it represent a serious attempt to do something about increasing the natural resources of this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all agree that the contribution from the hon. Member for Norfolk, North-West (Mr. Bellingham) was most interesting. I cannot believe
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0116">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>199</span>
that ridicule has been levelled against him by anyone on his well-structured and serious amendment. He mentioned the island of Rhum as a typical place for the reintroduction of such species. We know that the principle is already established, as the sea eagle has been reintroduced, so that principle has been adopted by the NCC and will be by SNH.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not share the antagonism of the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs Michie) for the current structure of the isle of Rhum. I believe that it is a rather splendid island, which is easy to reach and great work on nature conservation has been done there. I have a vested interest in the reintroduction of the wild boar on Rhum. One of the great problems that I have when I go there is that the local shop is closed and I become fed up eating venison and salmon for breakfast every morning. A little bacon from a wild boar would make a pleasant change. There would be benefits that even the hon. Member for Norfolk, North-West has not appreciated from a few wild boar charging around the island.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure what benefit would be gained from the wolf, but if it eats midges that would be an advantage. The midges on Rhum are some of the largest to be found anywhere in this country. If the wolf was a predator of those, I might support its reintroduction on the island. The amendment should not be dismissed with ridicule and laughter. There are serious matters to consider such as breakfast or getting rid of midges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing endangered species. The hon. Member for Norfolk, North-West suggested that that might include Labour Members of Parliament, but Tory Members are undoubtedly an endangered species. The principle of preserving such species is important and SNH might have a role to play in that. Tory Members will not be preserved by retaining their seats, but perhaps SNH could designate their former constituencies as sites of special scientific interest, although we should not have appeals procedures. We could even have theme parks set up by SNH, such as the "Chingford", which could contain the polecat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the amendment relate to the culling of deer? I was absent from the debate on deer, but one of the reasons for the large numbers of deer is the loss of species such as the wolf and wild boar. The hon. Gentleman would like to introduce a pilot scheme. The problem is that his proposal might also result in the culling of humans. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman believes that a spin-off from that scheme would be the resolution of the problem of the honeypot effect, about which everyone is worried.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Braemar was mentioned as an appropriate site for the reintroduction of the two species—perhaps the Duke of Atholl's estate or Inverary castle would be suitable. Although the time has not yet arrived for such action the principle has already been established with the sea eagles on the splendid isle of Rhum. I hope that the Minister will make constructive comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>200</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under clause 14 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 it is illegal to release into the wild any wild animal that is not normally resident in this island. However, clause 16 of the Act provides almost every conceivable escape route to allow the release of wildlife for many purposes—scientific, educational, photographic and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members have rightly said that the sea eagle experiment on Rhum has been a great success. I hope also that the numbers of red kites in Wales and on the Black Isle will increase. However, there are disadvantages in introducing animals into the wild. Minks have been released into the wild by animal rights people who did not appreciate the consequences of their action. I recently read an article about how rats, escaping from a shipwreck, invaded Ailsa Craig. Therefore, the vast number of sea birds that used to nest on that island can do so no longer. Sika and Muntjak deer are now becoming pests, having moved steadily north.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should encourage the constructive increase of wildlife in Scotland—that will be close to the heart of SNH. However, we should remember that if things go wrong, the results can be very serious, as happened with rabbits in Australia. One should be careful before embarking upon such reintroduction and schemes. I am glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, North-West (Mr. Bellingham) said that the amendment would introduce a pilot scheme. My goodness, it would have to be well controlled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs Michie) was a little hard on Rhum. It is a wonderful place, and several of its residents are employees of the NCC. I remember presenting prizes at the school, which had 10 or 12 pupils, so it is not an uninhabited island. A decision to increase the population greatly would have to be balanced against the important wildlife and scientific developments on the island.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a useful debate, but we should proceed with great caution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. friend the Member for Norfolk, North-West (Mr. Bellingham) for introducing the concept of increasing the species of indigenous fauna.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many species of flora, such as the rhododendron which was introduced from India, are not indigenous to Scotland. I wonder why my hon. Friend stopped at wild animals of unattractive form that have not existed in Scotland for three centuries or more, and why he did not extend the concept to the introduction of others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why did my hon. Friend not suggest that other species of fauna, which are no longer indigenous to Scotland but were a short time ago, should be reintroduced in a pilot scheme or otherwise? The poor old bedbug is now extinct in Scotland, as are the flea, except in cats and dogs, and the liver fluke. Taenia pisiformis, the cat-rabbit tapeworm, is almost extinct in Scotland. If we are to return to our original fauna, we should consider mammoth hunts. The sabre-toothed tiger used to be resident in Scotland—if we cannot preserve the tiger in India, why not have it in the Cairngorms or in some of the Scottish
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0117">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>201</span>
Nationalist seats? That would be an excellent pilot scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We could introduce in abundance poisonous snakes which used to roam Scotland and we could have a shot at looking for dinosaurs. We should have a pilot scheme to see whether we can get the Loch Ness monster to breed and we should consider whether the wolves that my hon. Friend wishes to introduce should be dressed in sheep's clothing, so that the uplands of Scotland appear still to be inhabited by sheep. That would ensure a further drop in the rural population, which I thought my hon. Friend was anxious to prevent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to hear that my hon. Friend thought that the lynx and the brown bear would be suitable. The hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) would, I think, have a happy relationship with brown bears from time to time. They crush you to death when they shake hands, but a population of brown bears in Scotland would be delightful. As the Minister of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) knows, there are lions in his constituency, and there is no reason why they should be encaged. Councillor Connaughty would make a good Sunday lunch for one of the lions in my hon. Friend's constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, North-West has been modest in his proposals. We could extend them to flora and introduce the muscarine toadstool, so that children out for a walk would be likely to die if they ate it. We could have alligators in Barlinnie to keep down the prison population, and crocodiles in the seaside resorts of Lanarkshire, so that the tourist honeypot effect is not exaggerated. Scotland could become a Palaeolithic zoo with the most wonderful flora and fauna. We could have baby-eating dingoes from Australia—that would control the population crisis. My hon. Friend has struck on a seam which I trust that my hon. Friend the Minister will make the principal part of a new statute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. May I register, for the benefit of those reading the report of our proceedings, the fact that Parliament can discuss alligators in Barlinnie, but the considered judgment of the director of Edinburgh zoo is ruled out of order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is challenging the ruling of the Chair.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an unusually interesting debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, North-West (Mr. Bellingham) made a well-researched speech and got his teeth throughly into it. We hope that we can prevent any of the beasts having an opportunity of getting their teeth into him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) raised the matter of Dr. Roger Wheater's contribution. Both of us know him. Wolves exist in Scotland; they are kept in Edinburgh zoo. I should like to recount what happened when they escaped
	<span class='label label-info column'>202</span>
and roamed around: Mr. Wheater shot them dead. However, later he said that he regretted having to do so because they probably were not a danger, but the thought of wolves prowling around mothers with babies in prams was a risk that he, as a director of Edinburgh zoo, was not prepared to take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there are those who believe that the wolf has been a much maligned creature and that it has a relatively amiable disposition. However, those who try to rehabilitate the wolf have their work cut out. Many centuries of fear of ravenous wolves have made their mark on our language. If my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, North-West has his way, those expressions may no longer be just figures of speech. Our hills would again echo to the shepherd boy's cry of "Wolf!". We might even have to "keep the wolf from the door" and the fate of Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother could become a regular item in our newspaper. A wolf whistle could take on a more menacing connotation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When sitting next to Masefield at a banquet at Holyrood, the Aberdonian artist Sivett asked him what he did. Masefield said that he wrote poetry. Sivett said, "Does that bring in a sufficiency?" "Yes", replied Masefield, "it keeps the wolf from the door." Sivett replied, "Oh, I suppose you just read your poems to the wolf."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The term "keeping the wolf from the door" arose from the fear that wolves could become aggressive if they were hungry. I do not thing that my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, North-West has read the delightful children's book "The Wolves of Willoughby Chase" by Joan Aitken. The author explains that the action takes place in a period of British history that never happened—shortly after the accession to the throne of Good King James III in 1832. A channel tunnel had been completed some years before and many wolves, driven out of France by severe winters, had migrated through the tunnel to the British Isles. An early scene in the book describes a desperate attack by a ravenous horde of wolves on humans on a train on its way north from London. We do not wish to risk turning fiction into reality, especially with the channel tunnel so well advance. As the reference to James III, a Stuart, suggests, there are some cases when it is simply impossible to turn back the clock to 1703, which was the last known date of a wolf offending in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with great interest to the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, North-West and to that of my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridgeshire, South-East (Mr. Paice). I accept that there is a strong case for reintroducing certain species, and I shall explain in a moment how my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro) covered such matters some years ago when he took the Wildlife and Countryside Bill through the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not aware of previous proposals to reintroduce the wild boar which, when roused, is a known danger to humans. However, the possibility of reintroducing wolves has been raised from time to time by naturalists and conservationists, such as the late
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0118">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>203</span>
David Stephen. For what I assume would be a pilot study, Rhum was suggested as a suitable location for the reintroduction of wolves. That suggestion was made long before my hon. Friend tabled his amendment. As there is some doubt about whether wolves ever lived on Rhum, people will naturally wonder why that island has been chosen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the view of some conservationists, Rhum offers unique advantages as an experimental site. The island is owned and managed by the NCC. The council considered the matter and, at an official level, gave some preliminary thought to the idea. However, I am not aware that it ever published a report on it. If it did, it certainly did not allow Ministers to see the report. Clearly, such a proposal would require detailed assessment and meticulous monitoring, and the NCC, in its wisdom, decided that it did not have the necessary resources for the scheme. It was worried that the people of Rhum would not be enthusiastic about the idea and that they would be alarmed by the eagerness of hardline, extreme conservationists. The council decided not to allow the idea to be put to Ministers, nor to consider the possibility in the foreseeable future. I have no intention of asking the council to consider the subject again, but I have asked it to do research in other cases—for example, into the preservation of that great bird, the Scottish capercaillie.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the wolf. Although the wolf is a natural predator of deer, it would not be a satisfactory means of culling deer. Wolves would prey on the weaker animals, and would therefore be selective. They could cause an overall increase in the deer population, so they do not represent an effective means of culling of deer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What are the Government doing about the capercaillie?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are discouraging shooting, because the numbers have dropped to about 2,000, but there is no statutory ban on that. The major risk to capercillie is the loss of habitat, so we have made resources available for further research to increase that habitat. The birds fly fast, so, even when they are shot at, many are not hit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, I have shot them in the Black wood. The problem with shooting them is that they continue to fly fast even when dead, so if one does not get out of the way, one may be killed. And they are inedible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend says that they are inedible, but I am told by gamekeepers that they taste of pine needles.
	<span class='label label-info column'>204</span>
However, shooting is discouraged where the numbers have dropped. Research on how to protect the bird is on-going.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulties in reintroducing wolves would be immense, not least on Rhum. The NCC did not float the idea of a local referendum on that as did the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) for Sunday sailings. It seems that wolves on Rhum are thought to be even more controversial than Sunday sailing to the Western Isles—the hon. Gentleman will appreciate that that is saying something.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, North-West is not strictly necessary, because of the work of my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro) who introduced the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Section 14 of that Act makes it an offence to introduce species into Great Britain that are neither ordinarily resident here nor regular visitors to this country, without a licence granted by the Secretary of State. My hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries mentioned mink but what about a species that may exist in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, North-West—the coypu, an aggressive rat with large fangs that is regarded in many areas as a form of vermin? That reintroduction was unwelcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new licensing regime would allow SNH to reintroduce to Scotland any previously indigenous species if that were considered appropriate, but wolves and wild boar do not fit into that category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) mentioned the sea eagle and the red kite, which have been reintroduced successfully by the NCC. There are several pairs in Scotland today, although unfortunately some red kites have been poisoned. We hope that those species will thrive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will fall to SNH to consider in the first instance what species might be reintroduced, and how. If my hon. Friend has other less controversial, more modest proposals, I suggest that he writes to the Nature Conservancy Council for Scotland, stating his case. Any application for a licence will be given careful consideration by the Secretary of State if it is supported by the NCCS. I have no doubt that were the reintroduction of some species thought appropriate, the process would be carefully monitored and strictly controlled, as it was for the reintroduction of the sea eagle and the red kite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the powers already available to SNH through the 1981 Act, which was entirely the work of my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries, I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, North-West will not feel it necessary to press this ingenious, but not strictly necessary, amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most disappointed with that reply as it leaves me to have boring breakfasts of salmon and venison when next I go to Rhum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will SNH try to re-establish something even more difficult—the village shop on Rhum? Although the Minister cannot reintroduce the wild boar to Rhum, perhaps he can get us a village shop, which would remove the need for that boar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellingham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his remarks. I am particularly pleased to hear him confirm that existing legislation will give SNH the power to apply for a licence to reintroduce particular species. I accept entirely that the purpose of the amendment was to start a general debate. We shall have to keep coming back to the subject as it is an important factor in building up Scotland's natural heritage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the amendment would have caused difficulties. One must bear in mind, however, that wolves and wild boars were indigenous to Scotland. They bear no comparison with rabbits, mink or coypu, which were accidentally introduced to Scotland. There was no pilot scheme for the introduction of mink and coypu, they simply escaped and bred with great profusion. I am talking about carefully controlled pilot schemes. If we ever see the day when the wolf and the wild boar are reintroduced, it will be under a pilot scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, having heard today's debate, SNH will look carefully at the expert research into the subject. That research will continue. I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to do what he can to encourage SNH to take seriously the on-going process of reintroducing species. The process that started with great success. Given what my hon. Friend the Minister has said about the existing law, I shall withdraw the amendment. Doubtless, we can come back to it on Report and possibly in the other place.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 64, in page 5, line 22, after "the", insert "owner,".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a sensible, tidying-up amendment. I await the Government's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) for raising this matter. I share his concern to safeguard the interest of the owner in relation to SNH's powers of entry. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that we have already mentioned the clause in another place to provide for service of notice on the owner where practicable and payment of compensation for any damage caused by exercise of the powers of entry, as well as a procedure for SNH to obtain a warrant from the sheriff in certain circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) entitles the occupier of the land to demand that the person seeking entry produces evidence of his authority to exercise the powers under that provision. It comes into play at the time SNH
	<span class='label label-info column'>206</span>
is actually going to exercise its powers, having given appropriate notice to the occupier and, where practicable, the owner. At that stage it is the person who is in actual occupation of the land who has the immediate interest of ensuring that the SNH representative coming on to the land is duly authorised. That person may be the owner or anyone in lawful occupation of the land, such as a tenant. If the owner is not himself the occupier, it is impracticable to allow him to require the SNH official to produce evidence of his authority when he first arrives on the land, because, obviously, the owner is not himself there. If the owner is in occupation, the provision is already drafted in terms that cover his interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that explanation, I trust that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Everything hinges on the key words "where practicable". I listened carefully to the Minister's explanation and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Ray Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 26, in page 5, line 25, after "entry", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"detailing the purpose of the visit".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 27, in page 5, line 25, after "to", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"and has been received by".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments relate to the clause governing entry to land by officers of SNH. It provides that people authorised by SNH may enter land at any reasonable time provided that 14 days' notice has been given. The clause originally specified seven days' notice and I am pleased that those in another place made a convincing case for increasing that notice. Communications are sometimes uncertain in many of the remoter areas of Scotland, especially the islands. For example, a letter posted before the weekend may not be delivered until some time in the following week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This matter arose in the debate on the Criminal Justice Bill. I believe that even 14 days' notice is not enough. Most people do not go on holiday for less than 14 days and whenever a letter is posted, it may arrive in the 14 days when they are away. I see nothing in the clause that suggests that there must be evidence of its receipt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman. I had intended to discuss evidence of receipt because that is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have acknowledged the importance of providing written notification of visits by accepting a period of notice of 14 days, which is an increase on seven days—there may even be a case for extending it to 21 days. They have also acknowledged the importance of evidence of receipt of a letter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 27 would require confirmation that a letter had been received. We could have asked
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0120">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>207</span>
for 21 days' notice, but that might have delayed an essential visit. I want to ensure that the right people have been informed and that notification of an intended visit has been received. That could be done either by including a request in the original letter to confirm its receipt or by asking SNH to send all notifications by recorded delivery, to be signed for by the correct persons. Surely, that would leave no room for doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 26 proposes that the letter should clearly state the purpose of the visit. That is a simple request. The person whose land is to be visited should have no reason to dispute a visit by SNH—under the proposed legislation he has no right to object to it. I propose that a statutory obligation should be imposed on SNH to outline the purpose of the visit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A person whose land is to be visited has the right to know why. The amendment would also guard against abuses by persons authorised by SNH who might request access to land for purposes other than those specified in the clause. If the amendment is accepted, there will be no dispute over the reason why a visit is to be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 6(10), SNH will be required to pay compensation for any damage done to property during a visit. Any dispute regarding the merit and purpose of a visit that arises in a discussion on damage and/or compensation would be well served by the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both of those requirements should be included in the Bill because, without them, a great deal will be left to trust and supposition. If the amendments are accepted, those whose lands are visited will feel more confident and reassured about what is going on. In island communities that include elderly crofters or farmers, anxiety is often expressed about letters that arrive saying that people will be coming to view the land. Anxiety will also be caused if people have not received letters from SNH because they have been away, as the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir Nicholas Fairbairn) said, or for other reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such things have caused worry in the past and I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although the amendment is not significant in many ways, it goes to the heart of the problems that we have encountered in the past with SSSIs. Relationships between individuals and the NCC and other public bodies have been questioned in the past. The hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs Mitchie) wants to make it more certain that negotiations are conducted in the proper spirit and, for that reason, the amendments are important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even in these modern days, things can go wrong. I was having a bite of lunch in my dining room when, to my amazement, I saw surveyors setting up theodolites on my front lawn. I live a mile and a half from the A74 and those surveyors, without a word to anyone, decided that they would survey a possible route through my garden. That is typical of the approach taken by some who do not think. Those
	<span class='label label-info column'>208</span>
surveyors had set up shop and started surveying without even asking my permission to enter my front gate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the surveyors know whose front lawn it was?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They did not know whose lawn it was when they entered, but they certainly did a few moments later. Shortly afterwards, I received profuse apologies from the Scottish Office. I learnt that those people came from a surveying company employed under contract by the Scottish Office. That example shows what can happen when there are bad relations between organisations and the public and people do not think about what they are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is good news that the Bill insists on 14 days' notice but, as the hon. Lady and my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir Nicholas Fairbairn) pointed out, that may still be insufficient time to notify the owner or occupier of the land if he has been away or if a letter was not sent by recorded delivery.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee should know that I had the honour of being present at Williamwood when the surveyor appeared on the lawn. As my hon. Friend had been the author, sponsor and accoucheur of the M74, it seemed to me poetic justice that he should have the benefit of it passing through his farm and garden. At the time, my hon. Friend thought that the surveyor had attempted to shoot him because a projectile came through the drawing room window. In fact, the gardener had managed to send a stone in his direction, and my hon. Friend suffered a considerable neurotic spell.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was accentuated by the company that was then present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When there is real urgency and damage is being done to property—perhaps, within a site of special scientific interest—there are procedures for conservation whereby court action can be taken. However, for most of the time, SNH will not operate under desperate time constraints. We should ensure that owners and occupiers are given plenty of notice and know what is happening as that would mean that everyone could work towards the right solution positively and in good part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the amendment important in relation to the appeals procedure that could follow? As I understand it, licences are issued to persons on the condition that they can be exercised on land only with the consent of owners or occupiers, because licensees might not know where the species to which a licence relates is at the time a licence is exercised. SNH could not consult such owners and occupiers in advance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another excepton is the rare use of compulsory purchase powers, which SNH will use to protect nationally important nature conservation sites as a measure of last resort. By definition such powers are not used with owners' or occupiers' consent. I should like to ask the Minister whether that is right?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0121">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>209</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is necessary for the appropriate notice to be given. The 14 clear days' notice to which my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro) referred excludes the date of posting and the date of receipt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the purpose of the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs Michie) and I share her concern that SNH's powers of entry should be exercised with due regard for the interests of owners and occupiers of the land in question. However, I do not believe that the amendments are necessary or desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The requirement in clause 6 to give notice of intended entry is well precedented in water, planning and pollution control legislation, and also, as regards the NCC and Countryside Commission for Scotland, in the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and the Countryside (Scotland) Act 1967. In none of those is it spelled out that a notice should state the purpose for which entry is sought. In fact, the purposes for which entry may be sought are always specified in the statutory provision itself. Any notice given by SNH would in all likelihood quote the relevant purpose from subsections (1) and (2), whether, for example, it is to assess a claim for compensation made by the owner or with a view to making an access order, so that, if challenged, SNH can be shown to be acting properly within its powers. I am not aware of any difficulty in that regard with existing powers of entry of the NCC and CCS. To make such an amendment to the new power of entry might suggest that existing powers were deficient in that respect, which would be unwarranted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any event, subsection (6) already provides adequate protection for owners or occupiers. If they do not admit SNH on to land, SNH may go to a sheriff for a warrant authorising entry. Sheriffs will not grant warrants unless they are satisfied that not only the purpose for entry onto land is within the scope of clause 6, but the purpose is reasonable. It is through that judicial process that SNH's use of its powers of entry is controlled. The ultimate sanction is a sheriffs refusal to grant a warrant. The amendment would give rise to arguments over whether the purpose of a visit was specified in sufficient detail in a notice. It would not give any additional protection to owners or occupiers beyond that in subsection (6).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 27 is inappropriate given the terms of clause 24, which represents a standard provision. It allows for service of documents in person, by post or delivery or, when the name and address of an owner or occupier of land cannot be ascertained or when land is unoccupied, by leaving the document with any person employed or resident on the land or affixing it to some building or object on the land. That latter aspect of the clause is essential in practice. It is not possible to provide at the same time that each notice should be received by the occupier. Furthermore, the only way in which to obtain firm evidence of receipt of the notice would be to serve each notice in person, which would be wholly impracticable. Clause 24 is a standard provision that deals with the service of documents, and there is no reason to deprive SNH of the flexibility that that provision provides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>210</span>
The hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) raised an interesting matter. SNH will have powers of entry under both the Bill and the 1981 Act. Those under the 1981 Act are limited to nature conservation orders. In the light of those comments, I hope that the hon. Lady will not press her amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Ray Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his answer, and to Conservative Members for their support. If SNH reads the report of our proceedings, I am sure that it will understand that there have been problems in the past and I hope that it will want to ensure that they do not happen again. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"and in doing so will take into account the additional costs of an enhanced regional structure".</p></blockquote>
This is a probing amendment to obtain assurances from the Minister about the finances of SNH. He has already given many assurances on the matter, so I shall not delay the Committee for long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will merge two organisations. That usually provides economies of scale, but it may be slightly different in the case of SNH because it will have a proactive and more outgoing role than its predecessors. The aim of the chairman of SNH and its members is to provide a more enhanced regional structure, with staff and field officers located in various regional offices. Although I do not wish to prejudge the location of SNH's administrative headquarters, Battleby would be a rather splendid location. I am worried not so much about the buildings as about the work that the staff want to undertake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During our discussions many issues have been raised, including wild boars. We are concerned about national parks, which are not covered by the Bill, and sites of special scientific interest. Part of the problem with those sites is caused not by their designation or scientific basis, but by how they have been dealt with in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The aim of the new body is to have a more sensitive, extensive and outgoing regional and district structure to prevent that problem from happening again. Such a structure would be a better way of dealing with SSSIs than an appeals procedure. The enhanced regional structure with more staff and field officers requires adequate money to ensure that the body can carry out its functions properly. We want to prevent problems from occurring and to encourage conservationists to work with those interested in conservation and the owners of the land that is involved. That is why we tabled the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) recognises that we intend a devolved decision-making and operating structure for SNH. There will be several regional boards providing the basis for its operation. Those will be developed from the regional boards that will be established by the Nature Conservancy Council for Scotland over the coming year. Furthermore, again building and expanding on existing local offices of the Nature Conservancy Council, SNH will have a wide geographical network to facilitate its operations throughout Scotland. I was interested to hear the hon. Gentleman's strong support for Battleby, which we envisage will have a central role in the activities of SNH.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we consider this to be such a crucial aspect of SNH, we will ensure, when making a grant to the body, that the funding is sufficient to cover all its needs in relation to its structure. Obviously, in assessing the level of grants that will be made to SNH in any year, we shall consider all its operations and priorities for that year. It would be unusual and is wholly unnecessary to single out one of those in the Bill, as the amendment suggests. I trust that the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden will understand that. By approving the terms of the amendment, we may create the impression that no other aspects of the work of SNH are worthy of such consideration in assessing its grant level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not doubt that the degree of devolution that we propose will be more resource intensive than a heavily centralised structure. Members of the Committee will be well aware of the problems of over-centralisation for previous bodies operating under previous legislation. We are intent on establishing a body that is effective in reducing conflict and in building partnerships at local and regional level. That cannot be accomplished, as I hope the Committee will agree, without developing a decentralised structure. As the financial memorandum explains, there will be offsetting savings in other areas, so the effect on public expenditure of setting up SNH will be only a slight increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I again reassure the Committee that the regional structure will be properly funded, as will the whole body, so I hope that the hon. Gentleman will see fit to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the regional structure would be properly funded. Will he expand on that? It is a matter over which there is a big question mark in many minds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The grant in aid to the CCS for 1991–92 shows an increase of £600,000, and further increases in 1992–93 and 1993–94 for the public expenditure period will give resources totalling more than £21 million. We believe that those resources will provide the CCS, and later SNH, with a strong
	<span class='label label-info column'>212</span>
base for developing key programmes, such as improving landscape quality, increasing recreation provisions and securing access, which I know that the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden considers, rightly, to be extremely important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>", including a list detailing the names of any person or public body given financial assistance under section 8, above, together with an account of the assistance given, and a similar list detailing payments made to persons who have entered into an agreement with SNH or who have received compensation from SNH as a consequence of an order confirmed by the Secretary of State".</p></blockquote>
I hope that this can be a quick debate. I intend to build on the Minister's comments in a previous debate when I moved an amendment relating to freedom of environmental information and public access to information about SNH. Amendment No. 56 would make publicly available information relating to grants and other payments to be made by the new body to various individuals and other bodies under clause 8. I want to ensure that the new body will follow the best practice of the Countryside Commission, rather than the more secretive practice of the Nature Conservancy Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Page 138 of the NCC's most recent annual report states that it paid £7.7 million in the previous year for various forms of management agreement affecting nature reserves and sites of special scientific interest. Most of that money would not have been spent in Scotland, although a considerable portion would have been.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Page 126 is the only part of the NCC's annual report to detail that expenditure and the details are very general. It lists the various regions of Scotland in which expenditure was incurred. It provides information about the amount of hectarage, the general habitat, whether woodland, neutral grassland, coastland or open water, and the period for which expenditure was incurred. The table provides details of the amounts, but does not state who received the various grants and payments, or what the recipients were expected to do in return for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By contrast, appendix D of the most recent annual report of the Countryside Commission for Scotland provides a detailed table of the expenditure incurred. It lists the names of the people who received payments, and states exactly what the payments were for. For example, the part of appendix D that relates to highland regions lists, among those who received
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0123">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>213</span>
money last year, the trustees of the late Ronald K. M. Burns, who received £3,500 to carry out repairs to a reservoir at loch Shandra. Almost £1,500 was paid to D. Y. Bishop and Co. for community tree planting in Kirriemuir. The Duke of Atholl received £2,500 for a management plan of gardens and a designed landscape at Blair Castle. The Strathmore estate is listed as receiving £750 for the reconstruction of an Italian garden terrace wall and steps at Glamis castle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Extremely detailed information is provided in the CCS report about the money paid, what it was spent on, and who received it. If the CCS can provide such detailed information in its annual report, there is no reason why the NCC has not done so in the past. There is certainly no reason why SNH cannot do so in future. I urge the Government to ensure that SNH's annual reports will follow the best practice that has been established by the CCS.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) is right to stress that the best practice should be followed. I confirm that the practice followed for the annual reports of the CCS will be maintained in future, which is what he wants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware of the hon. Gentleman's concern about freedom of environmental information, a subject on which we touched earlier in Committee in relation to amendment No. 53. That discussion dealt to some extent with the type of material which SNH would include in its annual report, therefore it anticipated our discussion today. As I said then, we should be as open as possible in those matters. There was a slight misunderstanding during the course of that discussion. The hon. Member for Western Isles said that the Countryside Commission for Scotland provided fuller details in its annual report than the NCC about its management agreements. Although the CCS has power under section 49A of the Countryside (Scotland) Act 1967 to enter into management agreements, it has never used that power. The CCS report goes into considerable detail about the grants that it has paid. That is one aspect of amendment No. 53.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be for SNH to decide the level of detail which it would be appropriate to include in its annual report on management agreements or any other subject. I am sure that it will wish to be as open as possible, like its predecessors. Although, as I have said, I am sure that SNH will wish to co-operate as openly as possible and will be more than willing to co-operate with requests from individuals about particular aspects of its work, I cannot accept that it should be bound by statute to provide the sort of detailed information in the amendment referring to agreements. The financial aspects of a management or access agreement are likely to fall within the category of confidential or particularly sensitive information which I exempted from my general remarks about openness of operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment might be counter-productive, because it might deter people from entering into management agreements. That would be undesirable. We want as much openness as possible, without deterring management agreements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>214</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the need for commercial confidentiality, but many of the management agreements concluded by the NCC and the payments made by the CCS could not reasonably be said to involve commercial confidentiality. The projects are not subject to market competition in which the various participants need to keep their activities or the sums received confidential. Will the Minister confirm that it is highly unlikely that the bulk of the moneys that the NCC has paid out through its various management agreements in the past for nature reserves and SSSIs will be subject to the bounds of commercial confidentiality, so that best practice that SNH will follow will not just be in respect of payments that have traditionally been made by the NCC and the CCS?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I expect and hope that those details will be published in the SNH annual report, but it is not necessary to place such a statutory duty on SNH.

We made our intentions plain in an earlier sitting of the Committee and set out our views publicly in the form of a press notice, which has been circulated to members of the Committee. I do not wish to dwell on this subject in detail, but I shall summarise the reasons for the Government not wishing clause 11 to stand part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From a practical point of view, the duty laid on SNH to review all SSSIs within five years of its establishment would be such an onerous burden and a diversionary activity that we doubt whether SNH would be able to devote much effort to the rest of its work. Given our clearly stated intentions, which I am glad to see are widely supported by members of the Committee and by Scottish opinion, from a purely practical point of view we could not countenance such a statutory duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also a much more fundamental reason why we oppose the amendment. I am sure that the Committee will be familiar with the procedures of sections 28 and 29 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. For the benefit of the Committee, however I have put the NCC's explanatory booklet on the present procedures on the Table. I am sure that the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) will be pleased to see that it is published in Gaelic as well as in English. Those procedures—as is now, I hope, well understood—allow representations to be made both about the notification of an SSSI and about any changes in land use that might potentially damage the scientific interest of the site.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are mindful of the concerns expressed in another place and by hon. Members such as my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker). We therefore welcome the new procedures which Magnus Magnusson has developed for the Nature Conservancy Council for Scotland. They will allow more scope for negotiation and consultation. An outline of the procedures and a more detailed note have been put on the table for members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When one of the NCC's regional boards has determined that the scientific interest in an area justifies its designation as an SSSI, an informal approach will be made to owners or occupiers by the appropriate regional board member. The NCC has a duty to notify owners and occupiers, the relevant local authority and the Secretary of State formally. All those parties can make representation, including objections to the regional board. If a resolution cannot be achieved by officials, the regional board will consider the matter again, taking advice on the scientific justification for notification from the NCC's science, research and development board. If that scientific case is sustained, a site meeting will be held. The regional board will then reconsider the case and submit its recommendations to the main board for decision. There is an in-built right of representation to the NCC by relevant parties. We are convinced, as I am sure are Opposition Members,
	<span class='label label-info column'>216</span>
that the new procedures, when applied sensitively, will remove the anxieties that have been expressed about the way in which notification and consent procedures have operated in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to anxieties being removed. Can we take it that the matter has been discussed and accepted by the nongovernmental organisations, especially the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The RSPB has campaigned strongly that the clause should be dropped. That is the gist of its representations that have been sent to all Members of Parliament. I have had to write a huge number of letters in response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to be clear about what the Minister said. He gave the impression that agreement had been reached with many lobbying organisations. It would help the Committee to know which organisations have agreed and which have not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, there have not been specific unilateral agreements between the Scottish Office and individual organisations. General agreement has been reached on not to proceed with the clause in the form in which it was inserted into the Bill in the House of Lords. We have responded to the many organisations that do not wish the clause to remain in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must stress that when a site notification has been confirmed by the council, and a list of operations that would damage the scientific interest has been notified to owners and occupiers, it is the statutory duty of owners and occupiers to seek the council's approval for any activities that would damage the scientific interest. In the majority of cases, a letter of consent is issued. In the relatively few cases when agreement cannot be achieved between the council and the owner and occupier, the council will offer a management agreement and seek to negotiate compensation for loss of income as a result of the potentially damaging operation not taking place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the scientific interest of the area is of national significance, the NCC may apply to the Secretary of State for a nature conservation order. That will stop a potentially damaging operation being carried out for a period of up to 12 months to allow negotiations on a management agreement between the respective parties. If, after the end of that period, no agreement has been achieved, the owner and occupier can undertake the activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it should be apparent to the Committee that neither the notification of an SSSI nor the listing of PDOs stops the owner or occupier using his land. Notification merely establishes publicly the scientific interest in the area and places a duty on the owner and occupier to seek the consent of the NCC when a change of use is proposed. In the final analysis, the NCC cannot insist that an activity does not go ahead except by seeking the Secretary of State's authority for compulsory purchase of the site. Even then, compulsory purchase procedures are subject to a right of objection and appeal. For those reasons, we believe that clause 11 should not stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>217</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that the Minister has decided to remove the clause. The Government have made a major concession as a result of widespread pressure from outside organisations and Opposition Members. We were becoming suspicious of the Government because, instead of saying on Second Reading that they wished to remove the clause, they talked in vague terms about its not being acceptable in its present form. We thought that they would retain the principle of the clause and perhaps shift round its wording.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would have been unacceptable because, as the Minister knows, under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, there is a duty to renotifty the interested parties that were notified under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. Originally, 905 interested parties were notified under the 1949 Act, of which 774 have already been renotified and 21 are still awaiting notification. Some 254 relate to boundary extensions and 110 owners or occupiers have not been notified. Basically, the provision will repeat that practice, so it is nothing more than a wrecking clause. I am grateful to the Minister for conceding that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also described the effective appeals procedure against notification, the various mechanisms that can be used and the orders for consultation. That was an excellent and cogent argument against the new clause that deals with appeals procedure tabled by the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker). I look forward to the debate on that motion. We support the removal of the clause from the Bill, which I hope will receive the support of the entire Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief as I hope to be given the opportunity to expand my argument when I speak to my new clause. I do not wish to take up too much of the Committee's time now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept what my hon. Friend the Minister says. The clause could be seen as a wrecking clause. Because of technicalities in another place, the clause had to be framed in the way that it has been. The principle remains, however. When we debate new clause 7 hon. Members on both sides of the Committee should bear in mind that the cornerstone of our unwritten constitution is the right of hon. Members to ask questions and to have those questions answered. That principle is at issue in clause 11.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is my judgment, and I shall be interested to hear others tell me that I am wrong, that if the Bill goes through unamended, we shall have given a statutory body, a quango, the right to be its own judge and jury. Because of the built-in mechanism proposed, whereby a committee is set up within the body to review decisions with regard to appeals, hon. Members will be able to ask only that body about those decisions. We shall not be able to question a Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My judgment is based on my dealings with the Civil Aviation Authority. The situation and the principle are not dissimilar. It took me six years of persistent work in the Chamber, through early-day motions and private Member's Bills, to succeed in
	<span class='label label-info column'>218</span>
having a matter changed. The Minister said to me, as I am sure Ministers have said to other hon. Members, "I have no locus to act in this area." Parliament must be prepared to give Ministers a locus in which to act, and we as Members of Parliament must be satisfied that we can bring the Executive to account through our right to ask questions and to have them answered, so that wrongs can be redressed. Under our unwritten constitution, Parliament is the final place in the land where wrongs can be corrected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am extremely concerned, not because I want the clause to remain in the Bill, which I do not, but because the principle is fundamental to everything in which we believe. Whatever our views on the need to conserve and on other matters with which the Bill deals, I hope that there is no Member of Parliament who does not feel that he must protect his constituents' rights to go through him or her as the constituency Member to ask a Minsiter questions on fundamental and important matters which could substantially change what happens in a part of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what I want to place on record at this stage. I hope that we shall debate the matter at greater length when we reach new clause 7.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This clause had a key part in our Second Reading debate. Many of us were gravely concerned when clause 11 was inserted into the Bill in another place against the views of the Government and in a vote that the Governmemt lost. There can be no criticism of the Government's stance in another place or of their intentions since.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was particularly concerned because, as my hon. Friend the Minister has said from time to time, I was deeply involved in the Wildlife and countryside Act 1981. The hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) will well remember the crucial debates on sections 28 and 29, which established the sites of special scientific interest procedure. That has always been based on scientific evidence. In another place their Lordships endeavoured to devalue that scientific opinion by setting up an appeals system that was not based on scientific evidence. I am pleased that the Government have removed clause 11, but it is essential to view the decision as one that is scientific. I am glad that the second opinion on SSSIs will be given by the new scientific committee of the Nature Conservancy Council for Scotland and, in future, by SNH.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said on Second Reading, the key factor is not the procedures that are being changed by removing clause 11, but the new attitude of the NCCs and SNH that will result from the new regional committees. When deciding on SSSIs, I hope that those committees will meet personally with the landowners concerned or the owners of SSSIs to talk through the reasons why their properties are considered to have such important conservation qualities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The failures, of the past may have resulted from too much inflexibility insufficient personal contact at varying levels between the NCC and those who
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0126">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>219</span>
had their land classed as an SSSI. The majority probably welcomed the designation as a great asset to their estates. Others who may have had development in mind resisted to the last, the idea that their land should be classed as an SSSI. In the NCC, we were always right to stick to the scientific evaluation and not to be moved by the loss of potential development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the public relations exercise between landowners and the NCC, we listed potentially damaging operations. I agree that almost any owner faced with such a prospect may say, "Goodness me, I have no control whatever over my land," However, anyone who read the small print would accept that, in the majority of cases, the operations would be approved by the NCC and that it was purely a matter of consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have taken a significant step foward by removing clause 11. The new procedures devised by John Francis and Magnus Magnusson for appealing within the NCC to the scientific committee will go some way towards alleviating the worries of those who feel that the SSSI system is too heavy of burden to be imposed on their property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many difficulties have been due to a lack of either adequate communication or the right style of communication. If the meaning of an SSSI was fully explained and people could see what little practical impact it would have on their estates, they would know that they could continue to manage their estates in much the same way as at present. That would remove their fears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have taken the best step forward and I hope that when the Bill reaches another place, it will take the same view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, wish to record my comments. I have received a number of representations about clause 11 from my constituents. Like other hon. Members, I am delighted that it has been withdrawn. I see it as a victory for democracy. I agree with the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) that we are now enabled to voice the views expressed by our constituents and to influence what is done in this place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is true at this moment in time. The hon. Gentleman should have listened carefully to what I had to say, because we shall have to live with the consequences of the Bill when it becomes an Act. He may then find that his constituents will be unable to obtain from him scientific evidence that cannot be disputed. Scientists can hold different views and the view of one could contradict that of another, although both could be attempting to arrive at the same point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am making a point of principle in regard to our unwritten constitution. I know that clause 11 is unworkable in many ways, but the hon. Gentleman should bear in mind that we are legislating for what will happen in future. Otherwise he may have cause for regret.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>220</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should listen to what other hon. Members are saying; some may be a little fed up with what he has said in the past. We are discussing a stage-by-stage process. Clause 11 is being withdrawn, but I am talking about the public outcry at the other place imposing it. I see that as a victory for democracy and I am not anticipating the hon. Gentleman's new clause 7 because we shall discuss it at the appropriate time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letters that I have received have all shown concern about the damage that would be done to SSSIs. One comment that appeared in a Scottish newspaper stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the moment, we shouldn't hold our breath. When the Natural Heritage Bill returns to the Commons this month, it will be back to the barricades."</p></blockquote>
I congratulate the Minister and others for ensuring that we do not need to go back to the barricades.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to representations from constituents, we have received them from such agencies as the RSPB and the Scottish Wildlife Trust. It is a fact that Scottish SSSIs are among the best places for wildlife habitats in Great Britain, comprising 45 per cent of land in the entire area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the review procedures, following the passage of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, all SSSIs have been subject to a thorough review, using a revised set of strict scientific criteria. I endorse the comments of the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro) about the basis of scientific criteria. It is essential that they should be left in the hands of the professionals. The reviews have taken 10 years to date and have cost more than £10 million. More than 10 per cent of the 883 Scottish SSSIs, originally modified under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, have been denotified as a result of applying for strict scientific criteria.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are reports of 30 SSSIs awaiting renotification under the 1981 Act and of about 100 sites awaiting new modification. A further review would tie up the new SNH to another 10 years of effort at an estimated cost of £200 million to the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The voluntary bodies and constituents who have contacted me consider that any new money should be directed into new conservation that would benefit the community. I am delighted that the Minister has taken heed of that and that clause 11 has been withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There have been many representations from official bodies and nongovernmental organisations, but we have also received many letters on the issue from constituents who are genuinely concerned. I shall quote from a letter sent by Gavin and Averil Stewart because it makes an important point about scientific validity. They live in 29 Highfield Crescent, Linlithgow. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On the matter of appeal against designation, does this right not already exist under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, whereby the scientific validity may be challenged? Surely this is sufficient. If any further rights were to be granted, who would make the decisions? It would seem that the opportunity for making any objective statement about a Site's worth and setting it in a national context would be entirely lost—a Site's future would be liable to be prey to local political whim and pressure for development."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0127">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>221</span>
That, in my opinion, is part of the nub of the issue. The letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In short, if the Bill goes down this road to enactment, then all the efforts and achievements of the NCC staff in Scotland over the last ten years will have been for nothing—and nature conservation in Scotland will suffer a major and irretrievable catastrophe."</p></blockquote>
Such is the reaction to what happened in the other place. I am glad that the Government have taken a firm line and I hope that their Lordships will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) asked what procedures will be followed. On the Table before the Committee are the NCCS's proposed procedures for dealing with objections to SSSI notifications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) was not supporting clause 11, but was putting down a marker for his new clause 7. I shall not go into detail, other than to say that in some cases, planning decisions are delegated to reporters. Although they are decided in his name, the Secretary of State does not have an influence, in such cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the final analysis, I understand that even under old planning legislation, including delegated legislation, the Secretary of State can overrule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, not with delegated legislation, unless the reporter exceeded his powers or acted ultra vires. The strict procedures that must be followed are governed by statute. What Parliament decides must be followed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>222</span>
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro), who has played a considerable role in the NCC over the years. He said that it was right for the NCC to stick to the scientific evaluation and that the small print was not quite so imposing once it was seen in detail. SSSIs are the cornerstone of habitat protection in Scotland and throughout Britain. We intend that to continue. Statutory procedures and the new non-statutory procedures will ensure a more sensitive approach to site investigations. The regional board will have a key role, but the newly constituted science research and development board, comprising eminent scientists, will be able to give independent advice on the scientific justification for SSSIs. The science research and development board will constitute a non-statutory appeal body, which will advise SNH.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the support for the steps that we have taken that was expressed by the hon. Members for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) and for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
