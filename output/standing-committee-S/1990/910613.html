Companies (Fees) Regulations 1991</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Corporate Affairs (Mr. John Redwood)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Companies (Fees) Regulations 1991.</p></blockquote>
The proposals outlined in the regulations comprise a suggested increase in the annual return fee from£25 to£32; an increase in the search fee from£2.75 to£3; no change in the incorporation fee of£50, which was first set in 1973; and an increase in the change of name fee from£40 to£50 to bring it in line with the incorporation fee.<br><br>
Since Companies house became an executive agency, there has been a dramatic improvement in the quality of service. Searches are done on time, and 99.6 per cent of them now hit the target. There has been a sharp improvement in performance in processing incoming documents; it used to take 25 days, but they are now handled in five days. That is a big improvement for the clients of Companies house, who have access to more timely information. The volume of customer complaints is well down as a result of the great efforts made to improve the quality of service.<br><br>
The annual return fee increase compares with an annual return fee set at£20 in the days of the Labour Administration in 1975. Were that figure increased in line with inflation, it would be about£80 in today's money. Therefore, the£32 that we are proposing is quite modest compared with the position in the 1970s. The fee is also much lower than that charged by many overseas registries; one of the worst is the Italian registry, where the fee is in excess of£1,600. The search fee must be set to cover costs—no more and no less—and that is why we are proposing an increase from£2.75 to£3.<br><br>
There has been an important improvement in productivity and a reduction in overall unit costs at Companies house, but the cost of searches is affected by fewer searches being made recently, compared with our forecasts, and also because at the moment it is the most labour-intensive part of the organisation. Therefore, we must pass on the costs that we incur in handling those search requests. For a search, people have access to a registry containing the records of more than 1 million live companies.<br><br>
For the£3 that we are proposing, the average experience is to receive six microfiches with 360 pages of information, comprising annual returns, company accounts and other statutory information. We believe that that represents good value for clients' money.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
There are also proposals in the regulations affecting postal search charges, and I am pleased to report that the postal and fax services that Companies house has launched are popular and are providing good benefits to customers. I am sure that the Committee welcomes the fact that there is no proposed increase in charges for services through the on-line system. If you will permit me, Mr. Lamond, I shall try to respond to any points that members of the Committee might like to raise.</span></p>
<p>10.33 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Majorie Mowlam <span class='memberconstituency'>(Redcar)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister has outlined, the changes are in line with the executive agency status of Companies house. As we have said in relation to other statutory instruments relating to Companies house, the Opposition are concerned to ensure that information is available for journalists, shareholders and other interested parties at a cost that they can afford. Just as a librarian is to defend and protect the books against the reader, we want to ensure that Companies house is a source of information and does not make it difficult for individuals to obtain necessary information.<br><br>
I have only a couple of questions for the Minister. First, I have been able to find the figures for income costs and net expenditure only for 1989–90. I could not find the figures for 1990–91 in the public domain, although that might be my failing. Can those figures be made available? They would help to evaluate the Minister's point about the quality of service and the cost effectiveness of Companies house under its new status.<br><br>
As the Minister outlined, almost all Companies house fees are due to rise—many to well above inflation. The registration fee for annual reports will rise by nearly 30 per cent. and search fees by 10 per cent. How does the Minister square that with the fact that executive agency status was supposed to encourage greater efficiency? In particular, how does the Minister square those price rises with the objective agreed by the chief executive with Ministers from the Department of Trade and Industry to reduce real costs by 1 per cent. in the year 1991–92, as stated in the Companies house press release on 9 May 1991? Page 2, paragraph 4 states that one of the targets was
<br><blockquote><p>"To reduce real unit costs by 1 per cent. in 1991/92."</p></blockquote>
It would be useful if the Minister would provide statistics for that year so that we could see whether that target had been reached.<br><br>
It is important to keep search fees low. The Government are keen to increase share ownership and have made several efforts in that direction. Many of those efforts have been unsuccessful. Over three years,£250,000 has been put towards a newly-formed wider share ownership council whose objective will be to widen share ownership. If that is to be achieved, investors must have access to the information that they need. That is especially important because, as the Minister is aware, we are suffering more bankruptcies than ever before. This month it was reported in <i>The Times</i>that company liquidations have soared to the highest level for 20 years. Against that background, investors must be able to obtain the necessary information about
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0417">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
companies at a cost that is not exorbitant, otherwise that information will be beyond their reach.<br><br>
The Polly Peck experience is a good example. For several years, many people talked about Polly Peck and its problems, but the information did not get through to the public domain. Similarly, Lonrho exposed the fragility of the bond corporation using information that was in the public domain, but it required all of Lonrho's resources and staff to do that. Such information should be available to as many people as possible.<br><br>
The Minister mentioned the Italian annual return fee, which is under investigation because it is so high that it constitutes a capital tax. That must be considered in its European context. In EC directive 1968/151–that is the latest relevant one that I can find—article 3, paragraph 3 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Copies of the records of limited companies held in each country's register should be available at a price not exceeding administrative cost including postal charge".</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister confirm that that is the case in the United Kingdom?</span></p>
<p>10.38 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Shaw <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dover)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The charges for services offered by Companies House are exceedingly reasonable and have improved considerably in recent years. On behalf of small busineses, I should like to make the point that, at the moment, small and large companies pay the same rate. Now that there is a plc status and a limited company status, company law is sufficiently flexible to permit large and small companies to be charged at different rates, which would avoid a heading company which is a plc paying a lower rate than the other companies in its group. Some benefit could be given to smaller companies in that way.<br><br>
When my hon. Friend reviews the efficiency of executive agencies, he should bear in mind that Companies house is a monopoly and that it will continue to be one. One must recognise that the free market is not operating in that respect and there is not necessarily competition. One must therefore exercise extra caution when examining the justification for fee increases.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alex Carlile <span class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomery)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As a Member for a Welsh constituency, I pay tribute to the increased efficiency of Companies house, which operates in Wales and whose Welsh employees work assiduously and efficiently.<br><br>
As a practising lawyer who takes a special interest in the civil and criminal aspects of commercial fraud, I can affirm that the quick response from Companies house makes it much easier for the police and others to detect the fraudulent setting up of companies. That leads me to a concern of many people in legal practice. It is still possible for people wanting to commit fraud to buy reputable papers, such as<i>Exchange and Mart,</i>and, within hours, to acquire a company for£99 and mailing lists that contain thousands of names for£20 or£30. They can then set up a fraudulent business within a couple of days, collect large sums of money by mailing unsuspecting members of the public within a couple of weeks and then disappear without trace with their ill-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
gotten gains. There have been many such cases. It is still far too easy for limited companies to be here today and gone tomorrow.<br><br>
One way of dealing with that problem may be to increase further the fees for people who start up small companies and who do not have any apparent reason for doing so. Will the Minister accept that problems of fraud arise because it is still all too easy to acquire limited company status? Will he assure the committee that, although raising the fees further may not be the appropriate vehicle for dealing with the problem, the department of Trade and Industry has the matter under close consideration, and that the exclusion of fraud is a priority for the Government? I repeat my well-deserved tribute to Companies house. I have no quarrel with the proposed increase of fees.</span></p>
<p>10.39 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Carlile) for his praise of the performance of Companies house. I share his view that people in south Wales and in London have done a marvellous job of improving the service. They take great pride in what they are achieving, and customers and clients are benefiting from that.<br><br>
I defend the proposition that we should respond quickly to people who seek to form a company. Most companies are formed for legitimate reasons and it is part of a successful enterprise economy that people should be able to take advantage of limited liability status.<br><br>
Such people should not have penal taxes or delays imposed on them because the activities of a small minority are fraudulent. The eradication of fraud, in exactly the way that the hon. and learned Gentleman seeks, is a high priority for the government. We have taken several measures to ensure that that is done.<br><br>
The most important measure is to make full use of the power to disqualify people from being directors of companies when it has been established that they have operated faudulently in the past. We shall soon have disqualified more than 1,000 people by court orders, as a result of prosecutions brought under that power. We are trying to ensure that such people do not recommit fraud. It is important to clamp down on those offences. I assure the Committee that we shall take every reasonable action to detect fraud and to bring prosecutions.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Dover (Mr. Shaw) also gave his welcome support to the reasonableness of some of the proposed fees and to the achievement of Companies house in improving its performance. I am aware that some of those fees are charges for monopoly services or for statutory requirements. For that reason, I assure him that I pay special attention to what happens to costs and to the efficiency of service delivery. I and the House act as watchdog for the public, ensuring that those statutory impositions are kept to the minimum necessary to do a good job. I hope that when my hon. Friend sees the next annual report, he will see more of the fruits of those labours. Certainly, the report that we filed for 1989–90 shows the extent to which Companies house had made great progress in improving labour productivity and in lowering unit costs.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0418">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
The hon. Member for Redcar (Mr. Mowlam) rightly stressed that company information should be available—that is the whole purpose of the system. We share that interest in ensuring that all those with limited liability privileges should make timely disclosures of information to users of company accounts who wish to get information from Companies house. We take that duty seriously, so there is a big compliance effort under way every working day at Companies house to chase the directors and secretaries of companies which have failed to fulfill their obligations to lodge the right documentation.<br><br>
We send letters and reminders, and we prosecute a number of cases to act as a more serious reminder both to those whom we are prosecuting and to the company sector generally that there is an important duty on all those charged with responsibility for limited liability companies. Last year we prosecuted 1,300 people in connection with failure to supply documents when they should have done so. We are also examining the introduction of an intermediate civil penalty for the late filing of accounts as an additional back-up to the existing criminal sanction. The system is useful only if companies comply.<br><br>
Some years ago, compliance fell as low as 40 per cent., which meant that the system was of little utility to the general public. Compliance is now around the 80 per cent. mark. However, we still do not think that that is adequate, and we are setting more ambitious targets for future years because many companies are still not filing. We wish to see everyone meeting their obligations or winding up their companies when they are no longer trading.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Redcar asked why, if efficiency is improving, two of the fees have risen by more than the rate of inflation. She must examine the whole package of fees because some have not increased. Also, the reason for the more substantial increase in the annual return fee—that is, from £25 to£32—is that the fee also covers the costs of investigations and elements of the company law system. The main increase in costs that have required the increase in fee have fallen in that area, and not in Company house's operating expenses, which have been under much better control.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Redcar might ask why there has been an increase in investigation costs. It is a conjunction of circumstances. First, in recent years rather more investigations have been carried out—something that she would welcome, as she wishes to see the Department pursuing malpractice or potential wrongdoing with all due diligence. Secondly, Parliamentary has urged us to bring forward the results of inquiries more rapidly. We are trying to do so, and that produces a bunching of work and cost as we try to catch up with the backlog and, at the same time, handle new work in a timely way.<br><br>
For those conjoint reasons, there has been a surge in the cost of investigations, which is reflected in the fee we have set for the annual return. We also had to cover the additional costs of the Financial Reporting Council. It was always accepted in the Dearing report and by the House that those costs should be covered out of levies on companies.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
As for the search fee, I sketched in my introduction that it had risen because it is the labour-intensive part of the activity and has not yet benefited so much from the improvements seen elsewhere in the service. However, technology will be introduced later to help improve searches. We have also experienced a decline compared with our forecasts for the number of searches that were going to be made. Therefore, the overheads have had to be proportionately higher. The increase is below 10 per cent. I never like recommending increases, as I would far rather cover costs through productivity, but that is not always possible.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Redcar referred to efficiency and to our report on the year 1990–91. We do not yet have the audited figures for that year, but the report should be published in July. In the two years to April 1991 there have been good improvements overall in labour productivity. There was a good improvement in real unit costs, which we published in 1989–90, but the result for the most recent year was not so good.<br><br>
However, we have still to complete our figures for 1990–91, and when we do so we shall inform the House in the usual way. We always set clear targets for ensuing years, and we expect to see continuing pressure to lower unit costs, as well as to improve labour productivity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Mowlam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I accept that the annual report will not be published until July, but it would assist the work of the Committee if Members could see the unaudited figures in some shape or form, so that we could compare them with the figures for 1989–90. That would help the Committee to evaluate the Minister's proposals.<br><br>
Secondly the Minister said that there had been more than 1,000 cases of disqualification under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986. Do those figures apply to the period since the instigation of that Act?<br><br>
Thirdly, will the Minister expand on the options for an intermediary civil penalty, to deal with the failure of companies to register?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To reply to the hon. Lady's second point about the disqualification of directors, the figures apply to the period since the power was introduced. We have not yet reached 1,000, but I think that we are close to it and I shall announce it when we do, as I am sure that the hon. Lady would like to know when that rather grisly historic landmark has been reached.<br><br>
As to the hon. Lady's third point, it would be possible to introduce a civil penalty for the late filing of accounts, which would take the form of an additional charge on those who failed to comply with the statutory requirements. That would be in lieu of a criminal prosecution. If a company made reasonable progress in filing accounts it would be charged the additional fee when it finally filed them. That would act as an incentive to companies that were just a little lazy and which did not have serious intent not to file returns.<br><br>
On the hon. Lady's first point, I cannot produce more information than I already have. I have told the Committee that there was a good increase in labour
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0419">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
productivity in both the years that the hon. Lady mentioned. I have told her the figure for real unit costs, which rose by 5 per cent in the year for which they were published and which rose a little more in the following year. I cannot give any more information until the audited figures are published.</span></p>
