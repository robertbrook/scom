	<div class='legislation'>CIVIL LEGAL AID (ASSESSMENT OF RESOURCES) (AMENDMENT) REGULATIONS 1991</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Fraser 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Norwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Civil Legal Aid (Assessment of Resources) (Amendment) Regulations 1991.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the agreement of the Committee, it will be convenient to discuss at the same time the Legal Advice and Assistance (Amendment) Regulations 1991 and the Legal Aid in Criminal and Care Proceedings (General) (Amendment) Regulations 1991.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make it clear that the Opposition wanted to debate the three regulations on the Floor of the House and the Government denied us that opportunity, for reasons that I understand. There is pressure of business on the Floor of the House. Had we had that opportunity, we would have voted against the regulations, which are regressive, mean and representative of a further increase in the intensity with which the Government are besieging the legal aid system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations raise the floor below which a person who needs civil representation, advice or a criminal defence need not pay anything. The minimum disposable income above which one must contribute will be raised to £55 a week. Disposable income is what is left after payment of travelto-work expenses and certain housing expenses; if it is less than £55, the person will henceforth not have to make any contribution. For eligibility for legal advice—generally called the green form system—the minimum income is raised to £70 a week, and for criminal legal aid to about £65 a week. Below those figures, no contribution is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those provisions are bad enough, because the figures do not follow the rise in average earnings. However, perhaps the greatest objection to the regulations is that they do not raise the upper limits of income or capital and consequently many people will be outside the scope of the legal aid system. The upper limit for civil legal aid remains £122 of disposable income a week. No legal aid is available above that limit except in personal injuries cases, where the upper limit is £134 a week. I shall not go into the details of the advice and criminal legal aid limits, as the figures are broadly similar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations do not raise the capital limits; the present limit is £8,000, above which there is no eligibility for legal aid. In the past, it has generally been the practice to update the limits yearly, broadly in line with the increases in limits applied for the purposes of social security payments. The increase in the lower levels is less than the rise in wage levels. Because the increase follows the social security index rather than wages index, proportionately more people will have to
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
pay for advice and assistance. The 1990 increase was less than both the wages index and the retail prices index and therefore even the lower limit represents a further substantial application of pressure on the legal aid system. The Opposition calculate that the absence of revised upper limits will leave about 1.1 million people beyond the scope of legal aid. For those reasons, the regulations are vindictive and mean. They put greatest pressure on the people from whom the Government should canvass support. Those are people who go out to work and who have a moderate income and moderate savings. They are the people to whom the regulations will be vindictively applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because there has been no review of the upper limits, the capital limit for eligibility for legal advice under the scheme remains at £800. If someone saves more than £800 but has a low income, it will be impossible for him or her to obtain any advice or assistance under what is known as the green form scheme. If the capital limit had been raised even in line with inflation, it would be at least £250 higher. The failure to increase the limit is a real and painful suppression of the right to advice. The suppression of the ability to obtain advice is the suppression of people's rights, because rights are useless without access to the advice and assistance that is necessary to enforce them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In April 1989, the single person's upper limit of disposable income beyond which civil legal aid was not available was below £120. If it were linked to the retail prices index, that upper limit would be raised today to £193, but the regulations do nothing to raise the limit. To keep roughly the same percentage of the population within the scope of the legal aid scheme we must consider the earnings index. That index suggests that the upper limit for single persons for civil representation and advice should be raised to £234, but it is only £122. That is a savage and cynical reduction of people's ability to assert their rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was reckoned that between 1979 and 1989 about 5.5 million households—about 14 million people—lost the right to legal aid. In 1991, the number of people disqualified from the legal aid scheme will be even greater and it has been authoritatively recalculated that about 37 per cent. of the population will now be eligible for legal aid as a result of the regulations and the failure to update limits. When the Labour party introduced the legal aid scheme in 1948, about 90 per cent. of the population were eligible for civil legal aid—at that time, there was criminal legal aid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General (Sir Nicholas Lyell)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman is quoting figures produced by Mr. Murphy which have been examined and printed by the Law Society. Those figures are not necessarily accepted. The matter has been debated at length. The figures drawn from the family expenditure survey, particularly those in the table on page 85 of the consultation document, show that in 1990 household and population eligibility was between 60 per cent. and 69 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am at a disadvantage. I received the document only because, five or 10 minutes ago, I was lent a copy by someone from the Law Society. I have not had the advantage as a Member of Parliament of obtaining the document from the Vote Office. It is disgraceful that we are debating an important issue involving the civil rights of millions of people, yet the Lord Chancellor's document is not available to members of the public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0284">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dave Nellist 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Coventry, South-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I went to the Vote Office last night and asked for the document. I was told that no copies had been deposited at the Vote Office. I then went to the Library. Admittedly, I did so at the start of the Adjournment debate and there was not much time. The Library was unable to provide me with a copy. I went to the Vote Office again this morning at 9.20 am and I was again unable to obtain a copy. I obtained the telephone number of the Lord Chancellor's office and rang that number at 9.25 am. Perhaps it was a little early, but I could not obtain an answer. I have been unable to obtain the doucment, which the press have had since yesterday. There is much comment on the document in the newspapers. The Minister has quoted statistics from it and Opposition members of the Committee should have a copy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Pendry 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stalybridge and Hyde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg. I, too, have scurried around trying to find a copy of the document. I respectfully suggest that it is within your power to suspend the sitting in order for us to obtain the basic information necessary to debate the matter properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a difficult matter for me. I understand the difficulties that are encountered when documents are not readily available to hon. Members. The fact that the document is now available means that the sitting can continue. However, I am sympathetic to the point that has been raised and it would be in the Committee's interest if I suspended the sitting for 10 minutes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to members of the Committee. Documents were available yesterday at the consultation meeting held by the Lord Chancellor. I could not get a copy myself from the Vote Office last night. Although a suspension of the sitting is entirely a matter for you, Mr. Hogg, we are dealing with broad figures that I have debated many times with the hon. Member for Norwood (Mr. Fraser). We are not today crawling over the precise details of the tables. Even if we rose for 10 minutes, we would not be able to do that. I suggest that it is better to continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Maclennan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caithness and Sutherland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Hogg. The Committee is indebted to you for your suggestion. The Minister told us that the consultation process began yesterday. This sitting is the first opportunity that hon. Members will have had to voice their views as part of that consultation process. To continue with the debate without members of the Committee having had a proper opportunity to consider whether the Minister's remarks are sustained by the document would be wrong. The suggestion to suspend the sitting is sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. In the circumstances and notwithstanding the comments made by the Solicitor-General, I shall suspend the sitting for 10 minutes only. I think that that will meet the point that hon. Member's have made. I suspend the sitting until 5 minutes to 11 o'clock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.43 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended.</i></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
	<p>10.55 am</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends have had two minutes to consider a document with 151 pages. The Opposition's view is that the Committee should be adjourned. I should like to move, That further consideration of the regulations be now adjourned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document is of considerable importance because the Lord Chancellor's office cited its existence as the reason for freezing the upper limits of capital and income. We have not had a chance to study the document adequately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not prepared to accept such a motion. The 10 minute suspension was as much as I was prepared to allow. The document to which the hon. Member for Norwood (Mr. Fraser) referred is a reference document, not one that is being considered by the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nellist</div> <!-- member --> 	<div class='membercontribution'>	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Member resumes his seat, we shall debate the regulations before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nellist</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I do not wish overtly to challenge your ruling, but it should be recorded that Conservative Members have had access to the document, which contains a large amount of statistical information. The Solicitor-General has already found instantly the page in the document containing the information that he needed to rebut a remark made by my hon. Friend the Member for Norwood (Mr. Fraser)—who was quoting a very senior mathematician from the London School of Economics. I should not have known which page of the document to consult as the Minister did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More importantly, the document contains the background to the regulations that we are debating today. I should have liked the opportunity to study the document in order to debate on a par with Conservative Members this morning. It should be recorded that Opposition Members are at a severe disadvantage because we did not receive the document until a few minutes ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has not raised a point of order on which I can rule. His observations will appear in the 	<i>Official Report.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg. I hope to persuade you to change your mind because you are an eminently sensible and respected hon. Member. When you suspended the Committee for 10 minutes, I am sure that you thought that Opposition Members would have the document in their hands almost immediately and not just two minutes before we resumed. It must be clear to you, Mr. Hogg, if not to Conservative Members, that Opposition Members cannot possibly understand the points made by the Solicitor-General. The right hon. and learned Gentleman talked of a cosy relationship with my colleague the hon. Member for Norwood (Mr. Fraser)—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I meant that the Solicitor-General said that he had debated the figures many times in the past with my hon. Friend. Some of us have not debated the figures before. As a humble Back Bencher, I should have wished
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0285">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
more time to get to grips with the problems. The Solicitor-General referred to the document as part of his case. I hope that you will agree, Mr. Hogg, that Opposition Members cannot do justice to the serious problems that we are debating unless we have more time to consider the document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is well known for his reasonableness in such matters. His comments always weigh heavily with me on such occasions. However, I repeat that the document is for reference and is not being considered today. Therefore, the status of the document does not permit me to accept an Adjournment motion. Alas, I am not persuaded by the hon. Member's eloquence. Perhaps the hon. Member for Norwood will now continue his speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hogg. The Opposition accept your ruling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was saying before I was interrupted by the Solicitor-General some time ago that we were witnessing a savage and cynical reduction in people's ability to enforce their rights. I gave figures that showed that between 1979 and 1989, 5.5 million households, or 14 million individuals, lost their eligibility for legal aid. Those figures are important, because calculations that I have seen, not just by the Law Society, but also by others, suggest that if households are taken out of the figures of eligibility for legal aid, the percentage of the population that emerges is greater than the percentage of households.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred us to the tables on page 85, which I have only just seen. I can say only two things about them. First, we had no chance to examine the figures and there is a major difference of opinion about the calculation of the number that have been removed from eligibility. Secondly, the table itself states that it refers to eligibility on income grounds alone. When one takes into account disqualification from legal aid on the ground of capital, the effect is very different. The problem is exactly the same as that of disqualifcation from poll tax rebate; if the capital that people have saved is taken into account, the figures for disqualification from a poll tax rebate or from legal aid look very different. However, we shall have to re-examine the figures; we cannot come to a settled view today. Clearly, however one looks at it, eligibility for legal aid is increasingly being reduced. The regulations make that area of eligibility smaller than it has ever been in the past few years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that the Lord Chancellor's document, to which the Solicitor-General referred, talks about people's propensity to assert their legal rights when they do not have to contribute to the legal costs. I wonder whether there will be cross-fertilisation of that idea and whether the Government will say in future that people have a greater tendency to go into hospital to have operations if they do not have to pay for them—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nellist</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or if they are ill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, exactly. It is a very odd philosophy that says that the extent to which one can assert one's legal rights depends on how much one contributes to the cost of the proceedings. The matter is determined not on its merits, but on how much it costs. If that principle were adopted for the health service—we do not know what is coming, so
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
perhaps this is a pointer to the future—we could be told that people might claim that they were ill and take up hospital beds, simply because they would not have to contribute to the costs. That is a vile way of looking at people's rights to health or to legal assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whenever the lower limit reflects inflation and not earnings, more people are driven to contribute and more people are driven out of eligibility. Whenever the upper limits, whether of capital or of income, fail to reflect the rise in average earnings, or as in the regulations, fail to be increased at all, more people are driven out of eligibility for legal aid. Whenever both limits are lower that the rate of inflation—and recently they have been—more people are driven out of the scope of legal assistance. More people then ever before are being driven out by the regulations' failure to increase the upper limits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tabled a parliamentary question to the Attorney-General on that matter, to discover whether the Government had introduced a new policy of freezing the upper limits. The Attorney-General replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is not the Lord Chancellor's policy to freeze the upper limits of capital and income for legal aid eligibility. The Lord Chancellor is conducting a full review of the financial conditions for legal aid. The first stage of the review, covering civil, non-matrimonial legal aid is nearing completion. A consultation paper will be issued".—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 28th March 1991; Vol. 188, c. 483.]</p></blockquote>
That consultation paper came out yesterday and was given to Opposition Members a few minutes ago. What one divines from that parliamentary answer, and from a debate on Scots regulations, which are almost identical in their content, is that the freezing of the upper limit is connected with the Lord Chancellor's consultations and review document. That is pretty cynical. It is almost deceitful to say that fewer people will be eligible for legal aid because there is a consultation document that gives them absolutely nothing. That is an odd way to deal with matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are greadually moving towards a first-class legal service that is available only to companies, to the state, to people who have adequate resources and to those whose legal costs are tax deductible an who receive a VAT input from them. A first-class legal service will be available to those who can afford to pay for it. There will also be a second-class legal service—very often the present legal aid service—because, if one looks at the rates of remuneration for legal aid work and at the constraints imposed upon it, one can see that it is a second-class service. There will be people who fall between those two categories, who do not qualify for legal aid, but who are not rich enough to take proceedings without financial assistance. For those who fall in the middle there may be no service whatever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that is against a background of crippling cuts in funding to advice services and law centres. It is not as if the shortcomings in the legal aid scheme are being made up elsewhere. We know that, as a result of poll tax capping, advice centres and law centres are closing in many boroughs throughout the United Kingdom. All that the Government offer as an excuse for freezing the upper limit—and that is the Opposition's greatest objection to the regulations—is a bran tub of gimmicks in the form of the consultation document. The central issue of that document is the safety net proposals under which people may have to use their life savings to start legal proceedings before they know whether they will receive legal aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations constitute the most frightful and cynical attack on the legal aid scheme that I have seen during my time on the Front Bench. the Opposition wanted the

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
regulations to be debated on the Floor of the House and, if we had the opportunity to vote, we should certainly have voted against them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before calling the Solicitor-General, I should say that, on the question of injury time, which has been raised with me informally, Standing Order No. 101 requires me to put the Question
	<br><blockquote><p>"when the Committee shall have sat for one-and-a-half hours".</p></blockquote>
When there is an informal suspension the Committee is still technically sitting, by analogy with the House, where, when there is a suspension, the Mace remains on the Table. There is therefore, no injury time and that was something that I had to balance against the convenience of the Committee when I allowed the informal suspension to take place. I hope that that clarifies the position so that everybody knows that we shall finish at 12 o'clock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.8 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Hogg. The hon. Member for Norwood (Mr. Fraser) and I frequently have short but constructive debates in Committee and that does not mean that we should not address ourselves to matters of controversy. However, it is worth remembering what the facts are when he attacks the Government for spending too little on legal aid as he seeks to do this morning. The facts are that, under the Conservatives, legal aid has been almost the fastestgrowing—indeed it might be the fastest-growing—area of Government expenditure. It has risen in broad terms, from about £99 million in 1978–79, the last year of the previous Labour Government, to over £866 million gross and £697 million net in 1991.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Mullin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sunderland, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One possible explanation for the figures quoted by the Solicitor-General is that many more people are using legal aid, but another is the bizarre increase in legal fees at the same time. Those of us who have recent association with cases involving our finest legal minds have noticed the scale of fees charged for what is often only a few weeks' work. Should that factor be reviewed, instead of attempting to exclude more people from the legal aid system?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. If he can be patient, he will find that I shall deal with that point in the body of my speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point that I wish to make is that the Labour party's position is not clear. The hon. Member for Norwood mentioned uprating according to earning indices rather than according to the retail prices index. I do not know whether that is part of Labour party policy, but the party's most recent statement on legal aid said that 13 million men and women had been deprived of eligibility. The statement continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Over time and as resources become available, we intend consistently to improve access to legal aid."</p></blockquote>
I am not sure whether that commitment is a priority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third point is that we need constructive proposals to make legal aid more fairly and widely available at an affordable cost. I hope to find common ground on the issue at the heart of the Government's consultation paper, which was published yesterday. I have apologised to the Committee that we have not had long to read that paper. I am sure that we shall have an opportunity to do so in the future. The Lord Chancellor is extremely concerned, as I
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
am and as I hope are all members of the Committee, that legal aid should be directed to those who need it. That is why the Lord Chancellor is conducting a full review of the financial conditions for the granting of legal aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members know, a consultation paper covering non-matrimonial civil legal aid was issued yesterday. There was much press comment on it this morning. That document puts forward several options for better delivery of legal aid to those who need it, without confining it—as it has been confined for the past 42 years—only to those on low or modest levels of income within the much criticised eligibility limits. That would be the virtue of what the Lord Chancellor described in the consultation document as the safety net approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the safety net approach, litigants who are not eligible for immediate civil legal aid—the Committee should remember that 80 per cent. of those who obtain civil legal aid pay no contributions at all, so it is in that sense entirely free—will be able to qualify for legal aid by beginning their cases on a private basis and spending their own money up to an individually assessed spending limit. Subject to a merits test, those people would become eligible for legal aid. If a scheme can be introduced on that basis, it may overcome one of the principal conceptual criticisms of the whole system, which is that litigation is available only to the very rich or those of very limited means. The scheme would extend the possibility of legal aid to those who are now ineligible, but who have meritorious cases that they cannot litigate because of the high cost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nellist</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I am sorry to interrupt the flow of the Minister's speech, which is extremely interesting, but he is concentrating on the consultation document that we received only a few moments ago. He is talking about changes to the legal aid system that are not contained in the regulations. I should be quite happy to debate those changes if I had had time to read the document. We should either debate the regulations or have a wider debate, which I should love, after we have had more time than we have been given this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg. You advised us that the document before us is a background document to the discussion of the regulations. The Minister has addressed the bulk of his remarks not to the regulations, but to the background document. The Committee is in a dilemma. Either the Minister has the advantage of deploying extensive arguments on a paper that the Committee has not had a chance to assimilate, or the entire Committee should be given the opportunity to do so. In that case, the Committee should be adjourned. We should not have an unbalanced debate because that is a denial of the democratic process. I ask you Mr. Hogg, to give us the protection that is available to you.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point made by the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan) disturbs me, as did the point of order raised by the hon. Member for Coventry, South-East (Mr. Nellist). I suggest to the Solicitor-General that the thrust of his argument should be founded on the regulations. I am sure that he will bear in mind the observations that have been made. At this time, I cannot alter the ruling that I gave earlier. The document is a background document and I am sure that members of the Committee, including the Solicitor-General, will bear that in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0287">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, Mr. Hogg. It is a difficult point because legal aid is almost always discussed in broad terms. Eligibility upratings are usually considered in the context of the whole picture. Naturally, when the Lord Chancellor takes the initiative of publishing a consultation document, the House is interested in it and it is relevant to the uprating. The annual uprating can be debated by itself, but it cannot be debated in a complete vacuum. I shall do my best, but I wish to help and inform the public debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to this year's uprating, it has been the practice to increase legal aid eligibility limits in April each year, in line with the uprating of income-related social security benefits—that is, the RPI exclusive of housing costs. Housing costs are allowed separately in calculating an individual's disposable income. However, this year, only the free income limit has been raised, by 8.1 per cent. The upper limit for eligibility remains the same. The purpose of uprating the lower or free income limit, while we consider a new system for those at the upper end of the eligibility band, was to continue to protect the most needy—those eligible for free legal aid—pending the outcome of the first stage of the review of the financial conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way in which people pay for legal aid should be put in the context of the wider debate. Unless litigants are among the 80 per cent. who receive legal aid absolutely free, they pay a contribution. The contribution paid depends on their income within the span of the eligibility limit, from the point where a tiny contribution is paid, just above the free level, to the point where the maximum contribution is paid. The maximum contribution, for those just within the income limits, can run to many hundred pounds or even to a few thouand pounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two factors behind the Lord Chancellor's thinking on the uprating for this year. First, we need to address the rapidly escalating costs of legal aid. I shall come to the point about the cost of litigation that was sensibly raised by the hon. Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin). The second point is how we should deploy the moneys that the legally aided litigant who pays a contribution has to pay out in one form or another. The Lord Chancellor has put foward for consultation the suggestion that there might be merit in introducing a system that would do away with upper eligibility levels for those paying the higher level of contribution. If one was undertaking an expensive legal case—some can get very expensive—one would first pay out what one could reasonably afford, then the legal aid system would come in, provided that one's case could be shown still to have merit, to pay for the rest of the case. That point is worth considering in the context of eligibility uprating.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. The Solicitor-General is clearly going right to the heart of the issue that is dealt with in the consultation document and he is not addressing the matters contained in the regulations. The Committee is being put at a disadvantage by that; it is not open to Opposition Members to deploy arguments about the document, in response to what the Solicitor-General has said, even if you were to permit the debate to be extremely wide, which I am sure that you have no mind to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already ruled several times on the document and I have permitted the debate to widen. The question that the hon. Member for Sunderland, South (Mr.
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
Mullin) asked widened the scope of discussion somewhat. Notwithstanding that, I thought that it was in the Committee's interests to permit that question and to permit the answer to it. That is what I understand to be happening. I am not of a mind to give advice different from that which I have previously given. I hope that we can now proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Hogg, and I support your ruling. We are, after all, talking about legal aid eligibility limits and what the litigant who has legal aid must pay. That necessarily involves the circumstances in which he or she pays, including the fact that limits have not been uprated in line with inflation this year as in previous years. Consequently the pros and cons of that policy are relevant. You are entirely right, Mr. Hogg, to rule that that widened debate is wholly in order. I am surprised that the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan seeks to fetter the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall illustrate that point in answer to the question of the hon. Member of Sunderland, South. He asked why legal aid costs had gone up so rapidly. Civil legal aid costs, in particular, have more than doubled in the past five years. The average cost of civil litigation has increased by about 61 per cent. over the past five years, while the retail prices index has increased by 32 per cent. over that period. One has to answer the question that the hon. Gentleman posed in general terms: why have legal costs, whether fees or money spent on experts or on cases that last longer than expected, gone up so much faster than the retail prices index? The Lord Chancellor invites us to consider, as background to the policy of pulling in the reins on the upper end of legal aid eligibility, whether those costs are justified and whether the present legal aid system is the best possible method of giving public help for litigation. He keeps an open mind on that question. He has published a consultation paper, as we all now know, which we shall doubtless have a much fuller opportunity to debate in future, when all Members of the Committee—including me—have been able to study its details and argument in greater depth. The hon. Member for Sunderland, South asked a good question about whether the increase in costs, to an average of arond £1,500 per legal aid case, was justified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mullin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Might not one starting point be to publish some of the fees that the legal aid system pays to barristers who work on some of the more celebrated cases? Once the public know of those outrageous fees some pressure may be brought to bear on barristers—it is largely barristers who are involved—about them. How much was Mr. Graham Boal paid for his outrageous performance of the last Birmingham appeal? That information would shock the public, and perhaps Members of Parliament, into action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sad that the hon. Gentleman, whom I respect, should weaken and lower his case by attacking Mr. Graham Boal, the senior Treasury counsel. Whether or not his case met with the hon. Gentleman's approval, he deployed it properly in open court—in my view, skilfully and scrupulously. It is inappropriate to make such a personal attack.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mullin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was there and the right hon. and learned Gentleman was not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order, I do not think that we should pursue that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0288">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are right, Mr. Hogg. I regret that the matter was raised in that way. That was a criminal case and we are discussing civil legal aid. We are considering not individual fees but the cost to the litigant, of which fees are a part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The unit cost of civil legal aid cases is increasing dramatically. In 1989–90, the average civil legal aid bill was over £1,500—some 61 per cent. higher than the average in 1985–86. That is a rate of increase of nearly twice the rate of inflation. The cost of living increased in the same period by 32 per cent. A primary responsibility for improving efficiency must rest with us as lawyers. The legal profession cannot expect either the private client or the taxpayer to make up the difference between what the profession wants to charge and what litigants can pay. If the system is to work, we as lawyers must offer the service that is needed at an affordable price.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, although there are uncertainties in litigation, I reject the criticisms that have been made of the safety net proposals that say that requiring those who contribute towards legal aid to spend some of their own money up front is requiring them to gamble. All litigants have to make a preliminary assessment as to whether to start a case and they are entitled to look to their legal advisers for skilled advice and competent handling at that stage, which should greatly reduce any element of gamble.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Solicitor-General quoted figures on the rise in unit costs of civil legal aid. Are those figures for all civil legal aid or only for non-matrimonial civil legal aid? Are the figures net or gross? Most non-matrimonial legal aid is recovered by way of the statutory charge against the damages or against the defendant. The figures could be misleading if they are gross figures and include matrimonial legal aid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The figures are for non-matrimonial civil legal aid—for civil legal actions such as personal injury actions. They are gross figures, but they are not misleading. If we were considering the overall cost of the legal aid budget, the net figure would be appropriate. However, the gross figure is relevant in considering the cost to the litigant. I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman should say that the figures were misleading. On reflection, he may think better of it. What matters to clients is the gross figure. The money may be recoverable so that it does not hit the public purse, but it is recoverable out of the damages that that client would otherwise receive. I have made my living as a lawyer for 25 years—in a way, I still do. We must offer a competitive, useful and affordable service to clients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall conclude with some brief references to put the matter into context. The Lord Chancellor made it clear that he has an open mind on the options to which the hon. Member for Norwood referred and which have been put forward in the consultation paper. However, he rejected the approach of simple uprating current eligibility limits, as that can never fulfil the major objective of focusing legal aid on those who really need it and on those who face high costs. Moreover, as the paper also makes clear, in a world where resources are always finite—as we on the Conservative Benches are certainly well aware—any extension of legal aid eligibility depends on improved efficiency in the delivery of services and the control of costs and the sensible desire to target those public resources where they are really needed and can be best deployed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
Any suggestion that legal aid is under attack has to be seen against the background of the enormous increase in actual spending that I outlined at the outset of my speech and of the number of people who have obtained legal aid. Over the 10 years from 1980–81 to 1989–90, the number of new civil legal aid certificates issued, including matrimonial ones, increased by about 112 per cent.—it more than doubled from about 171,000 to about 361,000. Therefore, twice as many people are getting the benefit of advice through civil legal aid certificates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the same period, bills paid for green form advice and assistance very nearly doubled—they increased by 94 per cent., from 532,000 to just over 1 million. About 80 per cent. of people obtaining legal aid certificates and 90 per cent. of people receiving green form advice and assistance did not have to pay any contribution. In that sense, they received an entirely free service. I should qualify that by saying only that something might have been recovered under the system mentioned by the hon. Member for Norwood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Almost all of those applying for legal aid for committal proceedings in the magistrates courts and for trial in the Crown courts are granted representation under legal aid. The hon. Member for Sunderland, South touched on that criminal aspect. About 90 per cent. of those people are not asked to pay any contribution, so that they receive an entirely free service. It is against that background that we are considering the regulations. The Lord Chancellor wishes to consult widely on the proposals in his consultation paper on civil legal aid. He has allowed until 31 October for that, so there will be much opportunity for debate. He does not propose to make any decisions until the consultation period has been completed. Against that background, I commend the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.32 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nellist</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The regulations should be debated on the Floor of the House. If the tabloids are correct that we shall rise on 19th July, we could have had two weeks to debate the regulations in the Chamber. Instead, they are being squeezed through, within 24 hours of a major consultation document being issued. The press presumably had that document for some time before articles, including widespread quotations, appeared in yesterday's 	<i>Evening Standard</i> and in today's morning newspapers. That disadvantages those of us on the Opposition Benches who want to engage in the debate that the Solicitor-General said that he wanted, but an adequate debate is possible only if both sides have the same access to information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing not the cases that usually make the tabloids, such as libel cases involving Elton John or Jeffrey Archer, but the type of case that I discussed with my family solicitor this morning. A woman wanted to secure an order to get her husband out of the house because she feared for the safety of herself and her children. The husband had asked the two children to sit in the car with him. When they refused, he set fire to the car and told the children that he would do a proper job on the house. The woman wanted to get that man out of the house because she was scared to live with an arsonist. She was turned down for legal aid by the Birmingham office on grounds not of cost, but of eligibility.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0289">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
It is that type of personal tragedy that we are discussing—whether people have access to the system and redress for such private and personal problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Norwood (Mr. Fraser) said, the floor has been raised in these regulations. I note from the briefings that I have acquired in the past day or so—principally from the Law Society, the Legal Action Group and the Library, and I pay tribute to all three sources—that 46 years ago the definition of legal aid from the Rushcliffe committee was that it should apply to those of low and moderate means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Successive regulations—those being discussed today are a further turning of the screw—have attacked the ability of those of moderate means to have that access. The Government have never defined what proportion of the population they believe should have access to legal aid. They have given estimates but have never suggested a definition of who should have access to legal aid. My hon. Friend the Member for Norwood quoted some figures. In 1979, the Government estimated that 70 per cent. of the population had access—Lord Hailsham used that figure as recently as 1986. A White Paper was published in 1987 and changed the word "population" to "households", which was the first sign of a massive cut in the figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was from that point that Mr Murphy, the highly respected mathematician and statistician and member of staff of the London School of Economics, gave estimates, on behalf of the Legal Action Group and the Law Society. Those estimates initially gave a figure of 14 million people and the most recent figure put as high as 16 million the number of people who in the past 12 years have dropped through the net of the regulations and are now no longer eligible. I believe that the bulk of them would be within that original description of those of moderate means. That is why the Opposition are so opposed to the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to repeat the arguments of my hon. Friend the Member for Norwood, but because the regulations will do nothing to raise the upper limits of income or capital, I believe that they prepare the ground for the document which dares not speak its name, and about which we must not talk too much today, for the privatisation of legal aid. Just as the British United Provident Association has a part in the privatisation of health, the regulations are about the privatisation of legal aid. People must spend up to a couple of thousand pounds of their own money before they are entitled to receive free advice and to get proper access to the legal system. By not operating the regulations properly, the ground is being prepared to make the solutions more acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that sense, the matter is bound in with today's debate. The Solicitor-General is right about that, although we cannot have a fair and even debate because we have not had the opportunity of reading the proposals. The cost of legal aid was a major point made by the Solicitor-General when he talked about £700 million in the past five years. However, I do not believe that he answered adequately the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, South about whether, in precise numbers, the proportion of the rise could be divided between the number of extra cases and the rise in the costs of those who provide the service. If the Solicitor-General could write to us about that, I should find that information useful. As my hon. Friend the
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
Member for Norwood said, the proportion of the population who are now eligible for legal aid has dropped below the 40 per cent. mark to 37 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations are being made under the Legal Aid Act 1988. I want to vote against them not only because of what they contain but because what they could have included. Section 34(3) of the 1988 Act states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Regulations may also modify this Act for the purposes of its application to prescribed descriptions of persons or in prescribed circumstances."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, within the regulations that we are discussing this morning, there could have been an extension of the number of people who would be eligible for legal aid—not just on financial grounds, but on grounds of poll tax. I know that the matter is separate, but the poll tax regulations and legislation allow solicitors and barristers to represent people in magistrates courts when liability orders are discussed, or, as is now happening in 37 local authorities, when committal proceedings are discussed. The legal aid system does not allow solicitors or barristers to be paid for representing people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At 3.5 p.m. on Friday, I received a telephone call at my office in Coventry from a constituent, Mr. Ali, who was about to be arrested. He was taken to the police station. Within half an hour of that happening, I managed to contact my family solicitor and arrange for him to go to the court. By conducting a proper means inquiry, it was discovered that Mr. Ali was £8,000 in debt because his business had collapsed. Once the magistrates heard that my constituent was paying off his debts by credit card, they adjourned the court hearing for a month to enable a proper inquiry into his background to take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would not have happened if my solicitor had not taken part in the court proceedings. Solicitors in Coventry charge about £50 an hour for their services. As can be seen from the schedule attached to the regulations, charges vary for the different work that is undertaken. I shall have to pay the £50 to my solicitor. However, as he is a good friend and is also sympathetic to the case, I hope that he does not charge me the full amount. I might have to pay those fees so that my constituent is given the right which is provided by one part of the law but, which the regulations do not cover by allowing solicitors or barristers to be paid to defend him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, there are 37 local authorities and, so far, 20 people have been imprisoned because of the poll tax. I refer to the first such case, that of Brian Wright of Grantham. Because someone was able to pass a rebate form to him in prison, he was released after 14 days instead of the 21 days to which he was sentenced. I contend that if he had had the services of a solicitor at his committal hearing and if he had been able to apply for legal aid, he would not necessarily have been sentenced to imprisonment. He certainly would not have been sentenced to 21 days' imprisonment, although he might have been sentenced to 14. I shall elaborate my argument tomorrow when I see the Lord Chancellor, who has been good enough to grant me an appointment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Solicitor-General should not have just presented a financial package of regulations today but should have widened the regulations under section 34 of the 1988 Act. Access to justice is only a reality if people have help with the cost of bringing a case to court. That no one would be financially unable to prosecute a just and reasonable claim or defend a legal right is the basis for the legal aid system.

The regulations reduce the eligibility of people for help from the legal aid system both in financial terms and because of their tightly drawn scope, thus denying millions of people access to legal aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a letter to 	<i>The Independent</i> on 19 March, the director of the Legal Action Group said that the regulations and the White Paper to which the Solicitor-General referred are creating a
	<br><blockquote><p>"'poverty trap', whereby those who manage to increase their earnings above the minimum levels of income simply drive themselves into further poverty"</p></blockquote>
because, under the regulations, they will no longer be eligible for legal aid. On the grounds of the financial implications and the scope of the regulations, I support my hon. Friends in opposing the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.43 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall begin with the argument advanced by the Solicitor-General that one reason for depressing the eligibility for legal aid by freezing the upper limits of income and capital is the escalating costs of the legal aid scheme. My hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin) referred to that point, too. The escalating costs of counsel which my hon. Friend mentioned are generally not the escalating costs that fall within the legal aid scheme. Moreover, legal aid practitioners complain that the rates of remuneration for undertaking non-legal aid work are now about two or three times higher than the rate of remuneration for legal aid practitioners. Many legal aid practitioners are being driven out of business because they cannot afford to hire staff or cannot earn sufficient money to maintain their legal aid practice. A first-class and second-class legal service is developing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mullin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept what my hon. Friend said. I know many honourable solicitors whose entire time is taken up with legal aid work and who are grossly underpaid. I believe that it takes a year or even 18 months for them to be paid. I do not wish to tar people with the same brush. My remarks were directed primarily at counsel because I am aware of the high fees paid to counsel from the legal aid budget. However, as the Solicitor-General said, the cases of which I am aware are criminal, not civil cases, with which we are dealing here. I cannot believe that there is much difference between the two.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a difference. However, the difference may not be quite so marked with criminal matters because of the control on the level of fees paid to criminal counsel employed by the state. I do not want anyone reading the record to run away with the idea that increases in remuneration are mainly responsible for increases in the budget. That is not the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the main causes of the increase in the legal aid budget over the past 12 years is the inability of the Conservative Government to do anything about crime. If the level of crime doubles in 12 years, there is likely to be a doubling of legal aid orders to defend people accused of crimes. The rise in crime—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Greg Knight 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derby, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Reported crime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says, "Reported crime." We are talking about people charged with crimes. The number of people charged with crimes—and as my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, South would say,
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
in some cases wrongly charged with crimes—has escalated under the Conservative Government and so has the cost of defending them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neilist</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend knows more about this than I do, but the Government's legislation has also played a role. There are things such as the duty solicitor scheme, which have added to people's rights as well as their duties, and have increased the demands on the legal aid system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to go on to that point and to add that a quid pro quo for Parliament granting additional rights to the police in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 was greater protection for those arrested and questioned by the police. The duty solicitor scheme, attendance at police stations and extensions of certain forms of advice for those charged with criminal offences have cost more, and that comes within the total budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reject the implication of the Solicitor-General's argument that somehow the quality of justice that someone receives will depend on the size of the budget. We had always understood that, like the health service, legal aid was a demand-led service and that the quality of the assistance and advice received should not depend solely on financial factors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the Solicitor-General says is rather worse than that. He says that because of the consultation document and because new ways of dealing with legal aid are under discussion, possibly for two or three years, the upper limit for eligibility for legal aid will be frozen. That is an extraordinary proposition. An analogy is of a housewife who does not receive enough money from her husband. The husband comes home one day and says, "I am freezing your housekeeping allowance of the next two or three years because I have another scheme in mind. I may give you a bigger share of my pension or a bigger share of my capital, but while I am thinking about it, your housekeeping will be frozen." I am sure that if someone dealt with the remuneration of the Solicitor-General or of the Lord Chancellor or his officials on the basis that it would be frozen until another scheme was thought up, they would reject the idea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Solicitor-General goes on to say that one reason is the increase in the costs of the cases. So, because the unit costs of cases have increased—because the lions are getting more voracious—he will expose more individuals to the lions. Fewer and fewer people will be eligible for legal aid. It is an extraordinary piece of logic—if it were true. I think that it is just a rationalisation—a cover-up—for taking about 1 million people out of eligibility for criminal legal aid by failing to update the regulations.

If we had had the opportunity, Mr. Hogg, we should have voted against the regulations. It is regrettable that we did not get the chance to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the debate has concluded, and before I put the Question, I wish to put my own statement on record. I have had time to reflect on the proceedings this morning. My rulings made clear the status of the consultation paper compared with the regulations formally before us. However, the Committee is aware of the difficulty caused by the non-availability of the consultation paper. I make it clear—I hope that my words will be taken to heart beyond this Room—that events of this sort are discourteous to a Committee charged by the House with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0291">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
the consideration of important business. This event put the Chair in an exceedingly difficult position. I hope that we will experience nothing like it again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
