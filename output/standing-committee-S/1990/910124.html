	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. Richard Needham)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Road Traffic (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 1991.</p></q>
The order paves the way for a new unified driver licensing system in Northern Ireland, comparable to that in Great Britain. We are introducing a centrally issued licence which shows all the groups of vehicles which a person may drive. This will enable us to meet our European Community commitments under the first council directive, and improved international recognition of the licence will help our professional drivers abroad. All will benefit from a streamlined licensing system and the lower costs at the driver licensing central office will lead to lower fees for vocational licences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In future, licences to drive any prescribed class of goods vehicle or vehicles with fare-paying passenges will be renewed every five years once drivers are over 45; we will also require a medical report for renewal of this category. Holders of ordinary driving licences who drive minibuses with up to 17 seats which are not used for hire or reward are not affected by this new system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Northern Ireland has, I regret appalling road casualty statistics and the Government have set a target to reduce serious road casualties by one third over the next 10 years. The following articles in this order will assist in that aim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Motor cycles and mopeds make up a small percentage of total traffic but they account for a substantially higher percentage of accidents. Article 7 makes training of new motot cyclists compulsory by imposing limitations on provisional licences. It will be illegal for a motor cyclist to be on the road unless he is being trained or has completed a training course. The order will also limit the size of learner motor cycles to 125cc and introduce a power-weight ratio. I have agreed that 12 months's notice of implementation should be given to allow existing provisional licence holders either to pass the test or to change their 250cc machines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part III of the order introduces the first major change for more than 20 years in Northern Ireland's drink-driving laws, which will be brought into line with Great Britain. The existing major and minor offences will be replaced with a single offence of driving or being in charge of a motor vehicle with alcohol concentration above the limit of 80mg in 100m1 of blood. A hand-held screening device will, I hope, increase the detection rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be three differences from the law in Great Britain. First, evidential breath tests will continue to be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
carried out at the roadside. I see no reason to discontinue the use of these tests. Secondly, disqualification for a minimum period of 12 months, and endorsement, will be obligatory for those found guilty of a drink-driving offence. Someone can regain a licence only by retaking the driving test and he or she will have to go back through the "R" plate proceedings which apply in the province to newly qualified drivers. The third difference from the law in Great Britain is the removal of the hip-flask defence. During consultations on the order in Northern Ireland there was strong opposition to the inclusion of such a defence, so I have, as a result, agreed that it should no longer be allowed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a welcome measure which will simplify licensing procedures, improve the training of motor cyclists and target more effectively the irresponsible driver who drinks too much. I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.34 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Stott 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wigan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I mean no discourtesy to the Committee if I have to leave our proceedings, but I am also a member of the Committee considering the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Antrim, South (Mr. Forsythe) and I have sat on a number of Statutory Instruments Committees and made the usual complaints about the unsatisfactory way in which Northern Ireland business is dealt with in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This order is important and welcome, but it is a fait accompli. We can do nothing about the order except discuss it; we cannot amend it. We should find a better way of debating Northern Ireland issues rather than the Minister telling the Committee "This is the way it is; we cannot do anything about it."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his introductory remarks, the Minister talked about consultation. When the order is passed, it will become law. Will the Minister tell us how much consultation he had with the relevant bodies in Northern Ireland when the order was drafted? I spoke to Mr. O'Callaghan, a senior officer in the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers' Union, whose members work in the road transport industry, and I shall flag up one or two of his observations about the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Category B car licence drivers with this entitlement will automatically be entitled to drive vehicles in sub-category DI, which is a nine to 17-seat minibus not used for hire or reward. The ATGWU believes that this would be a backdoor method of attacking its industry and the people who have public service vehicle licences. The Minister should take that point on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ATGWU is also worried about the minimum age for driving all passenger-carrying vehicles with more than eight seats. It believes that the age should be retained at 21 years and not reduced to 18 years, which is a fair point. The ATGWU is concerned about driving instruction. It wants tuition to drive a PCV vehicle to be undertaken by a qualified instructor, not just by someone with a full driving licence. With regard to a provisional licence, the union wants a person to be in possession of a valid PCV provisional driving licence before beginning to drive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the thorough screening methods of prospective drivers used by Ulsterbus, Citybus and Flexibus, who are given proper tuition by qualified instructors before a licence is issued, we have a case for commencing training when a provisional licence is applied for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are some of the points that the ATGWU asked me to raise in Committee. But there are two other issues that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0626">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
are not covered by the order. Public Service Vehicle Operators Licence (International) believes that each passenger-carrying vehicle should display a second disc in its windscreen. That will ensure visible proof that the vehicle is being operated under that licence when journeys are undertaken between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister give us his thoughts in respect of bus lanes in Belfast, which also concerns the union?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.37 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifford Forsythe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Antrim, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give a general welcome to the order. We require differences in legislation in Northern Ireland because of the high number of deaths and accidents. We hope that the order will improve that position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I join the hon. Member for Wigan (Mr. Stott) in complaining about the standard procedure and about this legislation being an Order in Council. I have become fond of the House of Commons and I am proud to be an hon. Member of such a democratic House. However, I am continually and greatly offended because instead of considering new legislation for Northern Ireland in the same way as legislation is considered for the rest of the United Kingdom, which is debated and can be amended, we cannot change a comma, full stop or anything else in the order. Many hon. Members would agree with me that that is undemocratic. In spite of that, I welcome the order, although there are many questions that I want to ask the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Articles 3 and 4 refer to driver licensing and the aim is to bring Northern Ireland into harmony with European legislation. Many hon. Members do not share that aim. The hon. Member for Southend, East (Mr. Taylor) and other hon. Members complained in a debate on Tuesday evening about what would happen if the new Committees were introduced. Legislation is being introduced in this Committee that will be enacted in a very short time and without amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be useful for licensing to be integrated so that all driving categories are under one system. That would be most useful for drivers going to the continent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to hear that those over 45 years of age would have to take a new test every five years. Fortunately, I am not a driver of heavy goods vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 6 on page 4 of the order refers to taxi drivers. It is right that someone using his own car as a taxi should have to take a further driving test and have a separate taxi dirver's licence. What measures are taken to ensure that the vehicle that he drives is tested? The driver will have a licence, which shows that he is competent to use his car as a taxi, and he should have to show that the car being used as a taxi is safe in good mechanical order and suitable for that business enterprise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome article 7, which refers to motor cycle learners. It is an excellent proposal. Young men have ended up in a ditch because of their enthusiasm for their machines. It is right that the cubic capacity of machines ridden by learner drivers should be reduced. I am glad that the Minister intends to allow one year to elapse before the measure is introduced. It would be nice if the lads could be competent riders before they took their machines on to the road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 7(5)(b) refers to
	<br><q><p>"the approval by the Department of the persons providing the courses and the withdrawal of its approval".</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
Whom does the Department consider to be a competent or suitable instructor? Will the Minister give us an idea of the Department's thinking on the matter? Article 7(5) refers to
	<br><q><p>"(c) the maximum amount of any charges payable"</p></q>
and
	<br><q><p>"(e) the making, in connection with the supply of forms of certificates, of reasonable charges for discharge of the functions of the Department."</p></q>
What would be the maximum amounts for (c) or (e)? If we knew those we would know who would be allowed to give instructions, how much they could charge and, how much the Department could charge for the certificates. No doubt the Department will keep the figure as low as it can to keep inflation down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 8, which relates to drinking and driving or drug-taking and driving, is important. I welcome the continuation of evidential roadside tests. The proposed new article 143(3) to the principal order states:
	<br><q><p>"a person shall be deemed not to have been in charge of a motor vehicle if he proves that at the material time the circumstances were such that there was no likelihood of his driving it so long as he remained unfit to drive through drink or drugs."</p></q>
If the person sitting in the car were intoxicated or incapable and he did not have the car keys in his possession, would that be a defence?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed new article 146(3) to the principal order states:
	<br><q><p>"A requirement under paragraph (1)(a) may be made only by a constable who is especially authorised by the Chief Constable to make such requirements."</p></q>
Does that mean that only certain members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary can carry out the evidential roadside tests and that not all constables can operate the machine?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed new article 147(3) to the principal order states:
	<br><q><p>"The Department may by regulations substitute another proportion of alcohol in the breath for that specified in paragraph (2)."</p></q>
Does the Department anticipate a further lowering of the limit or is that a precautionary measure?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new articles 146 and 152 to the principal order relate to the failure to give a sample. If a driver fails to do that and is taken to court, is the court automatically obliged to disqualify him for 12 months, endorse his licence, make him sit a test and travel for 12 months with R plates? Can the court change the penalty? Has it any option or must it automatically pass all those sentences?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances or when someone is convicted of driving while over the alcohol intake limit, can that person drive again after disqualification but before passing the test? Do the provisions mean that, until the disqualification period is over, a person cannot sit the test? If so, that person would apply for a test and there could be a delay of two or three weeks or more before he is allowed to sit it. Will he be entitled to drive immediately after the disqualification and while he waits for a test or will he not be permitted to drive until he has passed the test?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the proposed legislation, apart from the few exceptions that I have mentioned, and I hope that the Minister will be able to answer some of my questions. I agree that sterner legislation is required. However, I remind the Minister of some dangers on the road. Some junctions are dangerous, as is the state of some roads. At some junctions the grass has not been cut so that one cannot see down the road in either direction. When there is frost or snow, some roads are not gritted. I need not refer to the A26

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
because the Minister is to have a meeting with me on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.51 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Hayward 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kingswood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no intention of discussing regulations that apply to people who are over the age of 45. I shall leave them for those Members of the Committee who are better qualified to comment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wigan (Mr. Stott) spoke about minibuses. I understand that dispensation is generally afforded to charities and schools, which use the facility widely. I do not wish to see a change in those regulations in any part of the country which would debar the substantial use that charities and schools make of a facility that is not available in other parts of Europe. I am sure that the hon. Member would not wish to see such changes either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Road Traffic Bill, which is also being considered in Committee, will substantially change the drink-drive legislation. We welcome that, although some of us feel that the legislation will not go far enough. Is there provision in the order for any changes that will be made in that proposed legislation for Northern Ireland? Any legislation that saves lives is welcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.52 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Needham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I shall respond to the speeches by the hon. Members for Wigan (Mr. Stott) and for Antrim, South (Mr. Forsythe).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No hon. Member likes the present system of legislating for Northern Ireland. However, the ritual incantation by the hon. Member for Wigan about that system would be slightly more persuasive if he proposed a sensible alternative. We use the present system because we are dealing with transferred matters. If a devolved Administration were created for Northern Ireland, those transferred legislative matters would be debated and agreed by that new administrative assembly or Government of Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, in the interim, the hon. Member for Wigan has some bright idea that would make those matters more amendable without breaking his party's long-term committment to devolution, we should all be happy to hear it. However, in the six years that I have been a Minister, I have heard only ritual criticisms of the present system. The hon. Members for Wigan and for Antrim, South have both made such criticisms. When we proceed from talks about talks to talks about other things, we might find some alternative to the present legislative system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsythe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we had a Northern Ireland Committee, it would be possible for Northern Ireland legislation to be dealt with by a Standing Committee in the meantime. If the Minister wants to find a solution, he should work on the basis of that reasonable suggestion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Needham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to incur your wrath, Mr. Hill, by going down routes and byeways that are not part of the order. However, to have a Northern Ireland Committee would not greatly change the composition of its Members. The hon. Member for Wigan asked how many bodies had been consulted about the order. Mr. O'Callaghan, a friend for whom I have considerable respect, was one, at least, who bothered to reply to us. Of the 250 bodies that we consulted, only 12 responded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
The hon. Member for Wigan asked whether driving licence holders with category B entitlement should be permitted to drive minibuses with between nine and 17 seats. I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. I also understand the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Kingswood (Mr. Hayward) about those who voluntarily drive such minibuses without hire or reward. However, the second European directive, which controls these matters, will ensure that the entitlement is deleted so that everyone who drives such vehicles will have to pass the relevant test. That is right, because I cannot think of any reason why a person should be allowed under different conditions to drive a minibus in which children or the elderly are passengers simply because he drives voluntarily rather than with paying customers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayward</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Department of Transport agree with that because for a long time it has opposed that idea?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Needham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give the views of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport. I can give only the details of the second directive, which will bite upon us as does the first directive. I am giving the views of the Minister responsible for transport matters in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Kingswood asked about the mimimum age for driving passenger-carrying vehicles and said that there was concern that the minimum age of 21 would not be retained. I assure him that it will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wigan asked whether tuition to drive a public service vehicle should be undertaken by guided instructors and not by full licence holders. I note what the hon. Gentleman and Mr. O'Callaghan said. We have no evidence that tuition for driving such vehicles requires special qualification. Ulsterbus, Citybus and Flexibus undertake their own training, using their experienced staff, and the system has worked satisfactorily for them. We have no evidence that the present training system is unsatisfactory.

Asked why a person must possess a valid passenger carrying vehicle provisional licence before beginning to drive. The Government's view is that it is crucial that a person who intends to take the test has a full physical examination. People who pass that test undertake an important job and we must ensure that they are fit to do it, whether they are above or below the age of 45.

I was asked whether each passenger-carrying vehicle should display a disc on its windscreen. Similar proposals for displaying an insurance disc have been made in the past. The difficulty is that the documentation on the windscreen might not always relate to the driver of the vehicle. I undertake to the hon. Member for Wigan to look again at the suggestion.

Mr O'Callaghan has always had firm views about bus lanes for Belfast and I am sympathetic to the idea of their implementation. However, that could not be done without some difficulty because bus lanes exclude other traffic. In Oxford Street in Belfast, for example, around the Royal Courts of Justice, where one lane had been taken away because of construction works, traffic can be backed up for a considerable distance. We must strike a balance between the use of bus lanes, light transit systems, and multi-storey car parks. In the Belfast urban area plan, we have shown considerable commitment to move towards an integrated strategy for public and private transport. That will be unique in the island of Ireland and shows real flair and imagination. We are considering that and there may well be

areas in which we can have bus lanes. However, that needs to be looked at in terms of the whole transport strategy.

The hon. Member for Antrim, South asked about the time it had taken for this first Council of Ministers directive to be implemented. He is right to say that we are implementing council directives agreed by the Commission and the Council of Ministers. The first Council directive was issued in 1980 and we have not exactly flown towards its implementation. I am sure that the hon. Member for Antrim, South will agree that we have a common policy throughout Europe upon them.

The hon. Gentleman asked about taxis and tests. Vehicles are subject to an annual test before they can be used as taxis. That testing ensures that they are in a proper, roadworthy condition. I am sure, and insist, that those tests are rigorously undertaken and upheld. The hon. Gentleman also asked who would organise the compulsory basic training courses for learner motor cyclists. Northern Ireland uses the same criteria for appointing course organisers as the Department of Transport. Everybody who wishes to organise training must successfully complete the Department of Transport instructor's course held at Cardington, Wales.

The hon. Gentleman asked about the level of fees to which I have the most wonderfully bureaucratic answer. Fees have not yet been agreed, because it will be at least 12 months before these provisions take effect. I heard exactly what the hon. Member for Antrim, South said, and I shall look at the level of fees, write to the hon. Gentleman and give him an opportunity to comment. Clearly, that is an important issue.

The traffic branch of the RUC will undertake testing. Members of that branch are trained in the use of the equipment, having used it for a considerable time. The hon. Member for Antrim, South jangled his keys in his pocket. I am not sure whether that indicates that something happened to him or to a friend. Knowing the hon. Gentleman as well as I do, I hope that it does not indicate that something happened to him. It is for a court to decide
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
whether in the circumstances that he described, keys may have slipped from a pocket into the well of the car.

We have no intention at the moment to lower the limits. With the exception of three instances, the measure brings the law in Northern Ireland into line with the law here. The wording is precautionary rather than intentive. The offence is obligatory and not at the court's discretion. The punishment for being above the limit is set out in the order and when the person convicted has finished his 12-month period, or whatever the court decides, he has to take out a provisional licence. Therefore, the question of him driving before his test is taken depends on whether he has somebody with him, and he has a provisional licence. He cannot drive on his own before he resits the test.

The hon. Member for Antrim, South spoke about the roads and the need to grit them and cut grass verges. He knows that that constant battle has been waged in Northern Ireland and will continue to be waged during summer and winter. The roads department of the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland does its level best. In general, we have a road system of which we can be proud.

The hon. Member for Kingswood spoke about the Road Traffic Bill. Northern Ireland legislation follows that, and we try to make it follow as fast as we can. therefore the catching-up exercise in which the Road Traffic Bill is engaged in order to comply with the EC directive will be considered by us in a later order. We shall try to do that quickly in Northern Ireland because we realise the benefits of bringing our legislation into line with the rest of Britain and Europe.
