	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed,</i> [	<i>19 February</i>]: No. 35, in page 1, line 21, after "Scotland," insert "and its coastal waters".—[	<i>Mr. Macdonald.</i>]</p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following: </div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>New clause 2—	<i>Provision of advice in relation to marine fish farm licences</i>—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1)SNH shall provide advice to the Crown Estate Commissioners and local planning authorities on the location and size of proposed marine fish farms and the effects such fish farm proposals are likely to have on the natural heritage of Scotland.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Where the Crown Estate Commissioners intend to grant or renew a sea-bed lease for a fish farm against the advice of SNH and of the local planning authority the matter shall be referred to the Secretary of State to be determined by him.".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>Amendment No. 8, in clause 4, page 3, line 29, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(11) SNH shall be notified of all proposed marine developments, including fish farming, and shall advise the Secretary of State on these matters.".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian Wilson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cunninghame, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. You may recall that on Tuesday the Minister, in a somewhat unsatisfactory, half-baked manner, gave half a statement on the Government's intentions on clause 11. Is it in order to ask the Minister to spell out the Government's intentions rather more clearly?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to the issues that arise from clause 11, we have heard nothing yet about the Government's intentions on the other Lords amendments, particularly to clause 5. As my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) said, until we know what the Government intend to do, we shall be operating in a vacuum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help. I gave the Minister an opportunity to speak on clause 11, but it was because of objections from Opposition Members that I prevented the Minister from going further. My ruling stands: we shall have to wait until we come to clause 11 to discuss the matter. We shall continue with the amendments before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. I am an assiduous reader of 	<i>The Daily Telegraph.</i> On page 8 of this morning's
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
edition, under the byline of Charles Clover, there is quite a substantial piece about the Committee's work. It gives the impression that it was based on a briefing from the Scottish Office. Can a statement be made about what was said to Mr. Clover?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That has absolutely nothing to do with the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. We face the worst of both worlds. I fully understand the difficulty, but we have discovered that, although a few paragraphs of a statement were read here on Tuesday, that statement had already been issued to the press. We are in a half-way house as there is public discussion of matters about which the Committee has not formally been notified. The Government have made their intentions clear outside, but not to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again, I reiterate that the hon. Gentleman had his opportunity to raise this on Tuesday. He objected strongly and I accepted his objection. The hon. Gentleman cannot have his cake and eat it. My job is not to worry about what statements are made to the press by either side or what the press prints, but to go through the amendments before the Committee as speedily as possible. Therefore, I ask the hon. Gentleman to continue his speech on amendment No. 35.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that. We return to marine developments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Tuesday, I spoke about the development of fish-farming and the patent absurdity of extremely large marine developments, such as fish-farms, which may entail no local authority involvement. Although lip service is paid to a planning authority's involvement and that of the Nature Conservancy Council for Scotland when it comes to the bit, it is within the gift of the Crown Estate commissioners to overrule both.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fish-farming is the main example of such behaviour, but it is by no means the only one. Over the years, the Crown Estate commissioners have been involved in some ludicrous episodes. They approved developments on various parts of the coastline only to find that such plans cut across different aims that were being pursued by other more democratic authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Development Agency's plans to build a marina at Ballachulish, for example, were wrecked by the Crown Estate commissioners' different proposals for leases of the seabed. Permission was given by the commissioners for mineral exploration of the seabed off the coast of the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson). There was much talk about minerals in the waters around the Western Isles and of oil exploration in the Minch. None of those proposals received any meaningful input from other agencies than are more legitimately concerned with such matters than the Crown Estate commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is not a perfect vehicle for changing that process but, clearly, each activity to which I have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0029">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
referred has a substantial environmental implication. It is more than logical to give Scottish Natural Heritage a role to play in such issues as it would be anomalous not to give it such a role. What happens offshore can have a direct environmental implication on what happens on land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no political division about the proposed change. It would be a logical extension of the powers that are proposed for SNH, and it would help to clear up the glaring anomaly of local planning authorities and environmental bodies than have not had a meaningful input into matters that are of great importance to the community. The new agency would like the new clause to be approved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have two questions for the Minister. I refer first to the powers of the new organisation in relation to woodland owners and the Forestry Commission, which allows supra-phosphates and related chemicals to run into lochs, possibly as a result of the spraying by helicopters of young plantations. That happens on a large scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Highland River Purification Board is worried about the phosphorous content of Loch Shin. I am sure that it is technically right about that. It says that it may be due partly to the feeding of the salmon fry and salmon smolts and the development of salmon farming. Moreover, the board has opposed some salmon-farming developments on those grounds. Fish-farmers tell me, however, that there is little phosphorous in the excrement and that there will be even less phosphorous in the new types of feeds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That problem is minuscule when compared with the amount of spraying undertaken by the Forestry Commission, the Scottish Woodlands Association and other owners of large woodlands. Salmon fry used to swim up many of the burns, but since the construction of the hydro dam, it has become almost impossible for them to find their way out of Loch Shin or in from the sea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Salmon farming in Loch Shin is commercially important to the community. Councillor the Reverend Alec Murray of Lairg said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"God meant that Loch Shin should once again have young salmon fry and parr."</p></blockquote>
This is a serious matter and there are strong feelings about it in the highlands, as always. Mrs Gillian Pattinson has taken a case to court. It is not sub judice at present because I have carefully checked the details. It will be a test case. What powers will the SNH have to stop the Forestry Commission and other woodland owners spraying chemicals on a large scale if such spraying is against the technical judgment of organisations such as the Highland River Purification Board?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last night, Lord Chorley, the chairman of the National Trust, told me that the trust had undertaken a study of the marine coastal environment of England and Scotland. What contact has there been between the Scottish Office and the National Trust, with its history of involvement in our coastal environment? However, if the Minister says that that matter will be raised later in our proceedings, I shall accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an important and interesting debate. I can tell my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, North-West (Mr. Bellingham) that research is being undertaken into the effect of the crossbreeding between fish that have escaped from fish-farms and wild stocks. The conclusions of that research will be made known in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) referred to freshwater fish-farming. Such operations are covered by planning control regulations. However, the point to which the hon. Gentleman referred probably comes under the remit of the river purification authorities. I shall obtain the up-to-date facts about Loch Shin for him. Obviously, the NCC has jurisdiction over potentially damaging operations on sites of special scientific interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked about coastal environment. We have been in touch with the Department of the Environment about under-water archaeology, a matter in which the Historic Buildings and Monuments Directorate is extremely interested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister, at his convenience, set out the legal position in relation to the general issues connected with Loch Shin?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I shall look into the matter, and I will give the hon. Gentleman the relevant details as soon as I am able to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should stress at the outset that the Scottish Office supports the development of the marine fish-farming industry to achieve long-term economic and social benefits to local communities, but it can only be used in a sustainable manner. I am grateful to the honourable Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) for tabling the amendments and for allowing me the opportunity to stress the important role that we expect SNH to play in marine environment. Certainly, it is our intention that SNH should play an enhanced role in that context. The Bill makes adequate provision for SNH to operate in that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There simply is no need for amendment No. 35. The legal definition of Scotland for most purposes, including those in the Bill, includes territorial waters which extend generally to a range of three miles. Therefore, I trust that the hon. Gentleman will accept that there is no need for his amendment. The Committee will be aware that many coastal features of Scotland are unique and contain aquatic life forms that are found in virtually no other environment. SNH will take over the important work of the NCC in that area. That work will not be diminished, rather it will be enhanced. In any event, the term "coastal waters" without definition would give rise to difficulties of interpretation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the much wider marine environment and all that that entails, it would not be reasonable to expect that SNH could possibly hope to cover every single cubic metre of the ocean. Nevertheless, we certainly intend that it should have a broad view of, and play a developed role in, such an environment. The development of our understanding
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0030">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
of marine life is continually evolving, and I hope that SNH will play a significant part in this research and development. In the wider area beyond territorial waters SNH will be able to play a role in conjunction with the Joint Nature Conservancy Committee as those waters would be considered as international territory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I trust that that will satisfy the hon. Member for Western Isles and that the reassurances that I have given on SNH's marine and aquatic role will allay his fears.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to nit-pick, but when the Minister uses the expression "a broad view of", what does that cover?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It covers the whole environment and relevant matters. SNH will not want to become bogged down in unimportant details, but it will have flexibility to choose priorities that it considers to be important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On new clause 2, I recognise and understand the anxiety of the hon. Member for Western Isles to safeguard the role of SNH in the development of the marine fish-farming industry. It is our intention that SNH will continue the existing work of the NCC and the Countryside Commission for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The advice of the statutory bodies concerned with nature conservation and landscape matters has been an important component in the development of Government policy towards the fish-farming industry and it is important that the role of SNH is developed further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However I do not believe that the new clause is necessary or appropriate. As members of the Committee will know, clause 2(1)(a) and (b) place a general duty on SNH to advise both Ministers and the wider public on a wide range of matters concerned with the natural heritage of Scotland. Marine fish-farming is, of course, an industry with clear implications for the natural heritage of Scotland and will, therefore, be an obvious area of activity for SNH. Rather than specify which types of advice SNH should provide, we have deliberately drafted the clause in a general sense to allow the new body wide flexibility in deciding its priorities. I therefore trust that the hon. Member for Western Isles will agree that the first part of the new clause is unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the second part of the new clause, members of the Committee should be aware that an advisory committee considers cases when a consultee objects to a proposed decision by the Crown Estate commissioners on the granting of a lease. Both the NCC and the CCS sit on this committee, as does the local authority involved. The committee's chairman and vice-chairman are appointed by the Secretary of State and can recommend that a case be referred to the Secretary of State if the advisory committee is unable to resolve it. The advisory committee is now fully operational and is, I believe, a valuable mechanism that provides the opportunity to discuss in depth questions of concern relating to individual cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the relationship between SNH and the Crown Estate commissioners, I understand from previous Bills that the Crown Estate commissioners represent a grey area in the law. What powers will SNH have over the commissioners? There have been difficulties in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have set up the advisory committee and we shall establish locational guidelines, which will help. If the hon. Member for Linlithgow wants SNH to have powers, that would involve United Kingdom legislation, which goes beyond the terms of the Bill. I am not advocating that to the Committee at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of new clause 2 would be to bypass the advisory committee and provide for automatic referral to the Secretary of State if SNH or the local authority maintained an objection. I do not think that that would be appropriate, since it would undermine the effectiveness of this valuable mechanism. Referral to the Secretary of State for decision is not ruled out in current circumstances if the chairman of the committee thinks it appropriate, but that would happen only after the matter had been given full consideration by the main parties involved in the advisory committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the new clause will not be pressed to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister tell us when the advisory committee was set up, how often it has met and how many cases it has dealt with? My questions are rhetorical to some extent, because the advisory committee that he is defending is a non-event and widely recognised to be so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that the advisory committee was set up some time ago. It has certainly considered one case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The committee would be available to consider controversial cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Western Isles asked why the Crown Estate commissioners granted leases on applications that were opposed by the Nature Conservancy Council for Scotland. All applications for fish-farming leases are notified to the NCC, the Countryside Commission for Scotland, local authorities and other statutory bodies. The Crown Estate commissioners try to resolve objections by agreeing to reject or modify the development proposals. If agreement cannot be reached, objections are then referred to the advisory committee, and the NCC, the Countryside Commission for Scotland and other relevant statutory bodies are represented. I understand that no leases have been approved against the advice of the NCC since the committee became operational. That is an important point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we made clear in our response to the Select Committee on Agriculture, the Government believe that the current system of control or marine and fish-farming developments should be allowed to evolve.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0031">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
The new locational guidelines that will be drawn up by the Scottish Office, in consultation with outside interests, will act as a benchmark for the work of the Crown Estate commissioners and those bodies that make up the advisory committee. The guidelines will provide a valuable tool for the work of those considering the industry's future, but we shall also keep the procedures and activities of the advisory committee under review, to ensure its effectiveness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Calum Macdonald 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Western Isles)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that one of the problems is that there are no fixed rules governing the operation of the advisory committee? The Crown Estate commissioners decide whether agreement is reached over a contentious lease. Often, the parties that have opposed a lease will dispute the fact that there has been a subsequent agreement or compromise over the terms of a lease. When the Minister says that no contentious leases have been approved since the advisory committee became operational, that is something of a sleight of hand, because it took almost a year for that committee to be up and running and during that time there were some contentious leases that were opposed by the NCC but approved by the Crown Estate commissioners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman. I should have liked the advisory committee to be operational earlier, but it is now operating effectively. I believe that the evolutionary approach, referred to by the Select Committee on Agriculture, is the one to adopt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, the advisory committee was established in 1989, and I said that it has considered one case. There are rules of procedure agreed by the advisory committee and the Crown Estate commissioners. We are satisfied with the role that the Crown Estate commissioners have played in the development of the marine fish-farming industry generally, but we are certainly not complacent. I mention the important role played by the advisory committee in allowing contentious matters to be discussed round the table by the main interested parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee may also be aware that officials from the Scottish Office, and a wide range of interested parties, are currently drawing up the guidelines on the location and siting of marine fish-farms. We believe that that will be a way forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I clarify my previous intervention? I do not suggest that there should be a great witch hunt against the Crown Estate commissioners, because I do not regard them as bad people. The situation is complicated and I welcome the idea of round-table discussions. If they had taken place in the past, some of the difficulties might not have arisen. I want to make it clear that some of us are not agin the Crown Estate commssioners in all circumstances, but we consider it important that the round-table discussions should be accessible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is in line with the evolutionary approach recommended by the
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
Select Committee and being adopted by the Scottish Office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that very point—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me develop the point and then I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman. We are not complacent about control of the industry. A number of authorities are involved. River purification authorities throughout Scotland play an important role in regulating discharges by the industry. The Scottish Office Agriculture and Fisheries Department plays a key role in monitoring fish diseases. Environmental considerations are a vital part of the guidelines to be drawn up for the location and siting of marine fish-farming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to deal with the question whether planning powers could be extended to cover marine fish-farming. As the hon. Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) said, the planning remit of planning authorities does not extend below the low-water mark. Extending planning control to take in activities at sea raises fundamental problems concerning planning law generally and is not a subject that should be considered in isolation. I am aware of the arguments for extending the planning system to cover marine fish-farming developments, but the Scottish Office is not convinced that such an extension is necessary or appropriate. We continue to believe that the further development of the existing system in an evolutionary manner, through the development of the advisory committee and the locational guidelines, is the most appropriate way forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On three occasions the Minister has used the phrase "evolutionary manner", which he says that he has adopted from the Select Committee report. However, the report said not only that the Select Committee favoured an evolutionary approach, but that the advisory committee should be strengthened and that the local authority member should be given an effective right of veto. Furthermore, the report said that the committee
	<br><blockquote><p>"should also have a specific remit to take environmental factors into account".</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister confirm that the Government have rejected both suggestions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asks about the right of veto, and wants the Government to reconsider their position on the recommendation by the Select Committee that local authorities should have a right of veto on the question of fish-farms. We made the position clear in our response to the Select Committee. Paragraph 14 of the Select Committee's first report states our position. To summarise, we believe that giving a right of veto would undermine the role of the independent chairman of the committee and give the local authorities a stronger and more important role than other important interests. We therefore do not propose to change our position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that there might be two different cases? I suspect that the

	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
constitutency interests of my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) may be very different from mine. They are not mutually antagonistic, but my hon. Friend sets out the case in which he has expertise. Planning permission inland is a more difficult matter. In west Lothian, for example, other people are affected by planning permission. The case of Bowden Wells will have reached the Scottish Office. The difficulty there, in the Bathgate hills, relates to pollution problems from the fish-farms and their water supplies, and the possible effect on other farmers. The local authority must have powers of discretion. A fish-farmer may act on his own in the Western Isles or in sea lochs, but inland, other people are affected. That is why planning powers must be granted to local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We did make it clear. Inland freshwater fish-farming undoubtedly comes under the planning system because the ownership of land can be clearly determined. The title to the seabed, however, rests with the Crown.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are committed to marine conservation and to examining existing legislation to see how it could help meet longer-term conservation objectives in the marine environment. Scottish Office officials are considering the operation of the NCC's marine consultation area schemes in Scotland in the context of the current exercise to draw up locational guidelines for marine fish-farming. The Government will play a full part in ensuring that our marine environment is adequately safeguarded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Western Isles criticised the consultation arrangements. However, he failed to recognise the improvements that have been made, for example, more extensive consultation of local interests was introduced in 1986 by the Crown Estate commissioners. I understand that that has worked successfully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Arrangements already exist for consultations on offshore oil and gas developments. Those arrangements are specific to the oil and gas industry and are tailored to meet the varying requirements of individual marine areas. The arrangements ensure that bodies such as the Nature Conservancy Council for Scotland and fishing industry organisations are consulted and that any environmental impact from such developments is kept to a minimum. Therefore, additional provisions are not needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will that important Scottish Office study on marine consultation be made public or is it an internal departmental study? If it is to be made public, when are we likely to see it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The locational guidelines will be published. I believe in open government wherever it is possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can only describe the Minister's response as disappointing. In short, he said that everything is working splendidly, that there is no need for change and that the Crown Estate commissioners are wonderful. The Minister and the
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
Scottish Office are the only people who believe that. The folk on the ground regard the Crown Estate commissioners as nothing more than a nuisance when it comes to fish-farming, especially as their role in that has come about by historical accident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The marine estate was entirely neglected by the Crown Estate commissioners until fish-farming came along. Fish-farming still represents less than half of 1 per cent of Crown Estate turnover, but the Commissioners, who have no interest in a developmental role, are entrusted with the development of the fish-farming industry and all environmental matters relating to it. It is their decisions that count, but they frequently take the wrong ones. They rip off fish-farmers by taking rent to which they have no moral entitlement. They take money out of that hard-pressed industry, money which the Crown Estate does not need but which is needed by fish-farmers, and give nothing in return. Yet the Minister tells us that everything is fine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we propose in the amendments is not ideal, but at least SNH and local authorities would have a statutory input instead of just the Crown Estate commissioners. We are trying to put something together that would be welcomed by SNH, the fish-farming industry and local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister tells us that we cannot change the role of the Crown Estate commissioners through the Bill and I accept that. We must live with the absurd idea that the Crown owns the seabed. The Minister also told us that extending planning controls over inland waters raises fundamental problems—indeed it does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past 15 years fish-farming waters has become a significant industry. If there had been the slightest indication that those fundamental problems were being dealt with, we would not have to try to deal with them through the Bill. However an anomaly still exists. Developments that have a major economic, social and environmental impact on communities take place in sea lochs a few hundred yards from land. Local planning authorities and statutory environmental agencies have no right to help to decide whether such developments take place, or their scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are trying to address those difficulties, and assist SNH. In response, the Minister merely says that everything is working well, but no one else believes that. No one else believes that the advisory committee is anything more than a sham. That is shown by the Minister's reluctance to say how often it has met and how many cases it has considered. The establishment of the advisory committee was like drawing teeth. It was eventually set up, but, so far, its existence has proved irrelevant to existing problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our proposal is simple. The Minister does not want mechanisms that would give SNH a formal role in marine matters. However, the Bill should give that body a duty to make representations on marine issues, including fish-farming. That would upgrade the status of SNH, and would help to deal with the clear anomalies and unsatisfactory limbo that surrounds the fish-farming industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0033">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
I note also that the Minister did not refer to other marine issues such as mineral extraction and exploration and the conflict over the marina at Ballachulish. Such problems have also cropped up in other parts of the country. At Easter Ross the Crown Estate commissioners went off on their own merry way without telling anyone what they were doing, and cut across other development proposals. There should be greater openness and statutory involvement on other issues. We should recognise that the beds of sea lochs extend for up to three miles. They are merely an extension of land which, because of forces beyond the control of the committee, are covered by water rather than earth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our approach is sensible and the Minister should be more helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to clarify one point. The hon. Gentleman said that the Crown Estate commissioners have the sole decision-making role, but that is not strictly correct. River purification authorities and other statutory bodies have an enforcement role. We said in our memorandum to the Select Committee on Agriculture, for example, that river purification authorities should have a duty to issue licences for a discharge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry Bellingham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Norfolk, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the comments of the hon. Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson), I believe that the amendment is fairly modest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could understand the anxiety of my hon. Friend the Minister if the amendment gave a new tranche of powers to local authorities. However, the amendment would enhance the status of SNH in an important area. I shall have thought that that would appeal to my hon. Friend. It would not create a more bureaucratic procedure. We merely want to give that important new body a role in what is at the moment an area of limbo—to use the words of the hon. Member for Cunninghame, North.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may find that a great many people from different walks of life on the west coasts and in the Western Isles would be greatly sympathetic to the amendment. I do not know what discussions my hon. Friend has had with people representing farming, tourist, landowning and fishing interests, but the vast majority of them would be sympathetic to this modest proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister to be more robust; he should say to the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) that he is prepared to reconsider the matter and to table an amendment on Report that deals with it. If he were to say that, we could unite the Committee. It would be a great pity to remain divided about an issue on which basically, all agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's arguments relate to amendment No. 8. Certainly, SNH will be able to advise the Secretary of State on any matter that effects natural heritage. That will be dealt with under clause 2(1)(a), which will not preclude fish-farms or any other marine
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
development. If individual developments were listed in the Bill, that would remove SNH's flexibility to advise on any relevant matter. Some important issues might be admitted and other, as yet unknown, activities might be excluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
SNH will be notified of marine fish-farming developments in designated areas by Crown Estate commissioners, but the locational guidelines, on which the NCC and CCS advice is being sought, will clarify the position. I assure my hon. Friend that it is our intention that SNH should be notified of all proposed fish-farming developments, and as that will be covered in the locational guidelines, it does not need to be included specifically in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps you, Mr. Martin, can clarify that we cannot divide on the proposed new clause 2, as Divisions on proposed new clauses must wait until we have considered part I, but that we can divide on amendment No. 8.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can explain. Although the amendments are grouped together, we are debating amendment No. 35 only. We have grouped the proposed new clause 2 and amendment No. 8 with it because they deal with similar subjects.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall have to wait until we deal with clause 4 to vote on amendment No. 8.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the sense of the Under-Secretary's remarks on amendment No. 35. However, because of our grave dissatisfaction with what he said about fish-farming and the Government's response to the Select Committee on Agriculture's report, I should like to press amendment No. 35 to a vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are bashing our heads against a brick wall when we raise fish-farming with the Scottish Office. I am baffled and perplexed as to why it feels unable to consider even moderate and sensible changes to the Crown Estate commissioners' role in fish-farming development, and to provide for greater accountability and democratic input. I suppose, under the 25-year rule, we shall have to wait to read the Scottish Office files to find out the exact reasons for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am genuinely perplexed. I do not see what interest is served by allowing the present level of dissatisfaction to continue. I shall press the amendment to a Division.

	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed:</i> No. 1, in page 1, line 21, after "geological", insert "archaeological".—[	<i>Mr. Galbraith.</i>]</p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be a blessing in disguise, Mr. Martin, that, on account of your tyrannical ruling, my starred amendment No. 44 was overtaken by events. I sought in the amendment to insert the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"to conserve the archaeological and historical heritage of Scotland and to take account of human influences on the evolution of the Scottish landscape."</p></blockquote>
It might be a blessing in disguise because that will give Scottish Office Ministers an opportunity to reflect before Report and talk to their professional advisers about whether that wording is most felicitous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tabled the amendment because I understood that the agricultural section of the Scottish Office had, for years, taken seriously section 17(1) of the Agriculture Act 1986, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In discharging any functions connected with agriculture in relation to any land the Minister shall, so far as is consistent with the proper and efficient discharge of those functions, have regard to and endeavour to achieve a reasonable balance between the following considerations—
	<ol>
	<li>the promotion and maintenance of a stable and efficient agricultural industry;</li>
	<li>the economic and social interests of rural areas;</li>
	<li>the conservation and enhancement of the natural beauty and amenity of the countryside (including its flora and fauna and geological and physiographical features) and of any features of archaeological interest there; and</li>
	<li>the promotion of the enjoyment of the countryside by the public."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
The 1986 Act should be taken as a model for the Bill. Given the increasing importance of, and interest in, archaeology, which is known to the Committee, I hope that some account will be taken of the 1986 Act. Before the Minister comes to a conclusion against the form of words that I used in my starred amendment No. 44, I hope that he will consult his professional advisers in Brandon street.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have sympathy with much of what the hon. Gentleman said. I can give an undertaking to bring forward an amendment
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
to clause 3 as soon as possible, to cover archaeological and historical interests. That is the appropriate clause and the amendment should meet the hon. Gentleman's concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that we all are agreed on the significance and importance of Scotland's archaeological heritage. There is no dispute about man's effect on shaping Scotland's prehistoric landscape. I do not deny that the human activities represented on an archaeological site have had an impact on the natural heritage, as have many other activities represented by different types of artefacts. It is not right, however, to discuss this matter in this part of the Bill; it should come under clause 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
SNH will take full account of the needs of archaeology when discharging its functions. It will also inherit the valuable links that the NCC and the CCS have built up over the years with the various bodies that deal with archaeological matters, including the Historic Buildings and Monuments Directorate. Shortly to become Scottish Heritage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be inappropriate to include archaeology as one of the elements in the definition of Scotland's natural heritage. An archaeological site is not part of the natural heritage, but part of the country's built and cultural heritage; as such, it would be the odd one out if added to the list included in clause 1(3). To include the word "archaeological" would also confuse lines of responsibility between SNH and Scottish Heritage. At present there is no such problem and we intend that to continue. Given that assurance, I believe that the concerns expressed will effectively be met.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the builders of Skarra Brae would concur with the Minister's view. I do not dispute what he said, but I look forward to seeing what form of words he will use. The amendment was proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith). He may wish to withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sam Galbraith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Strathkelvin and Bearsden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 24, in page 1, line 23, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(4) For the purposes of this Act 'sustainable' means the preservation of biological diversity, the protection of natural ecosystems and the use of resources to satisfy current needs without jeopardising the interests of future generations and to do so both within and outwith the limitations of the natural history of the system involved.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment relates to the definition of the word "sustainable", a word that not only reoccurs within the Bill, but in relation to many aspects of the environment. I should say at the outset that I am not certain that we need a wider definition of that word. It is difficult to define it in its broadest sense and some important factors might be excluded from such a definition. Perhaps we should adopt a word whose definition could be developed over the years in relation to specific uses. I know that the Minister
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0035">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
partly shares that view. He quoted Wittgenstein on Second Reading who said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'Whereof one cannot speak, thereon one must remain silent.'"</p></blockquote>
I should point out that that was from Wittgenstein's "Tractatus Logico Philosophicus".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister will know, after a period as a primary-school teacher in the Alps, Wittgenstein realised that what he had written in the Tractatus was rubbish. I might add that he was also opposed to primary testing. Perhaps we should invoke Wittgenstein in support of our case, because he also changed his views as he developed his work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"natural resources must be managed in such a way that they can be handed on to our children and to our children's children."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 11 February 1991; Vol. 185, c. 701–702.]</p></blockquote>
That is part of the problem that we have in defining the word "sustainable". The Minister speaks of natural resources, not of the natural heritage. Similarly, the Brundtland report tends to use an economic definition, not necessarily a conservation or natural heritage definition. That report refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs".</p></blockquote>
Again, that smacks of economic sustainability, rather than sustainability of the environment and the natural heritage. Can the Minister assure us that the Government's view of sustainability is not limited to economic sustainability?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister can also clarify the Government's position on a matter with which his colleague, Lord Strathclyde, dealt in another place. Speaking about sustainability, Lord Strathclyde said that it would not be decided on a side-by-side basis, but according to a broad general view. I agree with that, but I seek an assurance that the existence of a similar site elsewhere will not be used as a reason for not sustaining a specific site. I do not mean SSSIs only, but even areas outwith that designation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I should like to explain the last part of the amendment, in the hope that I shall receive a reassurance about that, too. The amendment ends with the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"to do so both within and outwith the limitations of the natural history of the system involved."</p></blockquote>
That relates to a matter that was raised in another place. An example of such a system is hedgerows. They are probably not sustainable in the long term unless they are self-regenerating. In other words, they have a natural life history, which will probably bring them to an end. I seek an assurance that the natural history of a system that will not be sustainable for ever will not be used as a reason for failing to ensure sustainability within the time span available to that natural system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment raises the question of sustainability and resources. I refer to a letter sent on 23 January 1991 to the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and copied to the Scottish Office. The letter was from Steve Berry of the trade union side of the Nature Conservancy Council in Peterborough. It begins,
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Dear Mr. Trippier</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Thank you for your letter of 17 January."</p></blockquote>
The letter is against a background of correspondence. It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On the question of resources for the new agencies, one can argue indefinitely about whether these will or will not prove to be 'adequate for their tasks' since everything depends on the interpretation placed on the meaning of that phrase. We have always thought it reasonable that the new bodies should, as a minimum, be able to carry out their statutory responsibilities. The PE Inbucon report last May estimated that to execute the nature conservation element of those responsiblities, a minimum of £66m was required. The aggregate budget of the CCW, NCC(S) and NCC(E)—excluding the £2.45m which has been, as it were, inherited from the Countryside Commission—is around £63.4m, some £2.5m short of 'adequacy'."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I bow to the Chair.

	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, the debate goes to the root of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) that sustainability is a general concept, which relates to social, economic and environmental aspects in general. I was interested in his attempt to define the word "sustainable". He will know that that point was discussed extensively at various stages of the Bill in another place. We are mindful of the need for that concept to be properly understood by all concerned. There is no doubt that the concept of sustainability is vital to setting up SNH. We recognise the definition proposed as being related to the World Conservation strategy. The underlying thinking, therefore, fits in with the Government's policy and was set out in our consultation paper, "Scotland's Natural Heritage: the Way Ahead".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a general disadvantage to statutory definitions because they are unchangeable until a further opportunity for legislation on the subject comes along. By including that definition in statute we could, unwittingly, be restricting Scottish Natural Heritage. Circumstances can change, and while the definition might seem satisfactory to us now, that may not always be so. Indeed, David Pearce in his book "The Blueprint for a Green Economy" quotes some 20 different experts' views on the definitions of sustainability and sustainable development. Although I admire the courage of the hon. Gentleman in proposing such a definition, I believe that it would not be wise for the Committee to accept a definition of any sort. It is important to establish a consensus on what is meant by sustainable, but that consensus will undoubtedly evolve over time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0036">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
Unfortunately, the amendment confuses a definition with an explanation. We do not regard its definition of "sustainable" as entirely accurate or appropriate. The term
	<br><blockquote><p>"the preservation of biological diversity"</p></blockquote>
is already contained within SNH's general aim under clause 1(1)(a) on the conservation of the flora and fauna of Scotland. Furthermore, the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"the protection of natural ecosystems"</p></blockquote>
is an integral part of the practice of conserving and enhancing the natural heritage. Therefore, it is neither appropriate nor necessary to include those concepts in the definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The latter part of the amendment may have some merit. It goes some way towards explaining what we mean by "sustainable", without defining it. However, the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"both within and outwith the limitations of the natural history of the system involved"</p></blockquote>
is somewhat cumbersome and, if I may say so, it would not be readily intelligible to constituents. There is a problem with definitions generally. It is often difficult to define complex matters for the purposes of legislation in terms that mean something useful to ordinary people. The definition contained in the amendment falls into that trap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, the Scottish Office wishes to establish the environmentally sensitive use and management of our natural resources. We also seek viable economic activity and an increase in the standard of the quality of life. Those two objectives are not separate; they are indivisible. Economic activity, which degrades the natural resource base to such an extent that the activity cannot be sustained in the long term undermines our future and the future of succeeding generations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the concept itself, I wish to quote from the second draft of "Caring for the World—A Strategy for Sustainability", which is an update of the World Conservation strategy. Eight principles are set out in the report and I hope that hon. Members will bear with me while I refer briefly to them and put them in the context of Scotland's natural heritage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first principle is to limit human impact on the biosphere to a level that is within its carrying capacity. That is a crucial but technically difficult issue. We hope and expect SNH to stimulate fundamental research on the carrying capacity of, for example, land for food and timber production, and for recreational pursuits so that it can advise on how the management of uses and activities can be made sustainable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second principle is to maintain the earth's stock of biological wealth. I am sure that members of the Committee will recognise that it will be SNH's duty to conserve and enhance the flora and fauna by protecting endangered species and safeguarding wildlife habitats. The third principle is the use of non-renewable resources at rates that do not exceed the creation of renewable substitutes. There is frequent criticism that sustainability cannot be applied to non-renewable resources, but the principle seeks to place that in the context of technological development. I am sure that the Committee will
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
know of many examples of the use of renewable substitutes in Scotland, for example, in the production of electricity from water and wind energy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fourth principle aims for an equal distribution of the benefits and costs of resource use and environmental management among and within countries. That is a difficult principle to put into practice but, focusing on Scotland, consideration is being given by many different interests to various pricing mechanisms. To promote technologies that increase the benefits from the given stock of resources is the fifth principle. There is ample practical evidence of that already in Scotland. For example, there is increased extraction of hydrocarbons from North sea reservoirs as a result of technological advance, and much further research is being undertaken in that and in similar areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sixth principle is to use economic policy to help maintain natural wealth. Again, there are several examples of that, and other policy instruments are being developed, such as assistance schemes for the maintenance of woodlands and forests, the development of extensification and set-aside schemes. At a more theoretical level, a great deal of research is being done into methods of economic valuation of new activities to ensure that environmental costs and benefits are built into the assessment of new developments. To adopt an anticipatory cross-sectoral approach to decision-making is the seventh principle. That lies at the heart of the Government's philosophy as set out in the White Paper on the environment. Finally, the eighth principle is to promote and support cultural values that are compatible with sustainability. We recognise the importance of a major public education process about the environment as a whole, especially its sustainable use.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government have defined various difficult concepts and included legal definitions in previous Bills. Why are they now shying clear of a definition of "sustainability"? Is the Minister saying that it is impossible to define that concept or is he arguing that such a definition is undesirable? The concept of sustainability is at the heart of the Bill, yet the Minister is saying that SNH will have a duty to ensure that actions are undertaken in a sustainable manner, without defining what is meant by sustainable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is general support in the House for the principle of sustainability. At least 20 definitions of that concept are mentioned in the book to which I referred earlier. If a specific definition is accepted, SNH could be restricted in future when conditions might change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to stress the importance of environmental education. We expect the environmental education working party established by the Secretary of State to lead the way on that issue and for SNH to take up its recommendations and put them into practice. I hope that, as a result of my explanation, members of the Committee will be clear about sustainability and that they will recognise that to put a cryptic definition

	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
of an evolving concept into the Bill would be impracticable and unjustifiable. The amendment is a good attempt to define the concept, but it would be unsafe for us to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. He applied some strictures to my amendment and said that it dealt with an explanation, not a definition. I am not sure that there is much difference between the two. Nor are they necessarily mutually exclusive. A cup can be defined as a vessel, which holds liquid and from which liquid can be drunk. That is both a definition and an explanation of its use. The Minister tried to define sustainability by providing an explanation of it. I am sure that his constituents will be interested to hear that he thinks them so dumb that they cannot understand my definition. That does not show a very high regard for the intelligence of the constituents in Edinburgh, West. I am sure that we will want to let them know about that. However, I am grateful for the Minister's extensive definition and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>CONSTITUTION AND PROCEEDINGS OF SCOTTISH NATURAL HERITAGE</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 52, in page 20, line 15, leave out paragraphs 3 and 4 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"3. SNH shall consist of twelve members appointed by the Secretary of State as follows—
	<ol>
	<li>four after consultation with bodies and persons appearing to him to represent nature conservation and amenity interests;</li>
	<li>four after consultation with bodies and persons appearing to him to represent farming, forestry and landowning interests; and</li>
	<li>four after consultation with other bodies and persons as he considers appropriate.".</li></ol></p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take the following amendments: No. 19, in page 20, line 15, leave out from "be" to end of line and insert "twenty".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No. 17, in page 20, line 16, at end add
	<br><blockquote><p>"; and before making any appointments, the Secretary of State shall consult widely with all interested parties.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful that the amendments have been grouped together. They are different, but contain the same principle about the membership of SNH. There is no great dispute between the Government and the Opposition on the matter. We are dealing with membership numbers and the method of consultation. Amendment No. 52 would change the number of members from eight to 12. I shall speak to that amendment first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Eight members will be too few. I originally thought that the body would consist of four regional chairmen and their deputies. That would make eight, which would exclude anyone else. That would be totally
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
unsatisfactory, which is why I have tabled an amendment to increase the number to 20. I now understand that the four regional chairmen—without their deputies—will be members. That eases the position slightly, but if the membership remains at eight, the Secretary of State will have discretion over the appointment of four members only, which is too few. I should like the Minister to drop the reference to eight members and accept our proposal of 12. As only four places will be occupied by the regional chairmen, that would leave eight places to be filled at the discretion of the Secretary of State. Will the Minister give an assurance about that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other amendments deal with consultation about who may be on SNH. Schedule 1(4) provides that in making appointments the Secretary of State shall have regard to the desirability of ensuring that the membership contains people of knowledge or experience. It would also be beneficial if he had a duty to consult widely with interested parties. The person chosen by the Secretary of State to represent the Ramblers Association, the Scottish Ski Club, the RSPB and so on, might not be the person whom they would choose. I do not say that the people chosen should be delegates or nominees of those bodies—that would be constrictive and there must be freedom. However, the Secretary of State should have a duty to consult with such bodies before making appointments. When my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) is Secretary of State he will ensure that there is a broad range of members on the body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 52 would ensure that four members represented nature conservation and amenity interests; four represented farming and forestry; and that the Secretary of State had leeway to choose the other four. The amendments would provide a package which would allow an examination of the structure and membership of the SNH. The low limit of eight members should be increased to 12 and there should be wide consultation, which takes into account the view of a variety of bodies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Have the Government contacted the administrator of the Scottish Ornithologists Club, Mr. M. H. Murphy of 21 Regent terrace, Edinburgh? Will the club be included and consulted? The Scottish Office will have received letters from Nigel Doar, who is the campaign co-ordinator of the Scottish Wildlife Trust and from others in the trust. Will it have a place on SNH?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) that there will be 12 appointments and we envisage that they will all be taken up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that assurance. Will the Government seek to delete the reference to eight within the schedule?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The difficulty is that we have consulted on that and of all the 156 responses only two suggested that a maximum
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0038">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
membership of eight would be insufficient and others thought that there should be a membership of eight to 12. We thought that the schedule would give extra flexibility. It is our intention that all 12 should be appointed. The figure of eight was included largely because of the consultations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that SNH should cover a wide range of interests and geographical areas and that they should be adequately represented within its membership. I do not agree that what we have proposed cannot accommodate all the most important aspects of the interests whose voices should be heard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should bear in mind that a member of SNH will not represent a particular constituency. I expect that most of those appointed will have adequate knowledge that extends beyond their specialism. It will be important to appoint people who closely fit that description to enable all relevant interests to be represented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister spoke of all relevant interests. Are we in a position to tell David Minns of the RSPB and the Scottish Ornithologists Club that they will be properly represented by someone who will be acceptable to them? I understand that not everyone can be represented, as the board would become enormous and unwieldy, but certain important interests should be properly represented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is uncertainty about those who should be consulted. That is the technical problem presented by amendment No. 17. That amendment would lay the Secretary of State open to the objection that he had not consulted every organisation or body that, according to an objector, should have been consulted. That could be used to challenge the validity of any appointment that the Secretary of State might make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We decided not to include such a provision in the Bill, but I can assure hon. Members that the Secretary of State will consult appropriate bodies and organisations before he makes any appointment to SNH, or fills any vacancy on its board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can we have a specific undertaking that the Scottish Ornithologists Club, the RSPB and the Scottish Wildlife Trust at least will be consulted before appointments are made?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We will consult widely. I do not want to give a hard commitment on individual bodies, as then I would be expected to spell out a list of them. I accept the principle of the hon. Gentleman's remarks that it is important that a complete cross section should be appointed and that major interests should be represented. I take that firmly on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State will consider nominations that are made to him. I recommend interested bodies to write in. It is our intention to have the highest quality of members on SNH. As I have said, the Secretary of State will consult widely to fulfil that intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is helpful. In other words, we can say that all those bodies have an obligation, if they feel strongly enough, to write in. What will be the time span for writing in? Would it be reasonable to ask them to do so within a fortnight?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly before the summer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As soon as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is legally difficult to give the commitment for which the hon. Gentleman asked earlier. To give a specific undertaking about a particular body, but not others, would fetter the Secretary of State's discretion, leaving appointments open to judicial review. I am advised on those legal grounds that such a proposal would be unwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot guarantee that particular interests will be represented on the board, although obviously we shall want a cross section. We gave a commitment in our consultation paper, "Scotland's Natural Heritage: The Way Ahead" that the Secretary of State would consult relevant bodies before making appointments. We wish the views of many to be considered when selecting candidates for membership of SNH, but further consideration on the practical difficulties associated with such a commitment has meant that that would not sit properly in statute. However, I give a firm assurance that the fullest possible consultation will be undertaken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 19 would ensure that there was a fixed number on the board, without the possibility of its being varied. We set considerable store by the flexibility incorporated in the potential membership of SNH. After a few years SNH may find that a change in the number of members would be desirable. The Bill as it stands can cope easily with those variations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have answered many of the points that have been made. With regard to the regional board, we intend SNH to be an accountable organisation with a network of local officers. To support this network and to facilitate contact with local people, SNH will have a structure of regional boards throughout Scotland, in addition to the main board of eight to 12 members. The boards will be developed from those that operate as part of the Nature Conservancy Council for Scotland in the coming year. The NCC will have four boards—one for each of its regions with about 12 members each. That will mean that 48 other people will have a direct and legitimate say in the affairs of the NCC, in addition to those on the main board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will see that as a significant broadening of the input into the NCC and recognise that that goes further than amendment No. 19, while still maintaining a sensible size for the workings of the main board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As Mr. Brian Walden often says, I want to be quite clear that I have got this right. I think that the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr.

	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
Welsh) is in the same position as me when I say that I was ignorant of there being any question of judicial review. Despite being a Member of Parliament for 28 years, I had no notion that Governments could be taken to court if they said that they would consult some bodies but not others. That is a new doctrine to me, so I must ensure that I understand fully. If the Minister were to give an undertaking to, say, the RSPB, the Scottish Ornithologists Club or the Scottish Wildlife Trust that it would be consulted, could other bodies take the Scottish Office through the Court of Session?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is the legal advice that I have made clear to the Committee. I have a high regard for the bodies that the hon. Gentleman mentioned and any such interested bodies are recommended to write in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Forgive my curiosity, but did the Minister, who is a lawyer, know about that before this morning?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Lawyers know where to look up the law—they do not carry it round in their heads.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised at the Minister's reasons for rejecting amendment No. 17. It seems a broad measure to ask the Secretary of State to consult all interested parties. The idea that it could lead to judicial review if, for example, the Possill park birdwatchers society had not been consulted amazes me. That will give the health service lots of ammunition. The Minister knows that it consults widely, but I do not think that there has ever been a judicial review because, for example, the Dumfries and Galloway Erythrema Association was not consulted. We have been given ideas for future activity. The Minister's argument against the amendment is weak, but I am grateful for his absolute assurance that the number will be 12 and that there will be wide consultation. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 18, in page 20, line 23, after "interest", insert ", including ownership of land,".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment was tabled to try to achieve clarification as there seems to be a contradiction. Paragraph 5(a) states that the Secretary of State shall satisfy himself
	<br><blockquote><p>"before he appoints a person to be a member that the person will have no such financial or other interest".</p></blockquote>
Is a landowner considered to have a financial or other interest in the natural conservation of the land and, as such, will he be excluded from membership of SNH? Would the noble Lord Thurso be allowed to be a member of SNH?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should tell the Committee that there is no need for the amendment. The provision, as drafted, is adequate for the
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
purposes for which it is intended. Obviously, we must ensure the absence of any prejudicial interest of board members of SNH, and I am sure that we are in full agreement about that. That will undoubtedly be the position under the provision that has been drafted. Paragraph 5 states that a "financial or other interest" that might be prejudicial to someone being a satisfactory member of SNH should be considered by the Secretary of State when the person is a candidate for membership. The interpretation of "other interest" covers ownership of land that might affect someone's performance as a member of SNH.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about Lord Thurso?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not appropriate for me to mention individual names. There is no need to single out ownership of land as an example of a type of interest which would be relevant. There might be other interests that would be relevant. I trust that the hon. Gentleman would not suggest that the ownership of land in itself would automatically have a detrimental effect on an individual's performance as a member of SNH. Indeed, without proper stewardship of the land by owners and users, SNH would not be able to achieve its aims and purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Individuals whose ownership of land conserves and enhances the natural heritage of that land and helps to encourage understanding and enjoyment of the area could be ideal candidates for membership of SNH. Knowledge of the way in which land is properly managed by those who earn a living from it could be an important factor to be represented on SNH, just as knowledge of the conservation of species and habitats or the workings of ecosystems will be. By setting up SNH, we aim to bring together all the elements of knowledge of the management of our natural heritage to ensure that SNH takes the most rounded view of its responsibilities and of its main aims and purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee can be assured that the Secretary of State will pay the most careful attantion to that provision before making any appointments to the board. The Secretary of State must also review the position from time to time, and hon. Members can be assured that any change in an individual member's interests will also be taken into account. To fulfil that duty, the Secretary of State will naturally take the broadest view of the type of interest to be taken into account under the heading of other interests likely to affect prejudicially the performance of a member's functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of my explanation and the assurance about how the Secretary of State will discharge his duties, I trust that the hon. Gentleman will not press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) raised an important point with, which the Minister has not dealt. If someone owns land that could potentially
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0040">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
be designated as a site of special scientific interest, there is instantly a prospect of a serious clash of interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend referred to Lord Thurso. We are not talking about sweeties—Lord Thurso picked up £400,000 for not planting trees. That reminds me of a story in "Catch-22", where Major-Major's father was paid for not growing alfalfa. The more alfalfa he did not grow, the more he was paid. That is exactly what happened. If people have desisted from planting trees in a stretch of boggy ground—for several centuries but the land is suddenly designated as an SSSI—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Any criticism of a member of the other House must be made on a substantive motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will bear that in mind, but I was not criticising—I was describing the circumstances in which Lord Thurso picked up £400,000. That sort of money is available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The landowning lobby is desperately opposed to SSSI's, but others would be only too pleased to have their land so designated so that they could enter into management agreements. It would be a sensible precaution to remove that clash which, I am sure, no member of the House of Lords would wilfully enter into, but which might arise as a result of his appointment to the board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most dissatisfied with the Minister's reply. Paragraph 5(a) states that a person should have no financial interest. A landowner must, by definition, have a "financial" interest in his land. By definition, therefore, he or she must be excluded from the board. The Minister spoke of a person's satsifactory membership of the board and conduct of affairs. What "satisfactory" means is vague and will be open to fudicial review. Ownership of tracts of land that are designated as SSSI's would certainly be prejudicial to membership of SNH.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister cannot simply shake that off. I agree that we should not mention specific groups, but the word "financial" appears in schedule 1. Once one gets into the specifics of finance, one is talking of the specifics of landowners. Although it may be open to judicial review, I understand that a landowner must be excluded from the board of SNH.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that a landowner's interest in the land may create a conflict of interest with his membership of SNH. That is a good example of why the provision is so widely worded. The most likely circumstances to arise are when a landowning member of SNH could be offered a management agreement by SNH. Clearly, considerable sums could be involved. The Secretary of State would certainly consider that carefully. Paragraph 5 allows the Secretary of State to take account of that both before an appointment and once an appointment has been made. The essential question is whether the interest is such as prejudicially to affect the performance of a member's functions on the board of SNH.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
When a particular case in which a member of the board has a material interest comes before the board for decision, as a matter of course that member must declare his interest and withdraw from further discussion on the matter. Those procedures will be reflected in the notes on guidance to be issued to all SNH board members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that that system is used widely when people have financial or other interests to declare. But we are talking about one of the major functions of SNH—the conservation and, preservation of the land. It is not a side issue that will crop up only once in every five years, when the noble Lord whatever-his-name-is suddenly finds that a wee part of his peat bog has become an SSSI. This is a major issue which will crop up at every meeting of SNH. That is why who sits on the board is so important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister discussed whether these interests would be prejudicial. But who is to say that they are prejudicial? They might not be prejudicial to the board member. The Minister has opened a can of worms. Once he lets a landowner onto the board, the SNH will be strewn with judicial reviews.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Ray Michie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll and Bute)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is not only noble Lords who own land?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, absolutely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Land ownership is not a side issue. Conservation of the land is probably the heart of the Bill. Once the owners of that land are sitting on the board, there will be a serious conflict of interest that will often be financial, in direct contradiction of paragraph 5(a).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that an SSSI might not belong to an individual, but to his pal? Membership of the Scottish Landowners Federation, a generic group of people who have a shared interest, might make a person unsuitable because of his vested interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree. I do not wish to make a hostile attack on members of the Scottish Landowners Federation. My hon. Friend may remember that I was complimentary about landowners last Tuesday, when I spoke about the access that they give and the excellent system that prevails in Scotland. I feel no hostility, but the wording of the Bill creates a direct contradiction. Unless that is resolved, the Minister will have laid bare a can of worms. That may be a slightly mixed metaphor, but I am sure that the Minister understands what I mean.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of what my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) has said, it may help the Committee if the Minister revealed precisely what was said to Mr. Charles Clover, who reports on page 8 of 	<i>The Daily Telegraph</i> today. Did Mr. Clover receive guidance from the Scottish Office or was there a ministerial interview?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I shall read the article with great care, but it does not arise from recent conversations with the Scottish Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have laid out clearly the procedures and safeguards that are written into the system. No group of people should be told that none of their number can be appointed. For example, it would be wrong to say that no farmers could be appointed because a farmer might have an interest. My hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro) was a member of the NCC board. He has been an excellent member and has given unstintingly of his time, advice and service, and there has never been a problem. It would be a pity if whole groups of people were excluded. The rules and safeguards have been specifically framed so that if there were a conflict of interest, it would have no harmful consequences. The rules should be followed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Ray Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 28 in page 21, line 15, at end insert—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>"Consultative Council</i></p>
	<p>9A A Scottish Natural Heritage Consultative Council shall be established to advise SNH on the exercise and perfomance of its functions. The members of the Council shall be—
	<ol>
	<li>not less than twenty-five, nor more than thirty four persons appointed by SNH</li>
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
	<li>representative of local authority and community interests and of such other interested bodies as SNH consider appropriate.".</li></ol></p>
	<p>I tabled the amendment because there is a need for a consultative council to help and advise Scottish Natural Heritage in the exercise of its functions. Ideas, critisisms and the views of all people should be presented to SNH. I should like the composition of such an advisory council to represent community interests, especially those of local authorities. I am always worried about a non-elected organisation that has a great deal of power. It is important that an advisory council is established that comprises some democratically-elected members who take an interest in what SNH is doing.</p>
	<p>The council could include in its membership some members of Highlands and Islands Enterprise and chairmen of local enterprise companies. Perhaps people who represent ramblers, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, ornithologists and so on could be members too, so that their needs could be take into account. SNH will cover a large area and it will have an enormous job to do. It would benefit from the advice and help of members of local authorities especially, and others who are truly aware of and sensitive to the needs of the area and local communities.</p>
	<p>I am not clear whether the recently appointed members of the Nature Conservancy Council for Scotland will be members of SNH. I imagine that several of them will. I have read the list of members of the council. I am sure that they are eridute people, but I could not see a crofter, for example, on the list. I should be interested to hear the Minister's response to the amendment.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs Michie) for tabling the amendment. I recognise the good intentions behind the proposal in that the hon. Lady wishes to ensure that Scottish Natural Heritage is accountable to local people for its actions and responsive to their needs and wishes. Members of the Committee will know that, throughout the process of consultation on the establishment of SNH, we have made clear the importance of discussions with the widest possible range of local and other interests. I am sure that those are the motivations behind the hon. Lady moving the amendment. The structure that she proposes for her consultative council would, however, be ineffective and inefficient. It does not take into account the provisions that are already in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked whether elected members of local authorities could be members of the advisory committee. There is no reason why Scottish Natural Heritage should not appoint local authority elected members to regional boards, as has happened on the regional boards of the Nature Conservancy Council for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We intend, by the provisions of paragraph 16 of schedule 1, that SNH should establish committees as it sees fit. Some of those committees, like regional boards, will carry out the executive functions of SNH at a local level. Others could operate in an advisory
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0042">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
capacity. There is no restriction in the Bill on the type of person eligible to become a member of such a committee. Obviously, it would include anyone with an interest in the work and would be likely to include local authority and local communities' representatives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister goes further, can he give us some idea of how many times a year SNH is likely to meet? Its composition will depend on who is available. Will it meet once a month, once a quarter or twice a year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I envisage SNH meeting once a month, but it will be up to its members to decide. They may want to meet more frequently in emergencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The formal structure proposed by the hon. Lady for a consultative council is not, I believe, appropriate. With the advice given to it by local committees and regional boards, SNH will be fully aware of the views of local interests. Because the main board of SNH will comprise people with knowledge or experience relevant to its principal areas of activity, it would be reasonable to assume that the local committees would be in its image and that members would have local knowledge and experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would not be appropriate for the main board to be overseen by such a consultative council. Such councils have proved rather ineffective, and we have an opportunity for much more effective decision-making and consultative procedures under paragraph 16. The bureaucratic procedures that might be involved in the relationship between the main body and its consultative council would not, I believe, be efficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The flexibility that I have just outlined will undoubtedly prove a great deal more effective in the long term. We should place greater responsibility for local issues on the main board of SNH than the amendment implies, and for that reason I consider the amendment undesirable. I do not consider it appropriate to set up a new body and to have another council overseeing its activities from the outset. That does not imply a great deal of confidence in the new body. It would not get us off on the right foot for what we believe is an important step towards developing better relations between those involved in conservation and those who live in rural areas and look after our natural heritage. The local committees that are to be set up will play an extremely important role and will meet the general aims that the hon. Lady has in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Ray Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for explaining the composition of the regional boards and for his hope that they will reflect the composition of SNH. I hope, however, that the regional boards will not reflect solely SNH, because people other than scientists and landowners will have a great interest in its activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that advisory and consultative councils have not always worked well, but I disagree. The consultative council of the Highlands and Islands
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
development board, which is about to disappear, worked well, but I accept the Minister's assurances that there will be local representation and input, particularly from elected members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Lady so readily accepts the Minister's assurances, perhaps she should press him further. The hon. Lady wanted local authority representation. The Minister says that the regional boards will have the power to invite local authority participation, but they have no statutory basis. The regional board system could disappear, but the Minister assumes that there will be regional boards and that they will allow the representation that the hon. Lady rightly seeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for pressing the Minister. We have quangos all over the place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady wants another one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I refute that. It would not be a quango. It would be an advisory council and it would have elected members, which is important. I am not completely reassured by the Under-Secretary, but I accept what he has said. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 53, in page 23, line 22, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(4) A document executed by SNH shall not be withheld from inspection by any person unless—
	<ol>
	<li>public awareness of the information contained in that document could prejudice the conservation of the natural heritage; or</li>
	<li>that document contains information volunteered to SNH in confidence by any person; or</li>
	<li>that document contains information, the release of which could prejudice a commercial undertaking; or</li>
	<li>that document refers, or is in response to any matter which a government department or public body has requested to be kept confidential; or</li>
	<li>that document relates to the development of any policy by SNH.".</li></ol></p></blockquote>
The amendment would give the general public access to documents executed by SNH. It is modelled on a European Community directive on freedom of environmental information, which should be implemented in 1992. Perhaps the Minister will say something about the status of that directive and whether the Government will implement it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The directive was the subject of a report by the House of Lords European Communities Committee, which discussed freedom of access to environmental information. That Committee commended the moves throughout the EC to provide greater public access to such information. Access is increasingly available when local authorities become involved in agreements with other bodies on environmental matters. My amendment would ensure that the SHN comes under a similar obligation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although there is an increasing awareness in the EC of the need to make such information public
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0043">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
there are still different requirements in the various states. I should like Britain to be among the leaders in making such information public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 58 of the House of Lords European Communities Committee report suggested that
	<br><blockquote><p>"legal agreements, such as management agreements"</p></blockquote>
should come under the scope of freedom of environmental information. That is relevant to the SNH, because it will carry out many of its tasks that effect nature reserves or SSSIs through various management agreements with other bodies or individuals. Some of those agreements can be costly to the public purse. My hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) referred to the scale of some of those agreements when dealing with landowning interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NCC's most recent report describes management agreements that have been struck during the past year, some of which involve considerable sums. For example, the report lists a management agreement in Strathclyde for some 700 hectares of heathland that involved a lump sum payment of £90,000. We do not know whether that individual or company kept to its obligations under that agreement. We cannot know because we do not know the content of the agreement. In Grampian region an agreement was listed for 90 hectares affecting open water—presumably a lock. That involved a lump sum payment of £70,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not all management agreements involve such lump sum payments—some involve annual payments. One case listed in the 16th report involves heathland in the Orkneys, for which the annual payment is more than £14,000. Those are considerable sums. I understand that the running total for the NCC on management agreements in Scotland is about £1.5 million a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
1.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be helpful to the work of the SNH, and correct in principle, if the public had access to details of agreements covering SSSIs, nature reserves and grant aids paid out by the new agency. The public could thereby be sure that their money was being used in a properly accountable way. The amendment would ensure that all documents relevant to such agreements were accessible to the public. It would include safeguards for documents that could remain confidential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (4)(a) of the amendment includes a safeguard to withhold a document if public awareness of information contained in a document could prejudice the conservation of the natural heritage. Some of the agency's information might best be kept private. For example, perhaps information about breeding grounds or rare birds' nests should remain confidential to avoid interference from the public. The amendment would allow such information to remain confidential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Commercially sensitive information could also remain confidential if my amendment were accepted. The NCC often uses that as an excuse for keeping most of its management agreements confidential. If
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
the Bill specified appropriate grounds it would put a constraint on the SNH's ability to claim that any old agreement was commercially confidential. An agreement should be confidential if a competitor could use knowledge of it to the disadvantage of the party that struck it. However, most management agreements between private landowners struck by the new agency will not be commercially sensitive in that way. There would be no competitors for the Earl of Thurso to fear if he undertook forestry planting. He need not be apprehensive of information about a management agreement becoming publicly available, because it would not place him at an unreasonable competitive disadvantage. Although I included in the amendment the provision that commercially confidential agreements should be kept confidential, I believe that that would apply to only a few agreements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would establish a passive right. SNH would not be obliged to publicise the details of all documents, with the exception of those outlined in my amendment. It would not be required to act in such a positive way. The provision would require SNH to disclose details of management agreements when a member of the public requests them from the office of the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, certain documents affecting nature reserve agreements are kept in the Register of Sasines in Edinburgh. That register is not accessible to many people. If the Government are genuinely serious about decentralising the new agency and giving it a regional focus, members of the public should be able to obtain details of management agreements from their local offices and not have to go to the Register of Sasines. Such information should be locally available in the regional centres of the new agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle embodied in my amendment is reasonable. It would be good for SNH and would inspire public confidence in it. As a result of the new EC directive, the Government will have to accept that principle anyway. I hope that that they will respond positively to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) asked about the directive on environmental information. I understand that consultation is now taking place on the directive's proposals. We shall take a keen interest in that process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I sympathise with the hon. Gentleman's desire to make the work of SNH accessible to the public, his amendment goes much too far. It would apply to any document executed by SNH. It would allow a member of the public to demand to see any letters signed on behalf of SNH dealing with any subject, even personnel matters, unless they came within one of the exempted categories. It could even cover internal memos on behalf of SNH to any of its staff. That cannot be desirable. In any event, we are satisfied that the Bill already contains adequate provision to ensure that the public are kept informed about SNH's activities. SNH is required by clause 9 to submit an annual report to the Secretary of State on the exercise and performance of its functions. That report will be laid before Parliament—a copy
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0044">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
will be placed in the Library—and will be available to the public in the same way as the annual reports of the NCC and CCS are at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the annual report would be made available in the same way as the annual reports of the CC and the NCC are. The CCS publishes details of its management agreements in a much fuller form than the NCC. In the past, the two organisations have followed different practices in that regard. I hope that the practice that will be followed by the SNH in providing details of management agreements will be the more open of the previous two practices—more along the lines of the CC's.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman that we should be as open as possible in those matters. I expect that the practice of the Countryside Commission for Scotland will be followed in future by the new body. Under clause 2(1)(b), SNH will have a general power to provide advice and disseminate
	<br><blockquote><p>"knowledge to any persons … about the natural heritage … and any matters arising from the discharge of its function."</p></blockquote>
I would expect SNH to be more than willing to cooperate with any requests from individuals about particular aspects of its work, provided that that did not disclose confidential or particularly sensitive information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that SNH will wish to operate as openly as possible, if it wants to attract public support and confidence. I do not see that a statutory duty allowing public inspection of SNH documents would be helpful. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government will have to tackle the issue in greater depth when the process of consultation on the EC directive is completed and it is implemented. I take heart from the Minister's remarks about the openness that he expects from the new agency and I am especially interested in his comments that the best practice of the Countryside Commission of Scotland will be followed by the new agency. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule be the First schedule to the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have the impression that now is the time to raise the question of money and resources. Am I right about that, Mr. Martin?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Staff resources, but not money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer to a letter of 23 January from the NCC to the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, paragraph 2 of which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As far as staffing is concerned, it is perfectly true—as you say—that the figures in the table appended to my letter to the Secretary of State excluded those LPA (now called FTA by the way) staff who would block permanent posts. There was however nothing sinister or deceptive about this. They also exclude for that matter
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
numbers of permanent staff blocking FTA posts. Far from seeking 'to imply that far more vacancies exist than is or will be the case in reality', I was simply drawing necessary attention to the inescapable, unchallengeable and indeed unchallenged fact that the new agencies—especially in Wales and Scotland—are severely understaffed now and will be so for some considerable time. You may find this uncomfortable just as we find it regrettable but little purpose will be served by attempting to disguise either the problem itself or its dimensions."</p></blockquote>
Mr. Berry is writing officially on behalf of the NCC and I am sure that the letter is in the public domain, so it is not confidential. It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The difficulties confronting the JNCC, too, are not diminished by talk of its having made 'an excellent start'. The TUS, incidentally, did not wait for your prompting to welcome Dr O'Connor's appointment to the post of Chief Officer but wrote to congratulate him within a few hours of the news being released. While we cannot speak for those in high authority in the NCC(s), all the NCC staff are keen to see the JNCC establish itself quickly. Not surprisingly perhaps there is as yet little evidence of its progress. Its structure is not yet finally settled, its future location is still uncertain, its staff have neither work programmes nor job descriptions, almost one third of its posts are unfilled and it faces such severe financial restraints in its first year of operation that it may only be able to continue existing research programmes rather than undertake anything new. In addition, it clearly has a quite inadequate level of administrative support staff, may not have sufficient funds to fill its allocation of 51 permanent posts and because of its dependance for its budget on the three 'parent' bodies will have to produce at least rough estimates for its expenditure in 1992/3 by April of this year. The Committee is also of course impeded by the failure of this Government to accept one of the crucial recommendations of Lord Carver's report viz that it should have the final authority to determine the extent of its own area of responsibility in the event of disputes about what constitutes a GB matter (para 4.16 of the report refers).</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The Government, you will not perhaps need reminding, regarded this provision as 'unnecessary', a judgement which we fear may prove to be not very far-sighted.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The JNCC staff and no doubt, most anyway, of its appointed members will do everything in their power to overcome these obstacles but their task will not be assisted by complacency in any quarter.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I come finally to the issue of future Government policy on nature conservation, a rather large subject, but dealt with rather sparingly by three lines of your letter. The Government's White Paper, you implied, said all that you had to say."</p></blockquote>
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter then goes on to deal with SSSIs. I do not wish to try the Committee's patience, but I should quote from a letter of 17 January from the Minister for the Environment and Countryside in reply to a letter from the NCC of 3 December. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On the question of staffing, the figures you have quoted entirely exclude the number of LPA staff who have been offered posts in the new agencies in accordance with their NCC contracts, and who will block permanent posts. This was agreed by government as a concession to staff; I do not think that it is helpful to anyone to imply that far more vacancies exist than is, or will be, the case in reality."</p></blockquote>
Obviously, there is a difference of opinion about the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the reasons why I was so passionately against the measure in the first place was because I believed the arguments of Dr. Derek Ratcliffe and others from Peterborough that it was putting in triplicate skilled work that had been done by specialists, many of whom I wanted to defend on Second Reading from the awful, unjustified things that were said in the House of Lords. That said, I shall now sit down to listen to the Government's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman appreciates, the JNCC was established following the recommendations of Lord Carver's committee. The issue was debated fully during the passage of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. The CCS is represented and will continue to be, until its merger with the NCC to create SNH. The JNCC can consider countryside matters if it wishes and its links with the CCS are good. The JNCC, secretariat will be based at the CCS headquarters in Battleby. The Government will continue to represent United Kingdom interests in the European Commission and international conventions. The Bill will continue the relationship on the same footing as that with the NCC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about staff and 140 additional staff will be required for the new Nature Conservancy Council for Scotland. There are vacancies for some of the new posts and recruitment is under way. The figures agreed by the Government are 51 staff, plus 35 staff in the special projects team. The programme for the committee's staff for the coming year has already been discussed. We have agreed to significant increases in the number of posts for the NCC for Scotland—as I said, 140 more for its directorate. We are willing to consider further new posts for SNH if that is necessary to achieve our aims. Decisions on that must await consideration of the consultant study.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the questions being examined by the study is where the best site for the headquarters of SNH would be. Countryside Commission for Scotland and NCC for Scotland staff—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I am aware that my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) has a strong interest in Battleby—will be able to transfer to SNH posts on terms and conditions no less favourable, taken as a whole, than the ones that they have at present. All new posts in SNH will be trawled among NCC for Scotland and CCS staff and will be filled on the basis of fair and open competition. That gives the hon. Member the up-to-date position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is extremely unhappy about the substance of the matter. The Minister will tell me if I am wrong. With all the talk of cutting back across the board and curtailing many valued projects, here we are creating 140 extra posts for doing what may not be a substantially different job. The screams that came from Peterborough more than a year ago were justified. Perhaps it will turn out that I am wrong, but that is how I see it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Many scientists were employed at Peterborough. The bulk of the scientific work is carried out in Scotland. As we are establishing SNH, it makes sense that sufficient scientists should be employed in Scotland to deal with the work that will be required
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
there. That will happen. There would be no point in all the scientists who are to work in Scotland being based in Peterborough, if they will be working for SNH.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be extremely helpful if I could have that information on Tuesday. At our next sitting, I should like to draw attention to the resources that will be allocated to the new agency. I again quote from Steve Barry's letter to the Minister for the Environment and Countryside of 23 January. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In my letter of 14 January, copied to you, I said in the first paragraph that the figure given by the NCC Chairman for the total resources allocated to the new agencies was 'slightly out', and that the TUS made it closer to £66m than £6.3m.</p></blockquote>
I went on to give a breakdown of each agency's budget, as follows:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<table class='table table-striped'>
	<tr>
	<td></td>
	<td>£m</td>
</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>NCC (E)</td>
	<td>31.4</td>
</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>CCW</td>
	<td>14.5".</td>
</tr>
</table>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Money and budgets will be discussed under clause 9. I remind the hon. Gentleman that we are talking about staffing resources. Money will be discussed at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, Mr. Martin, staffing and resorces are intertwined. Staffing is easily the largest element in the budgets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I accept that, but the hon. Gentleman will appreciate that I am not denying him

	<span class='label label-info column'>75</span>
an opportunity to discuss money and budgets. There will be a later opportunity for him to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly. If the Minister wishes to reply to the points made in Steve Berry's letter later in our proceedings, I would be the last person to quibble about that. If I may, however, I will finish quoting the extract from the letter, so that it is on the record. Steve Berry states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I did however draw an incorrect inference from the aggregate figure when contrasting this with that given by the Chairman and with the resource estimates for the new bodies contained in the PE/Inbucon report last May.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The Chairman's figure of c£63m is the total for the nature conservation element of the three new bodies. Contained within the CCW budget however is some £2.43m which is, as it were, Inherited' from the Countryside Commission.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The aggregate figure for nature conservation work alone therefore is indeed some £63m, just as the Chairman said, and is thus more than £2.5m short of what Inbucon recommended as the minimum necessary to allow the new bodies to carry out their statutory obligations."</p></blockquote>
The nub of the matter is whether the statutory obligations can be maintained even in the new circumstances.

I wish to ask a further question, not only to oblige the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker),
	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>
but because some of us believe that Battleby has a jolly good case. Will the Minister explain the Government's view on the future of Battleby at some stage in our proceedings? This will affect the whole of Scotland, not only the hon. Gentleman's constituency. As he said on Second Reading, the facilities are attractive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way. He has been tempting me to intervene for some minutes. When we are given the opportunity, I shall speak about the money provision. I assure the hon. Gentleman that I share his interest in scientists and in what happens at Battleby. His anxieties are the same as mine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that they are. I referred to Battleby because I was advised that now would be the best occasion on which to raise staffing matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
