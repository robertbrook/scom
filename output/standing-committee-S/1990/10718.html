	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the matter of housing in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that we are having this matter day debate on housing. It is always useful to hear the views of hon. Members. Many of the ideas put forward in such debates are acted upon either immediately or later in the year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to start by making a number of announcements about the pressing subject of homelessness. The plight of young homeless Scots people in London was raised recently in Scottish questions by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. Watson). I was urged to visit Centrepoint, an emergency centre for roofless youngsters in Soho, and have since done so. I was shown round by Mr. Ian Brady, who is a Scot, and who is doing a very impressive job. I was particularly struck, while talking to some of the youngsters at Centrepoint, by how unprepared they were when they left Scotland. They seemed to believe that they could leave home, jump on a bus to London and find accommodation and work immediately they arrived. Evidently, they do so with no preparations and little money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Centrepoint highlighted the urgent need to educate young people about the pitfalls of drifting to London. That is why I intend to give priority to initiatives that discourage young homeless Scots from moving to London without adequate preparation, job opportunities or money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister is worried about such people moving to London, he should be trying to keep them in Scotland. Dumbarton district council submitted to the Scottish Office the stopover project for homeless people in the Dumbarton district. The project was rejected, which is surprising given that the Scottish Office Environmental Department gave Dumbarton district council £250,000 to provide follow-on accommodation. Will the Minister undertake to keep the homeless people of Dumbarton in that district so that they do not go to London?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of that matter, which involved an urban aid application. I undertake to look into it. I shall deal later with urban aid. Substantial funds are being made available in Scotland. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman fully about the contents of the application, explaining why it was refused and what opportunities his council may be able to pursue, and I shall deal with the issue thoroughly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will know that I announced last December that the Scottish Office commissioned the centre for housing research at the university of Glasgow to undertake a study into the role of social work in the prevention and management of homelessness. It is hoped that the study, which will cost £80,000, will provide the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2</span>
basis for guidance on the best social work practice for both voluntary and statutory social work agencies. In particular, the study will examine policies and procedures to prevent homelessness in the first place and will consider what arrangements are needed to support those who become homeless. The Government understand the need for further efforts specifically to dissuade young Scots from moving to London. We consider it essential to encourage ways in which, through voluntary agencies and educational bodies, young people can be warned of the problems and dangers in advance. I am therefore pleased that the Government are today announcing offers of grant totalling £150,000 over the next three years to voluntary bodies for projects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monklands, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to explain what is being offered. I shall give way later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We invited applications for grant and our decisions represent a package designed to help voluntary agencies dealing with youth homelessness. The package has three elements. First, there are grants to bodies to provide advice and educational material to dissuade young Scots from drifting to London. There are grants to Shelter to provide advice to roofless young people and to act as a referral point for London agencies working with young Scots wishing to return home. Working in co-operation with Shelter will be the Scottish Community Education Council, which is receiving a grant to develop and produce educational material to set out for young Scots the reality of going to London without adequate preparation for accommodation and employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there are grants to bodies working in the major centres of population in Scotland. The Glasgow Council for the Single Homeless will receive a grant to develop a strategy to tackle the needs of city centre homeless in Glasgow. The Carolina House Trust will receive a grant to provide advice and guidance for young people leaving care and to assist young people returning from other parts of the United Kingdom to re-settle in Dundee. In Edinburgh, the Bethany Christian Trust and the Rock Trust will receive grants, the first to fund a furniture scheme for young people setting up in their own accommodation and the second to provide accommodation in Edinburgh for homeless young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third element is to provide grant for Borderline, a valuable project set up by the Church of Scotland in London to assist young homeless Scots in London wishing to return to Scotland. Borderline provides young Scots in London with travel warrants where it is certain that they have a place to go home to. It spent about £1,500 in the past year and expects to spend at least £3,000 this year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We welcome any proposals that will help young homeless people. I know that the Minister is spelling out the case but, if I heard him correctly, he said that there would be grants of £150,000 for three years. Will that be the amount provided each year or will it be £50,000 for each of the three years? If so, given the long list of organisations that are to receive that money, it does not seem that any will receive a substantial sum to enable them to do anything worth while.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must appreciate that that contribution over three years has
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0277">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>3</span>
to be seen in conjunction with other important funding. For example, since 1983, we have given to the urban aid programme about £9 million in assistance for 28 separate homelessness-related projects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to those grants, we shall also provide grant to the Scottish Youth Housing Network to publish a quarterly newsletter to co-ordinate activity among the voluntary sector dealing with homelessness. The £150,000 which we are making available to these bodies is targeted in the specific ways which I described. It is particularly aimed at providing information and help to young people to ensure that they do not drift to London and the difficulties they may find there, without adequate warning and information. As I said, that must be seen in the context of the much larger sums that have been made available to tackle homelessness through the urban aid programme. I mentioned the £9 million which has been made available since 1983. About £3·5 million has been given in the form of additional allocation to eight local authorities in Scotland for homelessness projects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To stop many youngsters and other homeless people drifting to London and other cities, money is needed for the revival of housing in Scotland. For example, last year, the Department of the Environment gave £93 million to housing associations in London specifically to deal with the problem of homelessness. There was no allocation through Scottish Homes to housing associations in Scotland to deal with that problem. We need such sums to tackle the problem of homelessness in Scotland. We should not merely try to stop youngsters going to London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come in a moment to the contribution of Scottish Homes in that context and deal with the specific points that the hon. Gentleman mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second announcement concerns advice to homeless people. As the Committee will be aware, earlier this year we issued to authorities a revised code of guidance on the way in which their statutory homelessness functions should be carried out. This was generally welcomed by authorities and by the various representative groups working with the homeless. The guidance in the code is for local authority officials and other housing professionals dealing with the homeless. We felt that it would be useful to supplement the code by giving advice in a more convenient form to homeless people themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am able to announce that we are publishing a leaflet to explain the help that is available for homeless persons. A copy is to be found on the table in the Committee Room. The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities was consulted on what should appear in the leaflet, which is being distributed to local authorities, health boards, citizens advice bureaux, Department of Social Security offices and other agencies where leaflets will be readily available to the public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Lambie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cunninghame, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We need housing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate exactly what the hon. Gentleman says.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While speaking about homelessness, let me draw the Committee's attention to five other important points. As I mentioned, the Scottish Office has allocated an additional
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
£3·5 million in capital resources for specific homelessness projects to eight local authorities—Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Dundee, Falkirk, Renfrew, Kirkcaldy and Dumbarton. Those authorities receive the bulk of the applications made under the homelessness legislation. I am particularly pleased by the imaginative approach adopted by those authorities for investing the resources in a range of accommodation, much of which is intended for young homeless persons. For example, the additional resources will fund a 16-bed direct access emergency hostel for the single homeless in Edinburgh and flexible supported accommodation for 16 young people in a core house and cluster flats in Renfrew district. There are many other examples.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister take his mind back to the earlier part of his speech—before he started reading his interesting script? Does he recall that he announced a study, which will presumably involve Glasgow university? Will he assure the Committee that housing authorities and housing agencies, as well as social work departments, will have an input into the study? The hon. Gentleman mentioned the problems of young people. Will he do what members of the Children Bill Standing Committee achieved—meet the young people and hear from them how the problems were created in Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the first point, Professor Duncan MacLennan is involved—it is his centre for research. I have no doubt that there will be proper consultation and research with the bodies to which the hon. Gentleman referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the second point about the Children Act 1989, it is important to be fully in touch and to have consulted fully. The child care law review recommended extending local authorities' powers in respect of young people previously in their care in Scotland. We are considering those recommendations and a White Paper will be issued detailing the Government's proposals on the reform of child care in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Housing support grant would be extended so that all local authorities with hostels would receive a financial contribution towards the cost of running those hostels. In the current year, more than £1·4 million is being paid to local authorities for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have encouraged local authorities to make cash incentive schemes to help the homeless, and I am pleased that an increasing number of authorities are now doing so. It was not until last year that the first Scottish local authority—Bearsden and Milngavie—took advantage of the provisions to introduce cash incentive schemes. Since then, a steady stream of authorities has expressed interest in following suit. Three further schemes have been approved, in Edinburgh, Gordon and North East Fife; and I am aware of four more authorities which are drawing up proposals. Those schemes can play a useful role as part of a local authority's strategy for dealing with homelessness. For the equivalent cost of building one new house, three or four council houses can be released for the benefit of the homeless or others in housing need.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that the tenant incentive scheme, under which £9,000 is paid to sitting tenants to move out of public sector houses, releasing them for the local authority to give to the homeless? In fact, nothing is given to the homeless—the money is given to the sitting tenants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0278">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. The cash incentive is given to the tenant to move out; but the cost-effectiveness of the scheme, as I explained, is that it frees three or four houses for the homeless as the tenant who wishes to purchase moves out. That scheme can play a useful role in certain parts of Scotland, and is increasingly being taken up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to answer a point raised earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am particularly anxious that more should be done to help relieve homelessness by making better use of empty houses. The majority of the estimated 127,000 empty houses in Scotland are in the private sector. Scottish Homes' rural housing strategy is making an important contribution to dealing with this problem. This year, Scottish Homes expects to spend £54 million in rural areas. That will fund an expanding programme of initiatives, especially in the 10 rural demonstration areas. Scottish Homes grants for rent and ownership are available to help builders and individuals to provide low-cost housing. Scottish Homes is also expecting to introduce other initiatives shortly, including ways of bringing empty housing in rural areas back into use, especially for the rural homeless. For example, Scottish Homes is currently working up proposals with the Forestry Commission on ways in which surplus commission housing can be brought back into beneficial use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are some 27,000 empty houses in the public sector, of which more than 3,000 have been empty for more than four months. I am determined that all landlords, whether local authorities, Government or Government agencies should examine their strategies for dealing with empty houses, including the scope for sale to housing associations. That is why we are setting up a research study beginning this autumn to examine empty public sector houses in Scotland. The aim of the research is to look at the extent, location and characteristics of empty property in Scotland owned by the public sector, including local and central Government. The results of the study will provide a sound basis for planning the more effective use of empty houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As Sir James Mellon stated recently when the spoke to housing associations, Scottish Homes is giving increasing priority to homelessness. Last year, one third of the nominations made by local authorities to Scottish Homes for filling vacancies in its own stock were in respect of people who were homeless. More than 1,000 housing units have been grant-aided by Scottish Homes in the past two years specifically to cater for the homeless. For our part, the Government have this year increased by £2·2 million the already substantial resources available to Scottish Homes specifically to address the problems of those in acute housing need in both urban and rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to refer briefly to the problems which can arise from houses and flats offered for rent and in multiple occupation. In May this year, we gave local authorities in Scotland the power to introduce licensing schemes for houses in multiple occupation, under which they can more effectively enforce the provision of proper standards. We issued—for consultation purposes—a draft code of guidance to the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities on the way in which the range of local authorities' powers
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
in relation to HMOs should be used. We are considering the convention's response, and I hope that we can issue the final code of guidance within the next few weeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned Sir James Mellon's speech to the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations in which he said that Scottish Homes was considering transferring empty private properties to housing associations to help the homeless. The Minister did not refer to that—or if he did, I did not hear him. Can he confirm that that has been not just considered but that it will happen?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am confident not only that Scottish Homes has been asked by the Scottish Office to give priority to dealing with homelessness applications and issues but that that will be done effectively. Sir James Mellon spelt out the detailed plans at that housing association conference and I am glad that he has adopted that approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now turn to one of the most important themes that underpins the Government's approach to housing policy—increasing the choice available for people to meet their housing aspirations. The Government have taken great strides in opening up opportunities for home ownership, especially through the right-to-buy legislation, and more recently through the pilot rent-to-mortgage scheme, now extended to local authority tenants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to put the facts before the Grand Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since 1979, 230,741 public sector houses have been sold, of which 223,400 were sold to sitting tenants. As a consequence, the proportion of owner-occupied dwellings in Scotland increased from 35 per cent. in 1979 to nearly 52 per cent. today. Home ownership is now the majority tenure, with more than 1 million owner-occupied homes. That is a significant achievement and we are determined to build on the progress that we have made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As many as a quarter of a million public sector tenants could have bought their homes by the time of the next election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must, however, draw attention to the fact that not all authorities have been as active as they might be in encouraging council house sales. I regard it as unacceptable that some authorities take more than a year on average to process applications into sales. That hinders tenants who wish to exercise their right to buy and harms existing council tenants because capital receipts which could be used to boost investment in council houses are less than would otherwise be the case. Processing times of more than a year are quite unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) is sitting on the Opposition Front Bench today and will respond to the debate. I should like to pay tribute to his city.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall in a moment, but I want to pay a tribute to Dundee. At the end of 1989, I strongly criticised Dundee district council's record. At that time, the council was taking more than 14 months to process right-to-buy sales. In the first quarter of this year, that figure had been cut to six months. That shows what
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0279">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
can be done where there is a will. I hold Dundee's example up as a model to authorities throughout Scotland, especially Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow, which still take more than 10 months on average to process RTB sales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) cannot authorise other hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am the Minister's Member of Parliament, so I hope that he recognises me. I do my best to look after his interests, along with those of many other people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is speaking of tenants buying their homes. What does he have to say about the problems facing tenants who have bought their council houses but subsequently had their homes repossessed as a consequence of mortgage defaults? The Minister knows that this is particularly a problem in East Lothian. It is galling for the local authority which, having lost a house at a vast discount, has to rehouse the household in its rapidly diminishing housing stock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can the Minister help local authorities meet that need?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could make several points. Only 4 per cent. of homelessness applications are made on the ground of repossession. The hon. Gentleman speaks of particular problems in his area; they are not common to his area alone. There are similar problems in Gordon. We are aware of them and, if supplementary allocations are made later in the year, we shall take into account the specific point which the hon. Gentleman mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to answer the question about separate figures for Scotland not being given by building societies. That happens for reasons of confidentiality. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I shall explain why building societies refuse to give that information: if a building society admitted that it had carried out many more repossessions than another building society, it would be afraid that that would have an adverse effect on its commercial position. Whether that is right or wrong, the societies will not give the figures. They have said, however, that the rate of repossession in Scotland is running at about half that south of the border. The matter should be seen in context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is much more to be done before all Scots have the housing tenure that they prefer. I believe that our latest initiative, the rent-to-mortgage scheme, offers a valuable
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
opportunity to many tenants who would like to own their own homes. The new RTM scheme is steadily gathering momentum. Interest in the new scheme is broadly comparable with the level of activity at the equivalent stage in the development of the right to buy. There have already been 178 sales to Scottish Homes or new town tenants and 152 applications have been made from those sectors. Our publicity campaign generated about 20,000 inquiries, a quarter of which were from the Glasgow postcode area. That alone is evidence of a remarkable level of interest in what is still a relatively new scheme. To date, more than 2,000 counselling visits to council tenants have been arranged, and that has led to the submission of 398 formal applications to purchase. I fully expect many more applications to follow, particularly from those tenants who have chosen to receive the counselling offered by Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth highlighting the fact that interest in the RTM scheme is spread throughout Scotland, inquiries for free counselling having been received from tenants in every district and islands council, and firm applications already having been lodged by tenants in 48 of the 56 authority areas. In addition to the interest in the cities, tenants in Motherwell, Hamilton, Renfrew, Falkirk, East Lothian, Kyle and Carrick, Perth and Kinross, Moray and Gordon seem particularly keen to know more about the RTM scheme. That shows its broad appeal throughout Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Sillars 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have several points to make. The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very well. I give way to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Sillars).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sillars</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do the people giving the counselling tell tenants that, once they have bought their house, they need a certain level of income to meet the substantial repairs and maintenance costs involved in owner-occupation? I hear at my surgery that people, particularly old-age pensioners, found it better to get a mortgage under the rent-to-mortgage scheme than to pay higher rents but now simply cannot meet the £4,000, £5,000 or £6,000 costs for major repairs and maintenance and are faced with the prospect of allowing their stock to deteriorate. Is that truth about the rent-to-mortgage scheme being told to folk?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt that people will be thoroughly informed of the responsibilities that they are assuming. It was precisely because of the risk to people who could not afford the costs that we excluded those on housing benefit. We started the scheme cautiously but thoroughly, and I have no doubt that it will be a success. For example, if an authority has 50 voluntary sales under the RTM scheme, that would enhance receipts for its programme of spending on public sector housing by £500,000. That is why I strongly urge authorities such as Glasgow to take part in the scheme. I am pleased once more to praise Dundee for accepting the voluntary proposal. That is to Dundee's credit and will benefit its funding.

On investment, I announced in March this year that we were making available total resources of £565 million to

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
authorities to support capital investment in Scottish housing. In recognition of the downturn in capital receipts, the net allocations have been increased by £23·3 million, so local authorities will be able to maintain their capital spending per house at the same level this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the non-housing revenue account block, the sum for Scotland totals £111 million, and those are substantial resources. We have earmarked funds for Edinburgh's backlog, about which a question was raised yesterday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already mentioned the £3·5 million made available for homelessness projects. We have announced a further £2 million for energy efficiency projects in six local authorities. I visited Paisley recently and met representatives of Renfrew district council, and I am making available to that council an additional £128,000 to fund environmental improvements associated with housing co-operative and association developments in Ferguslie park, which I hope will assist that council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since 1979, capital investment in Scottish housing has increased by more than 19 per cent. in real terms, whereas there was a reduction of more than 35 per cent. in real terms during the five preceding years when the Labour party was in Government. Since 1979, 240,000 new houses have been built—175,000 by the private sector, 17,000 by housing associations and 48,000 by local authorities and other public sector agencies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will have his chance in a few minutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In financial terms, we have given Scottish Homes substantial resources—nearly £600 million worth of investment—and it plans to spend more than £300 million this year. Of that, more than £149 million is to be spent on the traditional housing association programme, £22 million is for community ownership projects, £18 million is for projects in urban partnerships and £24 million is to be spent under Scottish Homes' new powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lambie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned funding for local authorities, housing associations and Scottish Homes.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall wind up, if my hon. and learned Friend will allow me, because I have several questions to ask the hon. Member for Cathcart, of which I gave him notice in writing. Is it Labour party policy that housing support grant should be increased to meet two fifths of local authority housing costs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. As we all read the Minister's statement in this morning's editions of the 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> and 	<i>The Scotsman,</i> would it not save the Committee's time if he just accepted that it was on record?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There were many interesting items in this morning's 	<i>Glasgow Herald,</i> which I read myself, but none of them was relevant to this debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be grateful if the hon. Member for Cathcart would explain his party's policy on housing support grant and tell us whether he believes that taxes should be increased by 2½p in the pound to pay for it. Does he stand by the spending pledge that he made in the debate on housing subsidies in the House in January that housing support grant should be increased by £62 million to enable housing authorities
	<br><blockquote><p>"to stand still on housing expenditure."?—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 23 January 1991; Vol. 184, c. 393]</p></blockquote>
Is it his policy to increase the general fund contribution so that community charge payers subsidise council housing costs? Can the House take it that the passage in the Labour party's housing policy document suggesting that a future Labour Government would either cut mortgage interest relief or increase spending and thus taxes represents a huge threat to home ownership in Scotland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cathcart is quoted in this morning's press as saying that my letter was factually inaccurate on one point. In the interests of the Committee, will he identify any inaccuracies so that I can confirm that the rest of the letter is an accurate analysis of his party's policy? We look forward to the hon. Gentleman's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.3 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have rarely sat through 30-odd minutes of a speech and heard so little about the Government's policy on housing. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Members for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) and for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) are wittering as usual, but the simple fact is that the Minister took 15 minutes to announce that the Government are providing the grand total of £150,000 over three years to tackle the problem of homelessness—that is £50,000 a year. That was the only new money provided to tackle the problem of the more than 31,000 homeless people in Scotland—an increase of 91 per cent. since 1983. That is the number of homeless people in Scotland—not in London or anywhere else. All that the Minister could tell us in an announcement lasting a quarter of an hour was that he was giving £150,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is not prepared to accept that, by introducing legislation to remove from young people the right to certain social security benefits, the Government—of whom he is a member—have forced them on to the streets because they cannot afford any sort of housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman should be tackling that problem. He made no announcement about providing new money for homeless people in Scotland or about providing young people with an income, jobs and housing. The Government are not giving them a single penny. The hon. Gentleman referred to grants of £150,000 and then spent a brief three minutes at the end of his speech saying what he expected us to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman appreciate that, in London, the Royal Scottish Corporation, which was founded in 1613, provides

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
£500,000 a year to house people? The nationalists might take to heart what is printed on the corporation's great box. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Behold how good a thing it is and how becoming well together such as brethren are in unitie to dwell".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the years go by, the interventions of the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir N. Fairbairn) become more obscure and more difficult to follow. I had some difficulty in following that one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for local authorities that take so long to sell their housing stock, it is worth pointing out that the third worst authority in that regard is one of the two Tory local authorities in Scotland—Bearsden and Milngavie district council. It takes an enormously long time to sell its houses. One problem that people have when they sell their homes is getting them registered. The registration office in Scotland was, until recently, a Government department. It is now an executive agency. When people buy their council houses, they must register that fact. At present, it takes 89 weeks to register a property, yet the Government are complaining about the actions of local authorities. The Minister should first get his Government departments into line before he complains about local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to the Minister's remarkable letter, which was much longer than his speech. I wish to make one apology to him and to the press, which published my mistake. I accept that my figure of £62 million to which the Minister referred in his letter was an error. I first thought that it was a mistake in 	<i>Hansard,</i> because the figure should have read £6·2 million. However, I cannot blame 	<i>Hansard</i> for the mistake because the figure of £62 million is on my computer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have apologised for what was a typographical error on my part, perhaps it is time that the Minister started apologising for the housing problems. He could start by being the first Scottish Office Minister to apologise for imposing the poll tax on people in Scotland. Perhaps he would like to apologise to the 31,000 people who are homeless in Scotland. He could apologise to those who live in damp houses and to the people whose houses are being repossessed because of high interest rates. They are the apologies that we want to hear from the Minister. I was happy to make my apology, so perhaps the hon. Gentleman would make his.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Give way to the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister wishes to make his apologies, I shall happily give way to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not usually a churlish individual. However, on this occasion, I am happy to boast that I am. Within the remarkable letter sent to me by the Minister are the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Only the most churlish of individuals could fail to acknowledge the huge strides that have been made in Scottish housing since 1979."</p></blockquote>
I must be a churlish individual, because I do not consider that there have been any great strides in Scottish housing. I am proud to be churlish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister thinks that the debate will be about our proposals and not about the Government's record, he has another think coming. The last few minutes of the hon. Gentleman's speech and also what he wrote in his letter were a smokescreen to hide the fact that the Government's record is appalling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
The Minister is demanding that I give answers and say where the money will come from. I will not take lessons on financial prudence from a Government who readily increased taxation and found nearly £500 million when faced with the electoral disaster of the poll tax. That sum was added to the billions of pounds that the Government previously wasted on that cruelly partial tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman cannot tell me, today, what he will spend on housing or anything else in the next financial year and he is the Minister. Why does he expect me to do so? We are rightly committed to finding more money to spend on public and social housing in Scotland. It will be a massive task to repair the damage that the Minister and his equally inept predecessors have wrought on Scottish housing in the past 13 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume that the Minister will stand in the next general election as a Tory candidate on the policy of cutting income tax to 20p in the pound. That assumes a rate of growth in the economy that, presumably, will allow the Conservatives to cut taxes from increased revenue rather than by cutting services. The hon. Member for Tayside, North nods. We will not further reduce income tax and we shall use the revenue from increased growth in more constructive ways, including spending on housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened to many ministerial speeches in Scottish Grand Committee debates and at times I have wondered whether we were living on the same planet, let alone in the same country. The Scotland that Ministers describe, especially in relation to housing, bears no relation to the one that I, my hon. Friends and the people of Scotland know. The Scotland described by Ministers has a booming economy: the people are happy, the health service is expanding and meeting people's medical needs and everyone lives in a pleasant house in a pleasant environment. The fact that Ministers think that anyone believes such nonsense shows an arrogance that is beyond belief and desperation as the Government try to retrieve their electoral position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In housing, especially, the Government's record is dreadful and it is getting worse, yet the Minister boasts about their achievement. In a letter to me, he stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I shall point out that 18,000 houses a year are being built in Scotland."</p></blockquote>
He used other statistics in his speech to make the same point. I accept what he said, but in 1979, under a Labour Government, nearly 24,000 houses were built in Scotland. What is so wonderful about cutting the number of houses built in Scotland by nearly 6,000?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall spell out the Government's record on housing so that we can judge whether the Minister has any right to boast about it. Since 1979—that is where the Minister gets his figure of £355 million and his reference to two fifths—the only direct subsidy by central Government to housing in Scotland has been cut in cash terms by £228 million to £55 million this year. In real terms, the cut is even more savage. In cash terms, £1·5 billion has been cut from housing expenditure in Scotland. The Minister wants me to back off from our commitment to retrieve some of that money for housing in Scotland, but I will not do so. In 1979, rents supplied 47 per cent. of local authority housing costs; housing support grant, 39 per cent.; and the rate fund contribution, 14 per cent. This year, rents contributed 93 per cent.; housing support grant, 7 per cent.; and the general fund contribution, 1 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about housing benefit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Every year, the hon. Member for Tayside, North goes on about housing benefit. Housing benefit has been cut in Scotland in terms of the number of people who should be entitled to it. A major reason why there is more housing benefit in Scotland is that it has more poor people and more poverty. I have to tell the hon. Member for Tayside, North that all the time, but perhaps I should not waste my breath because, obviously, he does not understand me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that when local authorities put up rents, that is paid for from increased housing benefit so that taxpayers' money goes straight into the housing coffers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The rents of those not on housing benefit increase as well. People on low incomes who struggle to make ends meet must pay their rents out of those incomes, not out of housing benefit. The hon. Gentleman constantly forgets that. The level at which people receive housing benefit is lower now than in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend join me in condemning the Conservatives for removing from widows, senior citizens and others on the lowest incomes 100 per cent. support towards housing when they introduced their mean and penny-pinching 20 per cent. compulsory deduction from the lowest widows' pay and the lowest pensions? Is not that an utter disgrace?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely. That makes nonsense of the points that the hon. Member for Tayside, North always raises in these debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way in which rents have increased against the housing support grant has meant an additional £7 a week for those living in council housing. Rents have risen by 350 per cent. since 1979, compared with inflation of just over 120 per cent. The results of those cuts in Government spending on housing are obvious. In 1986—we do not have more recent figures—COSLA, using Scottish Office statistics, showed that 356,000 council houses needed modernisation, 88,000 needed rewiring, 234,000 suffered from dampness or condensation and 153,000 needed major or structural repairs. COSLA estimated then that it would require £900 million a year for 10 years to solve that crisis, yet the Minister boasted about a capital allocation of £550 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In real terms—not cash—capital allocations have been cut by 9 per cent. this year. It is always worth remembering that capital allocations are not a Government grant; they represent a local authority's ability to borrow. The Minister boasted about Scottish Homes, but its capital programme has been cut by 7 per cent. in real terms. The much-vaunted and long-awaited results of the house conditions survey will show that those figures are a gross underestimation of the real problem in Scottish housing and that we may need to spend well over £1 billion a year simply to improve conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Too many of our fellow citizens are living in poor housing conditions because of the Government's callous disregard for their needs and are paying ever-higher rents for that privilege. As I have said already, homelessness has increased by 91 per cent. Everyone but the Minister is actively involved in Scottish housing—the tenants, local authority officials, Scottish Homes officials in the field—knows that there is a major crisis which, like the poll tax,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
is almost entirely of the Government's making. Far from making wild claims about his record, the Minister would do well to hang his head in shame at the chaos and misery that he has helped to create for so many of his fellow citizens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his famous letter the Minister says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"These success stories reflect the Government's determination to extend opportunity and increase choice in housing for everyone in Scotland."</p></blockquote>
By using those words, the Minister descends to a farcical cynicism that would be laughable if the truth were not so bitter to so many of the people in Scotland. What choice is there for the 50 per cent. of families in Scotland who cannot afford to buy their homes but find themselves living in ever-poorer quality housing—housing that is damp, in need of rewiring or major repairs? They have no choice; they simply pay ever-higher rents for less and less service. What choice is there for owner-occupiers who are increasingly unable to meet their mortgage payments and, having been enticed into home ownership by the Government, now find that the Government disclaim all responsibility when things go wrong?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have made much of housing associations as an alternative for local authority tenants. However, the capital programme of Scottish Homes has been cut by 7 per cent. and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) knows, extra responsibilities such as the community care programme are being piled on to the housing associations without any extra resources being provided by the Government. In an intervention, I mentioned the £93 million that was provided to housing associations to deal with homelessness in London. Not a single penny was given to housing associations in Scotland. This year, housing associations in England and Wales are receiving double the money that they received last year. There is no extra money for the housing associations in Scotland. They are still expected to deal with the problems of homelessness and community care but the Government are not prepared to do anything more about the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What choice is there for new town tenants as the Government wind up the new town corporations? I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) has left the Chair. He has campaigned to give his constituents a genuine choice, as have other of my hon. Friends who represent new towns. Recently, we had a meeting with the Parliamentary Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), to discuss the problem of the choice being offered to new town tenants. He made it clear that new town tenants would not be allowed to exercise an individual choice or even a collective choice through a ballot to select a landlord. The Government will not allow a new town tenant or group of tenants, through a ballot, to choose the local authority as a landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the nature of the choice offered by the Government. In fact, the Government are denying choice to those tenants. That is the choice that the Minister glibly talks about. The Government do not believe in real choice. They have reduced the ability to rent rather than buy—because there are now fewer houses available for rent in Scotland. The Government are obsessed with one choice and one choice only—home ownership. As with the poll tax, their obsession has caused a crisis that only the end of this Government can ensure. The sooner that that happens the better.

The Minister is keen to ask me questions about our programme, but what will he do about the housing crisis in Scotland? As he has attacked us for suggesting that we would spend more money on housing when we come to power, should we assume that he is wilfully going to allow our housing stock to deteriorate into ever-greater disrepair? Does he intend that rents should continue to soar? What extra money will he allocate to Scottish Homes and to local authorities to deal with the problem of homelessness? He is the Minister responsible for housing. I should be delighted next year, when I am sitting in his place as Minister, to tell him what we shall do. This year, we need to know what he will do about housing. Rather than asking me questions, the hon. Gentleman should demand money from the Treasury to deal with the housing crisis in Scotland. If he is not prepared to do that, he should make way for those who are prepared to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Norman A. Godman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Port Glasgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I refer to column 38 of the 	<i>Official Report</i> of our sitting on 11 July 1991. I asked my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg), who was in the chair, whether he had the authority to extend the sitting by 15 minutes. I suggested that the Chairman of a Standing Committee had such authority. He replied that he would consider the position at 1 o'clock. I wonder whether you, Mr. Martin, and my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth have considered that position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The situation is clear. I have that power, but I do not have to use it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.25 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Minister. His sensitive and enterprising approach to housing will be appreciated by all who genuinely care about finding solutions to the complex problems of housing. Anyone who has driven around Scotland recently will have seen the dramatic and fundamental changes that have taken place in, for example, Dundee. I welcome the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) to the Opposition Front Bench—this seems to be the week for Dundee on the Opposition Front Bench. I am not unhappy about that, as it gives me the opportunity to draw attention to areas in the constituency of the hon. Member for Dundee, East where, I believe that he would agree, there have been dramatic improvements in the council housing stock. I congratulate Government agencies, Dundee council and the private sector on their enterprise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I grew up in Dundee, and vividly remember the problems of Fintry, Midcraigie, Whitfield and other housing estates. One need only drive around the housing estates in Dundee to see the dramatic improvements that have taken place. Those improvements were brought about by several factors, not the least of which was that the Government ensured that resources were made available to those who wished to use enterprise and initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister brings a sensitive and enterprising approach to housing. That is shown by the £9 million urban aid programme and the £3·5 million that has been given to eight local authorities for homelessness projects. I welcome my hon. Friend's interest in the problem of homelessness, and especially of homeless Scots in London. I, too, have been involved with the problem. I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
welcome the fact that the Salvation Army, the Church of Scotland and other voluntary bodies, which do a splendid job, will receive funds from the public purse to assist their work. I welcome the fact that Scottish Homes has spent £560 million on improving council housing stock in Scotland. A further £300 million will be spent in 1991–92, which will allow 5,000 new houses to be built.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is background noise, which is being dealt with. It is not the fault of the hon. Member, but could he speak up to assist in reporting the debate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not often that I am asked to speak up, but I shall certainly do so. The hon. Member for Dundee, East well knows that my voice is heard very loudly throughout Tayside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the fact that the rent-to-mortgage scheme, which was pioneered in Scotland, has now been extended. Not everyone wishes to own his own home, but I sincerely believe that the Government's policy on home ownership has done more to spread the nation's wealth than anything attempted by a socialist Government. We are giving more people than ever before the opportunity to pass inherited wealth on to their children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Grants for individuals to provide homes and to service sites in rural areas are enterprising initiatives. I welcome Scottish Homes' efforts. We must find a way to provide rural housing that is low in cost to buy or to rent. Grants of up to £10,000 for that are very welcome. I also welcome the fact that Scottish Homes has a pilot programme in my constituency in the Angus glens, and I look forward to seeing how that will evolve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Angus and East of Scotland Housing Association does a good job in my constituency. In Letham, it is currently building the largest village in Angus and it would like the present programme to be extended for a further year. It would be more cost effective if the assocation could continue to work on the site where it already operates. I have approached Scottish Homes about the matter and believe that I am getting a sympathetic hearing. It is important to have a sympathetic approach to tackling the problems because no one denies that there are problems of homelessness or that 31,000 homes in the public sector in Scotland are presently unoccupied. The question is how we can bring together the management and resources to render habitable those 31,000 homes and tackle the problem of homelessness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every member of the Committee must encounter a problem in their constituency surgeries that did not exist when I was a young man—because of the breakdown of marriages, often one party will retain the family home. Society must face that phenomenon of this age. In most instances, when a family unit breaks down and the husband or wife leaves, with one of them retaining the family home, the person who has left will immediately register himself or herself as requiring another home. Frequently, such people become one of the homeless statistics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although one wishes to deal sympathetically with people in those circumstances, one must ask whether we have more of a duty to the young who are starting their married life to ensure that they are allocated properties. Do not they have greater priority than those who have had their opportunities to have a house allocated to them? I pass no comment on the fact that such people have been unable to make their marriages work, because that could

happen to anyone, but we must ask at what point can we no longer fund those continuing breakdowns. I do not know the answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that those breakdowns will make ever-increasing demands on the public purse, so at what point can they no longer be funded? I am not making a judgment because I believe that those who do are often in danger of finding their families faced with such circumstances. I hope that my children will have the happy family life that I have been fortunate enough to enjoy as both child and adult.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Far too many women are driven from their family homes with their children because of the violent, drunken and—perhaps it is wrong to say this—psychopathic behaviour of their husbands. If the hon. Gentleman wants to discuss the breakdown of marriage and people being made homeless, he should remember the desperate straits in which such women find themselves. What he is saying about them is utterly disgraceful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I deliberately tried not to go into the specific reasons why marriages break down, because that is a minefield. It is a phenomenon of this age and I give the same proper attention to those of my constituents, especially women, who are involved in those breakdowns as the hon. Gentleman probably gives to his. I like to think that I behave in a Christian way to all who find themselves in difficulty. I pass no further comment other than to say that this is the right forum to face that ever-increasing problem and to ask: what are we going to do about it? I do not have simple, explicit answers—I wish I did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sillars</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give the hon. Gentleman an answer: we should not draw a distinction between people who are rendered homeless, whatever their circumstances. That is the answer to the question that, in my view, the hon. Gentleman should not have asked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention because it tells people his view and his attitude. I have not made up my mind with as much certainty as the hon. Gentleman has. I have a deep concern for those who have been on the housing list for a long time and who live a good life. They set good standards for themselves and their children and are good members of society. We face real problems in that respect, and it would be wrong not to face them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Garscadden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not dwell on the example given by my hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman), which, sadly, I accept is a real problem in our society. There are many cases of people being unable to live together; they cannot get on for many reasons. It may be just chemistry—it happens frequently and it is no use pretending that it does not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In such circumstances, Glasgow district council takes the view that special priority should be given to a spouse displaced from the matrimonial home. In a genuine marriage breakdown when the woman has to leave, perhaps with children, it is unfair that, because she has no ranking in the normal allocation system, she may be put into the most difficult and unpopular social area. In Glasgow, the woman has priority and she is given a house comparable to that of the matrimonial home. I strongly support that policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take it from the hon. Gentleman's remarks that not only does he disapprove of such a priority but he believes
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
that people in those circumstances should go to the bottom of the queue and that they are social misfits because their marriages have failed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An aspect of our debates on the great social problems facing the modern generation that I find disturbing and distressing is hon. Members' contempt for the care of others. We may view matters in a different light, but it is not that we do not care. We are trying to find solutions to complex problems within a viable time scale. That is what we must face up to. It is easy to wear one's heart on one's sleeve, but it is hard to find answers to complex problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Contrary to what the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) believes, I am interested not in the complexion of anyone's politics but in finding answers to complex problems. I praised Dundee district council for its good work. I have always complimented those who look like finding enterprising solutions, regardless of their political complexion. That is why I welcome the attitude of my hon. Friend the Minister. His sensitive approach is essential if we are to find solutions within a viable time scale.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.38 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not dwell on the comments of the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker). In housing, as in other matters, the Government have created many social divisions and the hon. Gentleman added to them this morning. That contrasts with the Conservative manifesto for Scotland at the general election, which said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Quite simply, Conservatives alone can revolutionise the face of Scottish Housing and provide a better home environment for all our people."</p></blockquote>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends will reflect on that commitment, which has not been met. What he said was not helpful and, later, he may take that view himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) suggested, I want to discuss the relationship between housing and community care, but I begin by making a few constituency points. No one will expect me to apologise for that because, whether or not we like it, the experience of all hon. Members from our surgeries and mail bags is that housing is still a priority. The Government give the impression that the only issue that matters in the economy is the interest rate. Similarly, when we try to hold a reasonable discussion on housing problems in Scotland, the Government merely resort to slogans about the sale of council houses. They do not even consider the problems that that policy has created.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are considerable problems in Monklands and Strathkelvin in my constituency. I am sorry that those areas did not feature in any of the lists that the Minister recited this morning, which were, I concede, largely cosmetic. From time to time I have tried to explain to the House the great problem in Monklands, which impinges on the district council's strategy for house building. That problem involves derelict land and the necessary release of green field sites to provide desperately needed houses. The council is keen to tackle the problem, but it cannot do so on its own. It needs recognition from the Scottish Office and from other agencies. It does not welcome the imbalance of 72 per cent. of housing stock in Monklands being council owned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A recent council survey shows that 75 per cent. of young people want to buy their homes, but the lack of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0285">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
available land for house building stands in their way. In assessing the problems brought day after day to the notice of its busy housing department, the council estimates that it requires 1,000 houses a year for the next five years. As it has no prospect of achieving that, the area is losing its young people. That does not make for a balanced economy or for a balanced contribution to employment prospects in Monklands which, of course, wants to be attractive enough to retain those young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish Homes has been mentioned. I have the greatest personal regard for Sir James Mellon, but there are great worries in my constituency, especially in Townhead and Glenboig, about the objectives of Scottish Homes, which seems to be committed to disposing within the next five years of its role as a public sector landlord. The Lanarkshire Federation of Scottish Homes Tenants and Residents is worried about the recent announcement on management agency agreements. People are anxious that stock transfers will mean that they will end up with landlords in the private sector whom they do not want and did not choose. Lanarkshire Members of Parliament and Scottish Homes will meet during the summer recess when I hope that Scottish Homes will accept the need for genuine participation by tenants, for people to be free to consider all the options, including the possibilities of local councils becoming their landlords if they so wish, and for training, so that people can make an informed choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Strathkelvin, the issues that we are debating today, including the information from Shelter on the homeless, is writ large. Shelter has said that there has been an increase of 91 per cent. in homelessness since 1983. In the first six months of this year, homelessness in Strathkelvin rose by 35 per cent. compared with the same period last year. Much of that homelessness has arisen not in areas of public housing but in places such as Lenzie because of the problems caused by mortgage rates and dispossessions. An increasing number of young people cannot meet their commitments. The Government have not tackled those problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned homelessness among the young in his opening remarks and the vital need for a community care strategy. He said nothing new or tangible today. Nothing that he has said challenges the enormous problem that we can see near this House. For Scottish youngsters, the problem begins in Scotland itself. It begins with unemployment and the radical, unacceptable changes made in 1988 to the social security system and housing benefit. Those problems did not happen by accident. Little that the Government have done has helped the young homeless. The evidence supports the claim of the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations that the abolition of the hostel deficit grant by 1993 will not help matters one iota. The federation cannot plan for future housing needs because of the Government's commitment to that unhelpful change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government are to address the problems of housing, they cannot do so in isolation. When I read or hear the statements of the Secretary of State and Minister of State on health or community care, there seems to be no co-ordination. They do not understand that those issues have a specific relationship with housing. The quality of housing for the most vulnerable people is important in the provision of community care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
There are in Scotland some fine examples of best practice and I want them to be increased. There is for example Bield housing for the elderly and Edinvar, of which my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) will be aware. People with disabilities are living with able-bodied people in the same community. That is in the interests of both groups. Many people challenge—though I am not sure whether the Government do—the suggestion in the Griffiths report that housing authorities, including local authorities, should confine themselves to dealing with bricks and mortar. I disagreed with that view in the report and when it was reflected in the Government's document "Caring for People". To respond to the needs of the elderly, the physically disabled and others, it is necessary to plan properly, to have joint planning and to have proper investment in housing provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[MR. NORMAN HOGG 	<i>in the Chair</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning on BBC's "Breakfast Time" there was an interesting piece by Polly Toynbee about an elderly lady in hospital. We were told of the enormous costs of keeping patients there. When interviewed the elderly lady said that she did not want to be in hospital and would prefer her own little flat. She pointed out that she would need a home help, meals on wheels and perhaps occupational therapy. That is genuine community care, but what happens if that woman cannot get the little flat that she wants?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How many people are unsuitably placed because we are not making this essential provision through local authorities, housing associations or Scottish Homes? The absence of such provision means that in many cases we have the revolving door syndrome in community care: people move from hostel to hostel and from one association to another, and do not have the stability and encouragement necessary to have their own homes and places in the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Council for the Single Homeless got it right when it, among others, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is essential that housing agencies in general are involved both in the planning of community services and the discharge arrangements for individual patients are early as possible in the process."</p></blockquote>
That is terribly important when we consider the implication of the announcement made this week by Greater Glasgow health board about the number of beds in its mental health units. I am not aware that the board consulted the Strathclyde social work department that will have to deal with many individual problems, the housing associations or anybody. Given that the Government, in their recent White Paper, accept that 90 per cent. of the 50,000 mentally handicapped people in Scotland might more reasonably be in the community, Ministers ought to tell us if they see a relationship between such decisions by health boards and the problems of homelessness in the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I echo the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart about the great Scottish issues of homelessness, waiting lists, dampness and so on. Some of the flowery documents that we see issued by the Scottish Office hardly reflect reality as ordinary people experience it. In the days when there was a Scottish Affairs Select Committee we went to Aberdeen and investigated the problem of dampness. Generally, Aberdeen has a fine record, as the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) will agree, but nevertheless we saw some bad examples of poor Scottish housing. What worries me, and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0286">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
it says a lot about our industrial heritage, is that they were within a few miles of where billions of pounds worth of oil is being extracted by the oil industry. That money is not being returned to the community, and in that a wider sense the people of Scotland deserve more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I end by referring to my distinguished predecessor, Jimmy Dempsey, much loved by many members of this Committee. He fought hard to improve housing conditions in the constituency. He was aware, as I am, that many of the problems that we faced and are still facing arise from industrial patterns. It was no surprise to me when I first became a young councillor and found appalling housing conditions that one of the biggest problems was called Stewartsland, so called because it was created by Stwarts and Lloyd, the steel company. Stewarts and Lloyd thought that those conditions were good enough for our people; they were not then and they are not now. Jimmy, in his rather couthie style used to recite a few lines, saying,
	<br><blockquote><p>"The rich man lives in a palace grand built by the poor man's labour.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The poor man lives in a single end with his feet in his next door neighbour's."</p></blockquote>
There is a serious point there: just as John Wheatley was committed to a dream—a house and a garden for all of our people—today there is a clear objective and challenge for us to ensure that the housing needs of all our fellow citizens are met. That will not be the case until a Labour Government are in office, and that cannot be far off.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Kennedy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ross, Cromarty and Skye)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like other members of the Committee, I thoroughly enjoyed and would happily endorse everything that the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) said, until his final sentence. With the exception of that, I pay tribute to his speech and the authority that he brings to the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to comment on the Minister's opening remarks. It was appropriate that he began by speaking about homelessness, because those of us who recently met the lobby from National Sleep-out Week, which lobbied at the House of Commons, were left in no doubt about the seriousness of the problem of people sleeping rough in this area. The most depressing aspect for me was the number of young people who had Scottish accents and English regional accents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the Scots who have ended up sleeping rough on the streets of London have come here because of the lack of opportunity in Scotland. With the recession—the second time round, under this Government—now striking the south of England, the problem has been compounded because more youngsters from that part of the country are moving to London. They did not have to do so before because there were opportunities in the Basingstokes, Readings and Milton Keynes's of this world, which now are not available to the same extent. There is, therefore, a double effect on many of the young Scots who find themselves in London and homeless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister announced at the beginning of his speech that additional cash would be made available to voluntary organisations and others to deal with the problem of homelessness in Scotland. As he mentioned the problem of homeless Scots in London, it is worth remembering that the £150,000 allocated over three years for Scotland must be set against the money that the Department of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
Environment has recently made available to deal with the problem in London—£3 million. That puts in context the degrees of financial commitment being exhibited by the Scottish Office and its counterparts dealing with the problem south of the border.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to raise one or two matters arising from Scottish Homes. My party colleagues and I were pleased to meet Sir James Mellon recently to discuss some of the strategies that have been adopted and some of the initiatives that are being undertaken. The original Scottish Homes document was entitled, "The Rural Housing Challenge". Notwithstanding some of the barbed remarks that have occasionally been made about some of the crofting schemes, it was pleasing to note that, after years of criticism from various quarters about the subsidies that have been given to crofting communities, they are now regarded by Scottish Homes as
	<br><blockquote><p>"the model for assistance for local self-builders."</p></blockquote>
It is important to establish that, and let us hope that the scheme can be extended outwith the parameters of the crofting counties to other parts of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is much to be commended in the work of Scottish Homes, but problems still exist and they are not all problems of funding. Although funding is the general weakness that runs through the entire structure, other difficulties must be dealt with. Some of the comments emanating from the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) are fairly typical. The Lochaber housing association has told him and other highland representatives that the bureaucratic machine is extremely slow in dealing with Scottish Homes. That may be due partly to resourcing and pressure of work, but Scottish Homes does not appear to be streamlined in terms of the number of assessments, reassessments, re-evaluations and so on that each scheme must undergo.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, there is the thorny question of the number of holiday homes that one increasingly encounters in areas such as the highlands. That, and the in-built difficulties of the rural housing market, make an already bad situation worse, especially for the lower end of the age spectrum. Since the explosion several years ago in property values in the south of England, many people have sold up and moved to Tayside, the highlands, the borders or the north-east of Scotland. They bring greater purchasing power because of the inflated house prices in the south-east and have driven up prices in an already pretty tight housing market, in which homes are scarce. That puts a lot of property in the north and rural areas totally outside the reach of young couples on moderate incomes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish Homes, alas does not seem to be able to do much about the historical problem of land. As the Minister knows, it is extremely difficult for local authorities to secure land for the construction of new public sector housing. Councils, like those in Ross and Cromarty or Skye and Lochalsh, with whom I have most dealings, have been imaginative in trying various, flexible schemes. They buy properties that come on the market if they can afford to do so—of course, local authorities cannot always afford to do so—and they try to convert rather than to build from scratch. The latter is more expensive on the west coast and on the islands because of transportation and infrastructural costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The central problem remains the horrible combination of property prices—which have been driven up by the influx of people mainly from the south, who have higher
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0287">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
spending powers—and the shortage of available land for housing, preventing young couples from entering the housing market. Until we address that problem, especially in rural areas, we shall not overcome our present difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that land can be zoned for low-cost housing?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am aware of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish Homes should appreciate that greater emphasis should be given to local connections in housing people. My hon. Friend the Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie) has made that point most vocally and volubly elsewhere, and has raised a head of steam about it. It is difficult to do that when one operates in a marketplace. However, when the idea was proposed by Lochaber housing association, Scottish Housing said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the bottom line surely in housing is housing need irrespective of local connection/family connection."</p></blockquote>
The principle that the market must have its place is all very well, but it gets distorted by people's experience that there is little point or sense, from the Government's or anyone else's point of view, in encouraging housing associations to find imaginative ways of bringing more property onto the market at a sustainable level, if that property is taken by people for whom it was not intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Office has not spent time and money encouraging housing associations to do something about housing people from the south-east of England. It is motivated to help people who are already stuck in Scotland and unable to get a house. The problem is the very success of the market. All too often, purchasing power is what counts. Those outwith the area take advantage of schemes that were designed to help those in the area. I should appreciate the Minister's response on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Understandably, housing is considered in terms of the problems of the local authority sector. All hon. Members have in their constituencies endless housing problems: renovations, improvements and repairs are needed and there is a shortage of new build and so on. That is one aspect of the problem. Another aspect is the consideration of housing in a wider context. Great strides have been made in the health of the nation and emphasis is placed on prevention. Sadly, Scotland still lags behind on health, doubtless because we have such a dreadful health Minister in Scotland. I am sure that that is why the indices on health in Scotland are not so good. Some of the greatest single improvements in health that have been made in Britain this century have been achieved not through health policy but through housing policy, clean water, better working conditions, an improvement in diet and so on. We want to improve some of the dismaying statistics on personal health that we still have in Scotland, and an individual's personal environment is all-important in achieving that. There should be greater emphasis on improving our public housing stock.

In terms of the problems of employment and of long-term energy resources, much could be done, by pump priming from the centre, to encourage many more home
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
insulation improvements in Scotland's housing stock, which given the climate, is woefully equipped for conserving energy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In debates in the House, on other matters related to Scotland, I have raised the problems that Ross and Cromarty district council has experienced because of the way in which the statistical section of the Scottish office calculates the indices that determine the amount of housing support grant, revenue grants and so on that the council is given. The indices do not take adequate account of the special problems of a rural authority such as Ross and Cromarty. As the Minister will know, there have been anxieties about that, especially the calculation of housing support grant. I have detailed those anxieties in letters, speeches and questions to the Minister. The great anxiety that has now arisen in the district is due to that four-letter word, BCCI, and the loss of the £1·8 million that the council had on deposit with the bank. The convenor and chief executives of the council and others have recently reported that they are hopeful that, because the £1·8 million was part of a total portfolio of almost £80 million, the council will not have to increase the poll tax in future and that, despite the need for painful cuts, it will not face the scale of difficulties faced by, for example, Western Isles council.

I have communicated with the council on its housing problems over new build and the restraints on its renovation, repair and refurbishment programme, which are already so tight that much of the work has to be put back. A further squeeze is inevitable, because of the loss that the council has sustained. Conflicting signals on the issue have emerged from the Scottish Office over the past week, and I hope that Scottish Ministers will deal sympathetically with local authorities in Scotland that have sustained losses and now have to revise budgets—not least for housing—that have already been pared down. Will the Minister make some acknowledgement of that difficulty and show that he is willing to listen to and consider the serious problems that are faced by local authorities? It would be appreciated, certainly by Ross and Cromarty district council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumfries)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief as other hon. Members wish to speak. There is no doubt about what was said by the hon. Members for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) and for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy). The correspondence that we receive and the problems that we hear from our constituents are most frequently about housing. Until we can overcome that problem, we shall never achieve what we all want to see—a vastly higher standard of housing availability for all. On the other hand, it is not all bad news, as even the hon. Member for Monklands, West recognised. Scotland has some good housing development, and sheltered housing is of exceptionally good quality. Older houses are also being reconstructed, which is more good news. We are making good progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The attitude of Opposition Members, who tried to deride the good speech made by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State with responsibility for housing, was quite misplaced. He is right to recount the Government's successes in housing. We should all accept that no Minister has taken greater trouble to travel round many areas of Scotland to meet housing committees, local authorities and others who are concerned about housing.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0288">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
Whenever possible, he has tried to meet their requests and demands. He has made an outstanding contribution to Scottish Grand life since he became a Minister. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State was also right to highlight the change in Scottish housing whereby 51 per cent. are owner-occupiers after the great success of council house sales. I hope that we shall now make further progress with the RTM scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members' attitude towards building societies—seen as great ogres waiting to repossess houses—is wrong. The last wish of a building society is to repossess houses. It is expensive and brings them the further difficulty of having to sell the properties themselves. In fact, they spend a great deal of time counselling and trying to help people through what may be only a temporary difficulty. Sometimes people can retain their house and delay mortgage repayments. We need to retain a proper perspective: only a small percentage of houses owned under a mortgage scheme are repossessed—half of 1 per cent., which is a very small proportion indeed. We should be complimentary to building societies for what they have achieved in difficult economic circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries all of us is that although there are more houses than ever in Scotland, waiting lists go up and up. There is a greater expectation now that a house should be available, either in the private sector or the local authority sector. We have underestimated the recent change in social circumstances and attitude towards the possession of rented or owned houses. That is what makes the difference significant. Why is it that the waiting lists in Scotland have gone up so dramatically while the total number of houses has increased? Why has homelessness increased? Why are more young single people wanting houses? Over recent years, we have witnessed a different attitude towards housing and we must meet the new demand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members blandly say that the problem is due to the economic situation and unemployment, but it is not. We should recognise that until about six months ago, Scotland had seen a dramatic fall in unemployment over the preceding three years. Yet although unemployment was falling, the requirement for homes increased, so there is no direct link between high unemployment and increased demand for housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to do anything in the short term—we must not go on year after year expecting that the construction of new houses will be the answer—we must examine other ideas, principally, houses to rent. My hon. Friend will say that we have made important changes to tenancies and shortholds and the like, but in the day-to-day business of letting, it is difficult to be certain about being able to repossess in the years ahead. A much more simple method would be to let a house for one, two or three years with certainty that the owner could repossess, without the problems of going to a sheriff and of the tenant having to find alternative accommodation. That way, much more accommodation at modest rents would be available more frequently for the public. I ask my hon. Friend to reconsider a simple form of tenancy that would ensure both that the owner regained possession at a fixed time and that the tenant knew his position. This way many more people would be housed much more quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must mention briefly the success of Scottish Homes, with its emphasis on rural housing. Many have praised Sir James Mellon. He is a refreshing newcomer to housing who has achieved great success. The hon. Member for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
Ross, Cromarty and Skye was right to say that one problem is planning for housing, especially in the countryside. There is often far too much restriction, but if we do not build houses of the right quality and design in the right places, children will not live there and schools, village halls and churches will suffer. We must accept that houses have to be built in the countryside. I am delighted at the initiative of Scottish Homes which set out to do just that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In acknowledging what Scottish Homes has done, we must say also, "Well done!" to the housing associations and to the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations. There is no doubt that excellent and significant housing—sheltered and other—has been provided by housing associations at low rents. I pay particular tribute to Loreburn in my constituency which is the front runner in this respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge my hon. Friend not only to keep up what he is doing, but to encourage Scottish Homes to build as much as it can in the countryside, in addition to what it is doing in urban areas. There are in the pipeline approximately 410 houses up to 1993 in Nithsdale. That is a significant number to add to the housing of what is a relatively small district council compared with authorities in the central belt. All power to the Minister. I thank him for his valuable information and for his ideas for the future. They at least, were positive whereas the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) was totally negative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.18 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sillars</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall comment on two matters. The first is the method by which the Government could immediately produce a solution to the financial problems facing district council housing authorities in Scotland because of capital debt. The second, just as important, is the Government's approach to the root cause of the housing crisis that have been a fact of Scottish life for as long as I have been a member of Scottish society. The Government must look at the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The housing capital debt in Scotland amounts to £3·7 billion. If it was written off, as I have urged the Government to do, it would transform the housing finance of Scottish district councils. It would allow a flow of resources from rent into housing, rather than into the pockets of moneylenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an Adjournment debate, the Minister rejected my argument. Speaking about capital debt, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As the hon. Gentleman is aware, it amounts on average to £6,700 per house, which is well below the value of the housing stock on the basis of right-to-buy sales, which is about £19,000 per house. There is therefore no evidence that Glasgow's capital debt is excessive in relation to the capital value of the assets with which the debt is associated."— [	<i>Official Report,</i> 5 June 1991; Vol. 192, c. 387.]</p></blockquote>
The implication is that if Glasgow really wanted to solve its capital debt problem, it could sell its assets at £19,000 per house. Of course, that is only a notional figure and if Glasgow did that, a vast number of people would be without housing. The Minister knows that that is nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I suggest wiping off £3·7 billion of Scotland's housing capital debt, up go Tory hands in horror and they say what a dreadful thing to anticipate. They had no bother in writing off £4·9 billion of capital debt when it came to privatising the English water authorities, or £3·4 billion to privatise British Steel. In a sense, ye canna expect much better from a Tory Government. I thought that we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0289">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
would get better from the Labour party, but I was disappointed to read in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> that a Labour spokesman described my suggestion as "unrealistic".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is about the root cause of the housing crisis. We cannot discuss housing without discussing the economy—how we allocate resources, how wealth is created by adding value, how assets are created that themselves create further wealth-creating assets. Housing contributes to economic health. Housing is not simply a way of spending money; if one brick is put on top of another, value has been added. If many bricks are laid to build a house, considerable value is added to the basic materials. Housing contributes significantly to wealth creation and asset building. The solution to the housing problem depends on how we allocate our resources and how we invest in our society. If we allocate resources productively, the chances of more resources being generated that can adequately tackle the housing crisis improve dramatically. If we misallocate our resources, we make it much less likely that we shall solve the housing problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus, I come to the misallocation of resources. Most seriously, money is poured into the armaments programme, where no value is added to it. I specifically refer to the Trident programme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman must bear in mind that we are discussing housing in Scotland. Wider issues, such as defence, do not enter into the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sillars</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With due respect, Mr. Hogg, if money is spent on Trident sumarines, there is less money to spend on housing, so there is a direct relationship.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That has a certain logic, but there is no end to that argument because money is spent on everything that the Government do. That then leaves us discussing the entirity of Government activity, the excuse being that everything is voted for by way of estimates. Perhaps it is regrettable that we did not have our debate on the estimates. If we had, the hon. Gentleman might have had wider scope. I counsel him to remain with housing and housing alone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sillars</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must take you up on that, Mr. Hogg. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] I am making a reasonable point. Indeed, the Labour Front-Bench spokesman said that there would be growth in the economy, without increasing taxation, and from that growth some money would be redirected into housing. I do not know whether you, Mr. Hogg, were in the Chair when the hon. Gentleman said that, but there is no difference in principle between his arguing that a Labour Government would produce economic growth part of which would be directed into housing, and my arguing that money would be far better spent on housing than on Trident submarines on the Clyde.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not wish to defend what a member of the Committee has said and I certainly do not intend to defend what the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) said, beyond saying that he was making a general point about the totality of growth in the economy. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Sillars) is referring to a specific Treasury expenditure policy, for which the Minister who is to reply to the debate has no responsibility. Therefore, the hon. Gentleman's
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
remarks are not relevant to the debate. As he has effectively made his point about Trident, perhaps he will now proceed with his speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sillars</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Hogg, but I consider that my point is relevant. I accept that the Minister has no direct responsibility for the MIRAS system, but if it is in order for him to mention mortgage payments and the MIRAS system, it is in order for me to argue that the misallocation of money on armaments will produce a deleterious effect on the economy. That, in turn, will make it extremely difficut, nigh on impossible, to mobilise resources for housing. I do not expect anything better from the Tories, but I expect something better than that from the Labour Front Bench. Its allocation of resources policy demonstrates that the Labour party would prefer to spend money on nuclear bombs than on housing the folk in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Irene Adams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) on his most eloquent speech; it covered most of the points that I wish to make. I was not sure whether the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) was commenting on housing or whether he was rewriting "Holy Willie's Prayer". He seems to forget that, because there are not enough houses to go round, people at the bottom of the pile are scrambling for the houses that are left. He seemed to be advocating a redistribution of poverty and arguing that he and the rest of us should pick out the people who best deserve houses and leave the others to scramble for themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The nub of the hon. Gentleman's argument was that housing was a redeemable asset and that it was something that people should pass on to their children. Opposition Members argue that housing is a basic human right. Scotland has a terribly cold climate. If its people were not housed, they would probably die because they could not live in that environment without a roof over their head. Housing must be a basic human right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are not enough houses to go round. There has not been any growth in public sector houses or enough house building, and ordinary people, especially the young, have been denied access to the small number of houses that have been built. Young couples have been forced to hang a huge mortgage around their necks, thus having their youth stolen from them. In the years when they should be enjoying life, they are saddled with huge mortgage payments. Because of the Government's high interest rate policy, people have been unable to pay such mortgages. If they lose their jobs, they will be unable to pay their mortgages and they will lose their homes. They will then be put back on the lists of local authorities which do not have the houses to meet requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need reasonable access to housing for all people, not just for specific categories, although young people have been especially badly hit. We have all had surgeries with queues of people at the door who have reasonable cases and who ask for very little in life. All they usually want is a roof over their heads—probably a two-bedroomed house. That is not a lot to ask for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I welcome the £120,000 for Ferguslie Park, it is rather like prescribing an elastoplast for a haemorrhage. The housing there is of such poor quality that it should not be called housing. An empty shell is not a house; it is an empty shell. The Minister should realise that 15 years ago
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0290">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
17,000 people were registered to vote in Ferguslie Park whereas there are now only 3,000 people registered to vote. The houses that he referred to are not replacing houses that have been lost; they are refurbishments of existing houses, so they will not add to the present stock.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of my constituents live in dreadful circumstances—dampness is just one of the problems that they face. Men, women and children live in abysmal circumstances in houses that were badly designed by architects for schemes that were badly designed by town planners. Those architects and planners never had to live in such houses. In the days when those houses were designed and built, few architects and planners came from working class homes on over-large council estates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to clumsy mistakes made by architects and planners, local government and central Administrations made dreadful mistakes. Many of my constituents still live in the houses mistakenly called homes. In fairness, most local authorities today have sought to introduce a more sympathetic and considerate system of housing management, but tenants, understandably, remain suspicious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister examine the conduct of the senior officials of Scottish Homes towards my constituents who live in such disgraceful circumstances? Scottish Homes is not doing enough for the remarkably successful housing associations in my constituency, nor for other bodies' tenants. Scottish Homes needs to be much more sympathetic and considerate to housing associations and council tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister tell us the present position of Gourock ropeworks in Port Glasgow? Elsewhere in Scotland derelict industrial buildings, such as Baxter's Mill in Dundee, have been converted—I would say transformed into remarkably fine homes. We could achieve the same objective with the Gourock ropeworks. The owner of that property ought to roast in hell for what he is doing with it. I appeal to the Minister to do something about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In an equally excellent speech, my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, North (Mrs. Adams) dealt effectively with the nonsense put forward earlier by the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) who, as I understood him, said that the homeless should be divided into deserving and undeserving cases. He suggested that only the deserving cases should be given access to public

The hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Sillars) said that he was deeply disappointed with the Labour Front Bench. I do not know whether he includes me, but I want to deal briefly with his point about writing off the £3·7 billion of capital debt that is owed by local authorities. The problem with that idea is that that money will be spent on the housing account in Scotland without a single house being built, improved or modernised. No rewiring, double glazing or dampness problems would be tackled, and nothing would be done to alleviate the housing position. The capital debt burden that housing authorities carry should be reduced, but it should be reduced by increasing the capital allocations to those housing authorities. That would enable them to pay off their debts over a longer period, and is more sensible than the big bang approach suggested by the hon. Member for Govan. He would give £3·7 billion of scarce resources to the moneylenders without releasing the money—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main speech this morning came from the Under-Secretary of State. I listened carefully to what he said and I was tempted to say that the Government could be accused of not having a housing policy for Scotland. However, that would be unfair, and I always try to be fair, in particular to the Under-Secretary of State who, although not the best of a bad bunch, is the least offensive of a bad bunch on the Conservative Front Bench.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government clearly have a housing policy, but it is the wrong one and it is directed at the wrong housing targets. The Government are obsessed with the idea of tenure change, in particular, to change from the public sector to the private sector. The change from the public rented sector into the private owner-occupier sector is the Government's overriding obsession in housing policy, almost to the exclusion of all other housing policy issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of my hon. Friends once described the Government's housing policy as a one-club housing policy. He was slightly unfair in that description because the Under-Secretary has a whole range of clubs at his disposal. He has the right-to-buy scheme, the rent-to-mortgage scheme, the choose-a-landlord scheme, the tenants' incentive scheme, the abandonment by Scottish Homes of its landlord responsibilities scheme, the withdrawal of housing support from the public rented sector, and so on. In fact, it could be argued that the Minister has a full set of irons and woods in his bag, but they are all in the one housing policy bag and they are all designed to have the same effect. They deny genuine housing choice to the people of Scotland and drive Scots in the direction that Ministers have decided that they should go whether or not they want to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Free choice in housing is a concept that is entirely alien to the Government. They are much more at ease with the choices offered to people by the Corleone clan. The Government make people housing offers that they cannot refuse. They say, "Buy your public sector house and receive a discount on average of £15,000. Move out of your public sector house and receive the incentive of a cash payment of £9,000. Stay in your public sector house and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0291">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
your rents will go up. Further, because of cuts to local authority funding, your repair and maintenance services will deteriorate and your chances of any housing improvements are nil." The Minister has the gall to come here this morning and say that a main strand of the Government's housing policy is to increase choice in housing. What kind of choice is that? It is no choice at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning, the Minister's speech focused on homelessness. I entirely accept that homelessness has been a problem for the Government in recent months. The sight of youngsters wandering the streets at night, vulnerable to all kinds of horrors, the spectre of cardboard cities and the absolutely shocking statistics from Shelter and others reveal the rising tide of homelessness across the country and have naturally put Ministers on the political defensive. Indeed, the Minister tried to cope with that this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People understand that those who are forced on to the streets through poverty are interested in only one kind of tenure change—the change from being homeless to having a home of their own. Yet, no direct incentive schemes are available to the homeless to help them to achieve that change. There are no cash payments for them, no handouts of £15,000 or £9,000 or any other sum. Indeed, there is no Government policy worthy of that name to tackle the problems of the homeless. This morning, the Minister spoke of a campaign and a programme. That is based on the idea that it will cost the Government the absolute minimum; it is an attempt to shift the burden of deling with the homeless on to others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard that £150,000 is available for advice and education to the homeless through the voluntary organisations. I remind the Committee that that sum is to be spent over three years. It is the equivalent of one house being built in Scotland in each of those years. That puts the matter into context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard about Scottish Office research into homelessness in Scotland. The Scottish Office produced a leaflet which gives this memorable advice to the homeless:
	<br><blockquote><p>"if you are homeless, contact your housing department".</p></blockquote>
How would the homeless have known that without the benefit of a leaflet from the Scottish Office? There is also a research study into empty public sector housing in Scotland. Yet there is no serious attempt to tackle the root causes of homelessness and what Shelter describes as the essential public housing issues of the late 20th century which affect the poorest people in our society. That means a supply of decent houses to poor people at prices that they can afford.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The homeless, the poor and the tens of thousands who are trapped on council waiting lists do not need research studies or leaflets; they need houses. They require funds to be released to local councils to enable those councils to build the houses that are needed. But the Minister patently failed to tackle that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether hypocrisy is a parliamentary term, Mr. Hogg, but it conveys exactly the stance of those who mouth concern for the homeless yet do nothing whatever to help them, even though they could do so. Homelessness rises and waiting lists grow longer in Scotland, yet this Government have cut in real terms the funding to Scottish housing authorities and to Scottish Homes, Scotland's national housing agency. Shelter
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
pointed out that there were fewer housing opportunities at the beginning of the 1990s in Scotland than there were at the beginning of the 1980s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Actions have consequences, but so does a lack of action. The failure of this Government to tackle the housing problems of the less affluent in our society has created homelessness and the housing crisis in Scotland. There is no doubt in the mind of any Opposition Member where the fault for that lies. It lies with the guilty men who inhabit the Government Front Bench and who, for 12 years, have completely ignored the housing needs of the less affluent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is pathetic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is really pathetic is how the Government have handled housing policy in the past 12 years. They are responsible for that policy. The fact that there is a crisis is down not to Opposition Members, but to those on the Government Benches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about the improvements in Dundee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the hon. Member for Tayside, North comes from Dundee, although Dundee tries to keep that a secret as best it can. In his speech, he referred to my constituency and to the dramatic improvements in council estates there. The major housing improvements in Dundee have taken place on the Whitfield estate, which happens to be one of the four partnership areas in Scotland. As the hon. Gentleman pointed out, money has been made available in Whitfield by central Government. There has been a series of housing initiatives in that area. Whitfield has three housing co-ops, housing association and private developments, council improvements and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem with that Government policy is that it is confined to Whitfield in Dundee. The other areas mentioned by the hon. Gentleman Mid-Craigie, Linlathen, Fintry, Douglas and Mill o'Mains—are being starved of Government money. Those areas' problems are getting worse—disrepair, dampness, overcrowding and growing waiting lists, which affect most of the services in Dundee. If the hon. Gentleman drove round Dundee, he would know the truth. The last word to use to describe the Government's housing policy in this area is "sensitive"—a term that he used four or five times in his speech. What is sensitive about leaving families to live in damp, overcrowded conditions year after year for want of investment? There is nothing sensitive about that, but that is what has happened under the leadership of the Under-Secretary of State responsible for housing in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish Homes was mentioned by the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) who praised its contribution to Scottish housing over the past few years. I can remember the Under-Secretary boasting, back in 1987, that Scottish Homes would operate like a housing Scottish Development Agency. Since the Government scrapped the SDA, he probably regrets making that comparison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However described, Scotland's national housing agency is the Government's key instrument of housing policy. Its work tells us a lot about the success or failure of the Government's overall housing policy. Shelter, which is in a better position than anyone here in Committee to understand the realities of Scottish housing policy, has no doubt about the performance of Scottish Homes: it describes Scottish Homes as particularly disappointing. It

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
points out that Scottish Homes is providing less rented housing than its predecessors, the Housing Corporation in Scotland and the Scottish Special Housing Association. Indeed, it points out that Scottish Homes has contributed to the scarcity of rented housing by selling off its stock as quickly as possible, and that it has used management agency agreements to force through stock transfers. Tenants have not been properly consulted about those changes; there is no legal right for tenants to insist on a ballot and no opportunity for them to determine who their landlord will be. So great is Shelter's anxiety, that it has called for an independent review of Scottish Homes' performance—a call which I personally support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Shelter is not alone in criticising Scottish Homes. The Scottish Council for Single Parents, the Tenants Information Service, the Federation of Scottish Homes Tenants and others are on record as expressing anxiety about the failure of our national housing agency to achieve what it was created to do: to make a substantial contribution to Scotland's housing needs.

The hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir N. Fairbairn) is unfortunately absent. Last Sunday, he published a newspaper article in which he argued that such success as Scotland has enjoyed in the past was as a result of Scotland not having any government. When I look at the individuals who hold the highest office in what passes for a Scottish Government—I sympathise with the hon. and learned Gentleman in the sense that Scotland does not really have a Government to speak of—at least I know that they will not always be there. Government can make a difference and offer an important contribution, but this sort of Government is not good enough. It takes a Scottish Parliament directly elected by the Scottish people and sitting in Edinburgh to produce the right sort of Government. When Scotland has such a Government, its housing crisis will be properly dealt with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I should point out that Shelter has praised Scottish Homes in certain respects. For example, one of Shelter's documents welcomed the fact that Scottish Homes had taken up leasing schemes in rural Scotland. Shelter would like to see that extended. It also welcomed the granting of approved landlord status to co-operatives in Grampian.

I have visited the constituencies of the hon. Members for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) and for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) and have seen Dundee's housing. The Whitfield regeneration has been a remarkable success, and will be seen through to a successful conclusion. Nor will it stop there. We are seeking to extend that approach to smaller urban renewal initiatives. Three towns have such successful initiatives—Kilmarnock, Alloa and Falkirk—and several more are under consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) said that he was not aware of any action in his constituency. Discussions are taking place, but I do not want to say any more at this stage as they are a matter for the local council in the hon. Gentleman's constituency and for Scottish Homes. I do not want to prejudice a successful outcome, which would be in his constituents' interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to congratulate Dundee on three points. The hon. Member for Dundee, East asked what was being done in Dundee. Today, in Dundee a strategic agreement is being signed between Scottish Homes and Dundee district council which will be of great benefit to the hon.

Gentleman's constituents. As I mentioned earlier, the council has speeded up its processing times for right to buy and adopted the voluntary sales approach which will enhance the receipts that it can spend on its public sector staff.

The hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Sillars) said that he wanted to write off millions of pounds of housing capital debt. That is unrealistic, as housing support grant is paid to those authorities that require assistance because of the large debts, especially where council housing has been built relatively recently. Glasgow receives £22·7 million in housing support grant. The hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman)—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sillars</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Under-Secretary give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the hon. Gentleman has had his chance. It sounded from his remarks as though the hon. Gentleman was about to close Rosyth. However, I am glad that that decision went the other way. We should return to the debate on housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall follow up the point made by the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow about the Gourock ropeworks. Not only is it a prestigous project but, possibly, it will be of considerable importance to housing in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sillars</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. There was such a noise a moment ago that I did not hear what the Under-Secretary said, but it has been relayed to me that he said that I want to close Rosyth. If the Under-Secretary made that accusation, I should like to say that it is not true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Sillars) raised a point of order. The hon. Gentleman thought that it was noisy down there, but it was even noisier up here. I have to confess that I did not hear a reference to Rosyth. If there were such a reference, it would fall foul of the Chair, as did the remark about Trident.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. Because of the noise, I failed to hear what might have been an important sentence or two uttered by the Under-Secretary about the Gourock ropeworks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order. I thought that it was the hon. Gentleman who was making the noise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg. I was absolutely quiet; I was listening to the Under-Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall follow up the point made by the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow about the Gourock ropeworks. We have had a meeting about the ropework. Developments are obviously important in that area. I shall give the hon. Gentleman the fullest information that I can as soon as developments occur.

Inverclyde's allocation was £8·3 million, which is available for spending on condensation and dampness. I am slightly surprised by the comments made by the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow about Scottish Homes' staff. Obviously, that is a mater for the hon. Gentleman to take up with the chairman of Scottish Homes. I am sure that Scottish Homes will be helpful.

The hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) raised questions about mortgage defaulters. We do not object in principle to a rent-to-mortgage scheme. I understand that Scottish Homes is considering such a scheme and is likely to give us detailed proposals in the autumn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) raised important points. He asked about the BCCI crash. The council in the hon. Gentleman's constituency should put its housing proposals to the Scottish Office. We shall consider its proposals in the context of supplementary allocations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On homelessness, we are in the business of prevention rather than cure. The addition which was announced this morning should be viewed in the context of the £3·5 million special allocations to eight authorities and the £9 million made available through urban aid in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike Watson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Under-Secretary give some thought to providing for young Scots who are homeless in London? At the moment, there is no provision for them through the Scottish Office. The Irish Government make available £500,000 for their young homeless in London. Is not it time for the Scottish Office to do something for our young homeless in London?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman, who has close connections with the Church of Scotland, should be aware that funding is being given to Borderline, which is operating in London. That funding is being given through the Scottish Office with the aim of prevention. I have seen what has been done and it is extremely impressive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cite an example of a problem that I encountered in a number of homelessness cases. I met a young Scot who said that it was impossible to live in the same house as his stepfather. It was not clear whether there had been physical violence, but that problem can result in homelessness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Substantial funding is being given to the urban programme and that will continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How much?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The final decision on the exact amount will be given in the autumn, but I told the hon. Gentleman about the sum of £9 million, £1·25 million of it for capital projects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Down here they are getting £73 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is aware that the chairman of Scottish Homes has made it clear that priority to homelessness will be given through Scottish Homes and the housing associations. That is absolutely right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) must not conduct a running commentary with the Minister, because other hon. Members cannot hear what he is saying. He may intervene in the Minister's speech. If he does not speak up, the debate will become somewhat one-sided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To respond to my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) and the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye, the development of the rural housing strategy is particularly
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
important. The principle on which we base our policy is the removal of housing deprivation wherever it arises in cities, towns or remote rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We authorised Scottish Homes to give grant assistance to the private sector for the construction of housing for owner-occupation and for the infrastructure costs involved in the provision of service sites. The additional £2·2 million which we made available to it for that purpose this year is on top of the £1·1 million announced last September and is evidence of our commitment to the improvement of rural housing. It is bringing forward 10 demonstration projects which are planned for different rural areas of Scotland. It is essential that Scottish Homes acts in close partnership with local authorities in pursuing those proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some formal agreements have been concluded between Scottish Homes and the relevant local authorities and two further agreements will be signed shortly. I confirm that the development of an effective rural strategy is well under way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries was unhappy about some aspects relating to the private rented sector. I advise him that a report is being prepared by the Scottish Law Commission on land tenure, and proposals will be published in due course. My hon. Friend said that planning in the countryside was too restrictive. I shall investigate the matter thoroughly and discuss it with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland to identify whether the problem is one of interpretation of Government circulars or whether there is a need for legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Monklands, West asked about community care. Scottish Homes will encourage associations to play a full part in developing strategies and any proposals will be considered. If the hon. Gentleman has constructive proposals, we should welcome seeing their details in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may, I shall proceed to answer other points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I intervene briefly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will have to be extremely brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will Scottish Homes and the Department meet the Greater Glasgow health board before the board continues with its proposals to reduce hospital beds for the mentally ill? That is a contribution to community care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a matter for my hon. Friend the Minister of State, and I have no doubt that he heard what the hon. Gentleman said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On assistance to deal with homelessness in Monklands, a capital grant of £21,000 was given and £100,000 was provided for current expenditure for short-stay refuges for adolescents. We are determined to meet the aspirations of the Scottish people by providing the types of housing which they need and want. It is an endless journey and akin to painting the Forth bridge—once one end has been finished, it is necessary to start again at the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are tackling the problems where they are worst. The fact that there are large numbers of strategic agreements with the major cities is a positive sign. Such agreements are being developed with almost half the local authorities in Scotland. I have no doubt that that will produce positive results.

About 8,000 housing unit starts have been made by Scottish Homes, including 5,000 new build for rent and 3,000 rehabilitations for rent. Earlier this year, a significant milestone was reached in Glasgow with the completion of the 15,000th house improvement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
