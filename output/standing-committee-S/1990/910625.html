Draft Building Societies Act 1986 (Continuance of Section 41) Order 1991</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. John Maples)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Building Societies Act 1986 (Continuance of Section 41) Order 1991.</p></blockquote>
When the Building Societies Act 1986 came into force, the Building Societies Commission was given a variety of powers to regulate the affairs of building societies. The Commission can revoke a licence, impose conditions, or instruct a society to seek a renewal of its authorisation by applying for a licence, as if the society did not already have one. Not all building societies were required to renew their authorisation when the Act came into effect, because that was felt to be an unnecessarily cumbersome and expensive procedure. However, being able to instruct a society to seek a renewal of its authorisation was felt to be a valuable transitional and regulatory provision.<br><br>
That power, which was originally given in section 41, was to last for five years once the Act came into effect. The commission found—and we agree—that that was a valuable regulatory power, enabling it to act in circumstances in which it would not want to take the high-profile step of revoking a licence or imposing conditions, but in which it would be appropriate to require a building society to take a serious look at the way that it runs its affairs and to deal with any weaknesses. The order will renew the effect of that section for a further five years.</span></p>
<p>10.33 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Eltham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are discussing control over the stewardship of the assets of building society members. I shall not oppose the renewal of the five-year power. We should consider the power in clause 41, and some of the powers in section 42.<br><br>
I hope to give an example, without straying out of order, that shows how it is possible for the commissioners to consider stepping in because of acts of omission, perhaps of commission by building society directors. I refer to the possibility that £250 million of members' money might be returned to building societies if the arrangements in clause 50 of the Finance Bill, which will be finalised before Report, are not enacted.<br><br>
I have done a fair amount of research into the Building Societies Act 1986, and I refreshed my recollection of the debate about some of those issues in the fifth sitting of the Standing Committee that considered the Finance Bill.<br><br>
For those who read that debate, I have two corrections to make to the <i>Official Report.</i> First, the Economic Secretary in 1985 was not my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Chope); it was my right hon. Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, North (Sir I. Stewart). Secondly, the quotation from my hon. Friend the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
Economic Secretary, who I am glad to see in his place for this morning's debate, came not from Volume 80 but from Volume II of the Standing Committee in 1984–85.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The reason why <i>Hansard</i> referred inaccurately—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I allowed the hon. Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley) to make his point. However, it is one neither of concern to the Committee nor of relevance to the order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Within the stewardship arrangements, we need to know how much money is involved. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Ecomomic Secretary for kindly answering several questions that I tabled over the past two or three months. On 21 June 1991, I asked my right hon. Friend the Chancellor to
<br><blockquote><p>"estimate the accumulated net receipts of income tax from building societies since 1985–86 and the amount affected by clause 50 of the Finance Bill 1991."</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend replied:
<br><blockquote><p>"Accumulated net income tax receipts from building societies for the six years 1985–86 to 1990–91 were £18,097 million, excluding those subsequently repaid as a result of decisions by the courts. Of these, an estimated £227 million would be repaid if clause 50 were not enacted." —[<i>Official Report,</i> 21 June 1991; Vol. 193, c. 341.]</p></blockquote>
The amount repaid to the Woolwich building society was about £70 million, give or take some interest.<br><br>
The directors of building societies, in their role as stewards, are in the position of having to contemplate not taking actions that the commissioners might think fell within section 41 of the Building Societies Act 1986, within which the order falls.<br><br>
I asked my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer in a written question whether he would
<br><blockquote><p>"list the dates beginning and ending the financial years for which building societies' payments of members' income tax in (<i>a</i>) January 1984, (<i>b</i>) January 1985 and (<i>c</i>) January 1986 satisfied the Inland Revenue and the dates beginning and ending the period of deduction of tax to which the 1985, 1986 and 1991 legislation and regulations are directed;"—</p></blockquote>
and whether he would add the information to a simple chart and place it in the Library. My hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to the Treasury replied:
<br><blockquote><p>"Payments of tax by building societies in January 1984, 1985 and 1986 under the former annual accounting arrangements satisfied their liability under those arrangements for the tax years 1983–84, 1984–85 and 1985–86 respectively.—[<i>Official Report,</i> 24 June 1991; Vol. 193, c. 372.]</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend also gave other information.<br><br>
I am not sure that the chart placed in the Library was the most helpful way of illustrating the sums that have, by decisions of the courts, been determined to belong to building societies and their members, rather than money that should stay with the Inland Revenue—as would happen if clause 50 went through without difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am being very tolerant, but the hon. Member is discussing clause 50 of the Finance Bill, which is improper in the context of the order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr Knox, for reminding me and the Committee of that. What I am about to say is not offered as a comment on your ruling—I was about to say it anyway.<br><br>
We are not today directly concerned with whether clause 50 is passed by the House. What worries us is whether the commissioners, using the powers that would lapse on 25
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0144">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
July if this order were rejected, would rightfully be able to call to account building society stewards or directors who fail to take all available action, whether or not clause 50 is enacted.<br><br>
It may assist the Committee in considering the possible renewal of section 41 of the 1986 Act to know that there have been four attempts by law to stop the stewards achieving what they believe to be right for their members.<br><br>
The first attempt was made in the 1985 Budget. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary for providing some of the clues to this sorry tale. I am grateful also to my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr Smith), who has shown more consistent interest in this matter than anyone else in the House, especially given the fact that the former Member of Parliament for Thurrock, Dr Oonagh McDonald, who also contributed to the 1985 and 1986 debates, is no longer a Member.<br><br>
The Inland Revenue press release of 19 March 1985 detailed the proposed special tax arrangements for building societies—one of the matters that the commissioners would have to consider when making a decision if section 41 powers were renewed. It stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"Societies will have to account quarterly for income tax in respect of interest paid to investors. The quarter periods will end on the last day of May, August, November and February, and tax will be payable 14 days later. These arrangements will come into effect on 1 March 1986; there will be transitional provisions to deal with the changeover."</p></blockquote>
No one reading that would assume that £250 million of extra taxation for 1985–86 was at stake. The chart placed in the Library—which building society directors and the commissioners would have to consider —make clear which years those payments cover.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Financial Secretary made plain in his answer what had already been said but less clearly and emphatically—that tax liability in the specific years had been extinguished. For those who are interested in such matters, that was one of the issues canvassed in the courts.<br><br>
The Red Book explained the financial consequences of various decisions. In table 4.2, of the Red Book for the 1985 Budget, under the category of income tax and corporation tax, I found the heading, "Building Society special arrangements". The "Forecast for 1985–86"—this is a direct effect of taxation changes—was nil. We can understand that. The
<br><blockquote><p>"Forecast for a full year"</p></blockquote>
was minus £20 million. Two pages on, note (h) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Reduction in corporation tax. The proposal brings forward payments of composite rate income tax within the financial year. This reduces the earnings of societies (and therefore the corporation tax on those earnings). There is also a reduction in the cost of funding the PSBR."</p></blockquote>
The commission might take the words,
<br><blockquote><p>"There is also a reduction in the cost of funding the PSBR"</p></blockquote>
as an oblique reference to the £250 million that would crawl out of building societies, reduce their members' assets, and turn up in the Inland Revenue. If that is how the Inland Revenue thought, in March 1985, that it was dealing with £250 million, I should be very surprised.<br><br>
We might expect the Treasury and the Inland Revenue to put the best possible face on what they do, but I cannot believe that the words,
<br><blockquote><p>"There is also a reduction in the cost of funding the PSBR"</p></blockquote>
referred to a conscious decision to bring £250 million of additional taxation and revenue—various judges have called it double taxation—into the Government's coffers. That would be incredible.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
I move on to what the commissioners would examine. This is perhaps for the sake of information if not simply for decision, although I think that it is probably for both. On 4 June 1985, in Committee on the Finance Bill, Oonagh McDonald, in discussing clause 38 stand part, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I have a couple of questions about the special composite rate arrangement for building societies which will come into force on 1 March 1986, when societies will have to account quarterly for income tax in respect of interest paid to investors instead of as at present, when, I believe, it is paid in January for the year in arrears.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>It will produce a minor cost for building societies in March next year, which, I believe, will amount to £50 million in a full year, spread across all the members of the Building Societies Association. I know that BSA members are not greatly worried about this but a point that occurred to me may not have concerned the Minister." — [<i>Official Report, Standing Committee</i> B, 4 June 1985; c. 299£300.]</p></blockquote>
She then spoke of the flow of funds and the availability of mortgages.<br><br>
In his reply, my right hon. Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, North (Sir I. Stewart), who was Economic Secretary to the Treasury between 1983 and 1987, did not correct that figure.<br><br>
When clause 38 of the Finance Bill 1985 was being considered, the Treasury either knew the figure or it did not. There is a subsidiary issue: either it had decided to opt for transitional arrangements that would draw in what my hon. Friend the present Economic Secretary to the Treasury calls the "windfall" or it had not.<br><br>
The only conclusion that the Building Societies Commission could reach was that there was no intention to mislead the House and that the £50 million that Oonagh McDonald mentioned was not queried by the Economic Secretary at the time because there was no question of an extra £250 million to come. That figure could have been easily calculated at the time, but it did not come up. The dog did not bark; the contradiction was not there. The only sensible and logical explanation—I shall not even call it charitable, because I believe that it is more straightforward than that—is that the Treasury did not know.<br><br>
The second question is whether, in June 1985, the Treasury intended to have transitional arrangements not for bringing in the quarterly payments but for drawing in additional revenue, so that £250 million of building society money could be grabbed. The answer must be that the Treasury did not have that intention.<br><br>
Incidentally, I have tabled some questions—I look forward to the answer—asking when thought was first given to drawing that money back. When I have those answers, I am sure that they will interest the whole House.<br><br>
The story continues, for the commissioners and for the trustees of building societies, to 17 July 1986. We had many, if not full, debates on the subject. That is why it may be sensible to have a fuller debate on the Floor of the House of Commons when the Finance Bill is considered on Report.<br><br>
However, that re-emphasises that on 17th July 1986, clear reference was made to the Leeds Permanent building society. We must ask what the directors of the Leeds Permanent, not the Woolwich, but other building societies are supposed to do now. Are they supposed to give up? Will the commissioners or society members expect them to do all that they can to benefit their depositors? We are, of course, talking about substantial sums, although they may not appear to be substantial in terms of the £18,000 million that the Inland Revenue received in building society interest tax since 1985–86. In fact, in comparison they are insignificant—amounting to only 1 per cent. of the total.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0145">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
For some building societies the figure may be equivalent to one third of their reserves.<br><br>
I reiterate the point made by many others, that the solidarity or the strength of building societies is not in question, but whether money should be repaid as a result of a court interpretation of Parliament's action. A building society director, and the commissioners would have to take account of, or at least hear, what my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary said—which is, that neither savers nor building societies are being taxed twice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spencer Batiste <span class='memberconstituency'>(Elmet)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend mentioned the possibility that the amounts that he mentioned could constitute one third of a society's reserves. If a society's reserves could be affected either upwards or downwards by payments in one year by as much as one third, does not that suggest that there was something odd about that year anyway?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is odd is that building society taxation, and its timing, was affected by the date of the end of the building society's financial year, and by when it paid interest to its members. There is one other feature, which I had forgotton, If one takes an average index of 100, a building society might have to pay 25 per cent. more than the average, or 25 per cent. less.<br><br>
The purportedly effective 1985 change in the Finance Act, together with the 1985 regulations that were defective, or the introduction of the 1986 change to the Finance Bill at a late stage, or of clause 50, will treat building societies in a different way one from another. One reason why the Building Societies Association has not been as robust as it might have been is that two of its largest members—the Halifax and the Abbey National—were hardly affected, because of the dates on which their financial years ended. My hon. Friend was right to point out that building societies are affected in different ways.<br><br>
We are dealing with £57 million for the Leeds Permanent, and another £100 million plus for other building societies that are affected. In the end, it will depend on the commissioners, Parliament, and the answer to be given shortly by my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to question No. 111 on yesterday's Order Paper, on page 3798, in which I ask my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
<br><blockquote><p>"what consideration had been given at the time of the 1985 Budget to proposals for transitional arrangements to obtain the tax subject to the Woolwich case judgement and to Clause 50 of the Finance Bill; when the intention was first made public; and in which way."</p></blockquote>
That brings us to the tangential point, because it is not central to the consideration of section 41, of when Parliament was told what was in the Government's mind.<br><br>
When I was a junior Minister, and more junior than my hon. Friend, I once had to face a question from a Member of Parliament to which there were two answers. One was a long screed that would have clouded the issue in fog and words, and the second was an answer of only two sentences, which I gave—"I have made a mistake. I am sorry." I believe that the Government should say—and I attach no blame to my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary—that they were not open with Parliament in 1985, because in March 1985 they did not intend to take the extra £250 million, but during the year, perhaps the amount of expected revenue started to diminish due to the decline in interest rates and for other reasons. I cannot offer too much
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
detail on that aspect, because my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary says that it would be disproportionately expensive to know what proportion of the fall in tax receipts are due to volume, tax rate, or interest rate changes. Interest changes must have been the most significant.<br><br>
I suspect that clever people in the Treasury and the Inland Revenue might say, "No pound has been taxed twice, and there is the windfall. If we lose in court, at some stage, Ministers coud be advised, that they could treat it as if it were a tax appeal rather than a judicial review, and let the Woolwich"—or any other organisation involved in the appeal case—"through, and gather the rest by having a third or fourth change of law and regulations." That probably would not happen—and I cannot say what happened on the occasion in question because I was not at the Treasury at the time; nor, after this speech, am I ever likely to be there.<br><br>
Let us be plain. The courts held that there was double taxation; that it was retrospective; and that double taxation would be legal if there were an effective rate. There is no question about any of those points—except perhaps in the mind of my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary. We should accept that the concession of extra revenue—of additional taxation, double taxation—was mentioned by a number of judges, and none of the others disagreed.<br><br>
The Court of Appeal was asked to establish whether the Inland Revenue had the power under the Finance Act 1986 to do what it did—and the commissioners will be able to consider my arguments if we renew section 41 powers.<br><br>
I shall sit down in a moment, but not before commenting that for the past five years, the Government's actions have been the subject of judicial review. If section 41 is passed—as I am sure that it will be—and if clause 50 is adopted without significant amendments, then, as I told my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary on the Floor of the House about a week ago, composite rate tax arrangement assumptions will be altered. Some money will have gone through.<br><br>
We must know whether or not composite rate tax calculations are affected by clause 50, clause 38, or regulations 3 and 11 under the 1985 Act. The Government cannot have it both ways. A duty of stewardship or trusteeship on the part of building society directors will be affected—and that will mean going back to the courts and applying for another five years of judicial review.<br><br>
It is quite clear what should happen. Building societies, perhaps with the assistance of the commissioners, should get together with the Government and try to find a way forward that provides a measure of justice all round. It is not a question of repaying all moneys to depositors or members, or of introducing any other complications. It is a question of whether Parliament knew in 1985–86 what was going on. The answer to that is no.<br><br>
It is a question of whether tax payments on 1 January 1985 satisfied the Inland Revenue's requirements for the tax year 1985–86. The answer to that question, as my hon. Friend the Minister said, is yes. And it is finally a question of whether Parliament is willing to say to the Government, "We want to hold you to account. There was not full accountability in March or June 1985. There was only a hint of it by 1986."<br><br>
The Commissioners should require building society directors, under section 41, to continue their battle. I hope

that a solution can be found that is reasonably fair to the taxpayer and certainly fair to building societies.</span></p>
<p>10.55 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Section 41 of the Building Societies Act 1986 enables the commission to direct a society, in certain circumstances, to make an application to renew its authorisation. Will my hon. Friend the Minister explain what those circumstances might be? He may have explained this in his introductory remarks but I could not hear everything that he said. Will he make it clear why Parliament decided that section 41 should expire after five years and be subject to five-yearly renewal?<br><br>
I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley) on drawing the Committee's attention to the relationship between the provision in the Building Societies Act and the debate that took place in another Committee on clause 50 of the Finance Bill. Some building societies worked hard adequately to protect the investments of their shareholders and depositors, so there is no reason for the commission to intervene yet. My hon. Friend drew the Committee's attention to the large amount of building society cash—£227 million of depositors' money—that is at stake.<br><br>
My hon. Friend referred to the debate on the 1985 Finance Bill and said that, judging by what was said then by Dr Oonagh McDonald and the response by the then Economic Secretary, the Committee was unaware of what would subsequently happen. I agree. A reason for that, in addition to those that my hon. Friend gave, is that the Finance Act 1985 refers to 1986–87 and subsequent years and states that the Treasury will have power to make regulations —they were subsequently entitled the Building Societies Regulations 1986—that will refer only to 1986–87 and subsequent years. It is not surprising that the Committee did not appreciate that the provisions might hark back to previous years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend remind the Committee whether those regulations were laid in 1985 or 1986?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that they were laid in March 1986. That was the first real notice that the buildings societies had of the problem. Subsequently, the general manager of the Woolwich building society and I went to see my hon. Friend the then Economic Secretary to the Treasury. My hon. Friend said that the courts had ruled that there was double taxation. That is not quite right. The House of Lords ruled that the Finance Act 1986 has retrospectively given approval to what some people—but not my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary—would describe as double taxation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is important to cut down the areas of disagreement with my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield that the House of Lords and the Court of Appeal said that the Finance Act 1986 retrospectively authorised the regulations under the Finance Act 1985; made legal what was, in one sense, double taxation; and brought in extra revenue for a year in which the Inland Revenue had already been satisfied.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an accurate description of what was decided.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
One of the problems with our debate is that until my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary clarified the issues in an excellent speech during the Committee stage of the Finance Bill, it was not clear that a dialogue of the deaf was taking place. There were two different concepts of double taxation. The building societies were saying what my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary said in a parliamentary answer yesterday—that the income tax liability of building societies was completely fulfilled under the previous arrangements, while my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary said that no pound of building society interest was taxed more than once. My hon. Friend is right about that. I have no complaint about what he did, because he had nothing to do with the Treasury at the time.<br><br>
My complaint concerns what happened previously—in 1985 and 1986, when the matter was badly handled, and that it is not right to give retrospective approval now.<br><br>
As to renewal of section 41 of the Building Societies Act 1986, the Building Societies Commission will want to consider carefully, if the House agrees to clause 50 of the Finance Bill, how to react. It will want to continue the fight against the provision in the courts. The Building Societies Act 1986 states that those who run building societies have a duty adequately to protect the investment of their shareholders and depositors—I believe that they have an obligation to do so—and the Building Societies Commission will want to keep a close eye on that.</span></p>
<p>10.59 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Boateng <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brent, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: If there was the remotest possibility of the Economic Secretary rising in his place this morning, or at any other time, to utter the words, "I made a mistake; I am sorry", I have no doubt that our proceedings would be even better attended than they are because we would have landed in the world of H. E. Bates. I cannot envisage the Economic Secretary uttering those words, however justified they might be.<br><br>
You may believe, Mr. Knox, that those words do not need to be uttered in relation to section 41 of the Building Societies Act 1986. That mechanism, which is useful, innocuous and regulatory, had to be used only once and we are glad of that. Its advantage is that it enables the commission, which has responsibility for protecting the interests of investors and depositors, to question the viability and security of their deposits and investments, and to require a building society to satisfy the commission that relevant interests are protected. That provision is necessary and important for maintaining confidence in building societies and the regulatory mechanism. It was used in relation to the Peckham building society, in conjunction with section 42. That turned out to be justified and led to the successful merger of that building society, which was in the best interests of all parties. The Opposition do not intend to oppose the extension of section 41.</span></p>
<p>11.1 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the support of the hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng). He has difficulty envisaging me saying, "I have made a mistake. I am sorry." My hon. Friends the Members for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) and for Dorset, North (Mr. Baker) have no difficulty envisaging the hon. Gentleman saying that. He did so with considerable style during the Committee stage of the Finance Bill. He did not use those precise words, but that was the effect of his second speech on the same subject.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0147">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
As to the matter now before us, I deny that there was a mistake and if there was, I did not make it—so I have nothing to be sorry about.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield asked in which circumstances section 41 might be used. Such circumstances might be when there had been a substantial change in the nature of a building society's business and the commission did not feel that its directors and management had taken account of that—or felt it necessary to focus the attention of the board of directors on the way in which the society was being run.<br><br>
Re-application for a licence is an elaborate procedure, but not as dastardly as revoking a licence—nor is it of such a high profile as the imposition of conditions would be. For example, I believe that a condition was imposed on one building society that it should appoint a finance director.<br><br>
If there was a specific weakness, the commission might impose a condition to correct that weakness. If it believed that there was not a specific and imminent danger but a more general problem on which the directors' attention should be focused, section 41 might be invoked. Its use is not as drastic as revocation of a licence or the imposition of conditions, but it could be applied if it were thought that something needed to be done to strengthen management and procedures for financial control, to ensure that there was no danger to the society's funds in the long term.<br><br>
I was asked why the provision was for only five years in the first instance. Two thoughts were behind that. First, it was felt that might be a useful power for the commisson to have. Secondly, when the Banking Acts were introduced, all banks were obliged to reapply for licences but, after the Building Societies Acts, they were all grandfathered and it was thought to be unnecessarily cumbersome to make all of them go through the reapplication procedure.<br><br>
However, the Government thought that the commission should have an essential power to instruct a society to observe that procedure if it considered that necessary. It has been used only once, but there are more than 100 building societies—most of which were, I believe, in existence before 1986. Potentially, therefore, there are 100 building societies to which the provision could be relevant. From the viewpoint of transition, and of it being a regulatory power, it would be valuable to continue it.<br><br>
I cannot be as ingenious as my hon. Friends the Members for Beaconsfield and for Eltham in keeping within order a refutation of their arguments on clause 50. Therefore I shall not strain your patience, Mr. Knox, by trying too hard. We had an extensive debate at that time, and all the issues that anyone would have wanted to raise were raised. It is possible that the subject will be raised on Report —although I hope not.<br><br>
I ask my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham to reflect on two points. First, perhps if he had read the court judgments, he would not have concluded that the courts had held that the provision meant double taxation. Judge Nolan, in the court of first instance, reached that finding, but the Court of Appeal comprehensively reversed it, saying that there was no element of double taxation. The only reference to it was in the House of Lords, which decided four to one, on a technicality, that the Government had power to impose the regulations, but did not have power to tax the receipts in the gap period at 1985–86 tax rates, and that they could do so only at 1986–87 and 1987–88 rates.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
Having read all the House of Lords judgments several times, I conclude only that the decision turned on a technical point, and that there were no moral strictures on either party from either the Court of Appeal or the House of Lords. Even Lord Lowry, who delivered the dissenting judgment, said that he was not impressed by the arguments about double taxation or inequity.<br><br>
On the point about retrospection, it is common practice that where it is discovered that the tax law does not have the effect that the Government and everyone else thought it had, it is appropriate to restore the position to where it was. That is what we are doing. The debates at Report stage of the 1986 Finance Bill make clear what was intended.<br><br>
I shall conclude, so that my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham may speak again, if he wishes. The 1985 Inland Revenue press release could not possibly be taken to mean anything other than the situation that I described. The fact that increased revenue of £250 million was not reflected in the Red Book or elsewhere means that there was no increased revenue. My hon. Friend will no doubt pursue that point himself if he wishes to do so.<br><br>
In 1987–87, the Inland Revenue received £76 million less in tax receipts from building societies that it would have received had the old system continued, because a series of changes were made—only one of which was the bringing into tax of the gap period. Another change based the tax on interest payments to building society investors, rather than on interest accruals to them. The effect was that they conterbalanced each other in the aggregate, with the result that we received £76 million less revenue than if the old system had continued. It is not surprising that the Red Book did not reflect an increase in forecast revenue—because what resulted was a decrease. I do not think that the substance of the order is in dispute, and I commend it to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>11.9 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Economic Secretary invites me to reflect on section 41 of the 1986 Act. I do not want to become involved in a massive argument with him because, this is not the appropriate place, but some of the issues are relevant to the duties of the commissioners and building society directors.<br><br>
The Red Book gives forecasts for a full year, which show increases, and decreases of down to £1 million. If there was a calculation of £76 million—never mind £250 million—where was it printed? The answer is that the Inland Revenue did not declare it.<br><br>
There is also the question of the Economic Secretary's response to Oonagh McDonald in June 1985, when an estimated £50 million was given, which was wrong by 50 per cent.—£25 million. If we consider the estimate of £250 million, it was wrong by a factor of five.<br><br>
I appreciate that advice to Ministers is normally kept under wraps, but I am sure that my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary could clear up many problems by publishing any working papers shown to Ministers in 1985, at the time of the Budget, which showed some of the effects that I described and explicitly demonstrated that at the time that Parliament was told about the change—of no additional revenue—Ministers knew what was proposed.<br><br>
I am willing to wager a "I am sorry. I was wrong", admission if my hon. Friend the Minister is prepared to do the same. That would be a way of clearing up the problem. If there is a working paper showing a clear intention to opt
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V007P0I0148">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
for transitional arrangements to draw in an extra £250 million of tax in March and June 1985, we would be left only with the question of whether Ministers misled, or were not open with, Parliament. At the moment however, there is the additional question of whether Ministers themselves knew that £250 million was at stake.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Economic Secretary is a reasonable person, as I am. I am sometimes described as a semi-establishment man. I try not to cause rows—especially with my own side. I am, however, willing to do what Members of Parliament are supposed to do—to ask whether building society commissioners and the Inland Revenue have specific powers. Most building society directors might wish to take issue with what my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary has said—just as legal advisers did in an unprecedented letter to <i>The Times.</i>
The Court of Appeal decided that the Inland Revenue had the power to opt for additional taxation. There was no question of whether it was right or wrong that it should do so, but whether the retrospective changes to the Finance Act 1986 legally gave the Revenue power to do so. I agree that the House of Lords decided that the retrospective changes to legislation allowed the Inland Revenue to have a go, but that attempt could not succeed because there was no effective tax rate. I do not know whether it is right to call that a technicality.<br><br>
I must stress that the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords were not asked to decide whether it was right or wrong, in a non-legal sense, to try to collect extra taxation for a year in which the Inland Revenue, on the admission of Treasury Ministers, had been satisfied that the full tax liabilities of building societies had been fulfilled. That is the crucial issue.<br><br>
I want to pose eight simple questions for the commission and the building societies to consider—assuming that this order is passed. The first is, when was tax last paid under the old system? The answer is 1 January 1986. The source for that information is the Treasury.<br><br>
Question two is, what period of liability did the payment satisfy? The answer—again, according to the Treasury—is the Inland Revenue tax year 1985–86. The Treasury confirmed that covered the societies up to March 1986.<br><br>
Thirdly, what should the Chancellor have told Parliament in the 1985 Budget? He should have confirmed what my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary told us in a parliamentary answer yesterday—that revenue liability had been satisfied.<br><br>
The fourth question is, what did the then Chancellor say? He said that there would be no extra revenue, yet we know now that £250 million of extra revenue was generated by the transitional changes. The source of the Chancellor's statement is <i>Hansard</i>: The source for what he did not say is the press notice, and the Committee debates of June 1985 and others.<br><br>
The fifth question is, if extra tax was brought into the tax year 1985–86—that is taxed but not paid for that year—is that extra revenue, that extra tax, double taxation? I use those words interchangeably. The answer is clearly yes—to the amount of £250 million of extra tax —which many, including some judges, call £250 million of double tax. The source of that opinion is judges and counsel, as the transcript will show. I am still waiting for a parliamentary
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
answer about that. Building society advisers and directors are another source of that opinion—and common sense too.<br><br>
Question six is: how can the Revenue claim extra revenue or tax for part of the tax year 1985–86? The retrospective change in the Finance Act 1986 allows the Revenue to have a go at making such a claim, but the judgment of the courts is that Parliament authorised double taxation and the extra revenue. However, in 1985 the question was not put to Parliament in that way. The 1986 debates were inconclusive, and left the issue to the courts.<br><br>
Question seven is, what should the Government do, or say now? I have already suggested that no personal mistakes were involved, and that I appreciate the position of my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary. However, he could say, "A mistake was made. We are sorry. Let us talk."<br><br>
My final question is, need other societies have joined in the application for judicial review? The answer, judging by the Law Officers' comments and a written answer that I was given two months ago, is no. It is different from a clever tax dodge. It is an open application for judicial review to clarify the law. That was made clear during the Report stage of the 1986 Finance Bill.<br><br>
The Government should get away from the one good point that my hon. Friend makes —that not one pound has been identified as having been taxed twice, and ought to return to the solid point that the situation was not made clear to Parliament. The case of the Leeds Permanent building society, for example, was included in the debate on 17 July 1986. It should not lose its £57 million.<br><br>
Whether or not clause 50 is enacted, it would be wrong for building society directors to let the matter drop—and for the commission to let them drop it. There are few occasions on which I feel strongly about straight dealing by the Government. Normally, Governments can be accused of straight dealing, even when it hurts. On this occasion, because of the passage of time the changes in the Ministers involved, Parliament should go back to the beginning and say to the Government, "If you want an extra £250 million, or an extra £180 million,"— equivalent to between 1½ per cent. and 1 per cent. of building societies' receipts since 1985–86—"consult Parliament from the beginning." Let us scrap the sorry business of legislating year after year, and of having judicial reviews year after year, and let both the Building Societies Commission and society directors carry out their duties. Parliament should give them an open playing field, which enables them to understand what is going on."<br><br>
To call £250 million
<br><blockquote><p>"some effect on the public sector borrowing requirement"</p></blockquote>
is the most clouded curtain-pulling that I have seen in my 16 years in Parliament.</span></p>
