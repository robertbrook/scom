	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. David Madean)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Radioactivity in Sheep) Order 1991.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the agreement of the Committee, we shall also consider the Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Radioactivity in Sheep) (England) Order 1991 and the Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Radioactivity in Sheep) (Wales) Order 1991.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These orders have the effect of consolidating and replacing, with amendments, previous orders relating to post-Chernobyl sheep controls in England, Wales and Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main difference between the present consolidated orders and their predecessors lies in a rationalisation of mark and release arrangements by the introduction of a fixed timetable for what is now routine annual cycle of releasing certain cohorts of marked sheep from slaughter restrictions. While those arrangements follow a broadly similar pattern each year, the exact timing of the changeover from one colour mark to another has tended to vary, depending on market conditions and demand for remonitoring. However, experience of operating mark and release schemes over the past years show that the adoption of a fixed calender of colour changes is both practicable and helpful to all involved. Since radioactivity levels fall quickly in sheep once they have left the designated area, we are, after applying a generous safety margin, able to allow all animals in any colour cohort to be block-released three months or more after being marked and leaving the restricted area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since January 1991, therefore, the three different colour marks are applied during three fixed, four-month periods each year—apricot from January to April, green from May to August and blue from September to December inclusive. Article 6(2) of each order lays down a fixed timetable for release from slaughter prohibitions throughout the United Kingdom. Under that timetable, any apricot, green or blue marked sheep is automatically released from slaughter restrictions three months after the date that that colour mark was last used. However, owners wishing to have marked sheep released sooner must apply to have them re-monitored and ear-tagged in the normal way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those arrangements apply to sheep that one leaving the restricted areas permanently. However a fourth colour, red, is used to mark sheep temporarily leaving those areas, for breedingor over-wintering. As that colour is in constant use, and because red marked sheep may re-enter the
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
designated areas and become re-contaminated, red marked sheep are only released after being individually re-monitored and ear-tagged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have suggested, the differences between the new orders and their predecessors are largely technical. There is, however, one welcome change of substance—a reduction in the size of the English, Welsh and Scottish designated areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since 1986, we have been keeping a close watch on radioactivity levels, both by special monitoring surveys and by studing data from sheep live-monitored under mark and release schemes. I should like to put the scale of the problem into perspective. In England and Wales the number of animals failing the live-monitoring test under mark and release is very low indeed. For example, in Cumbria in 1990, less than 0·2 per cent., or 160 out of 106,000 sheep, failed the live-monitoring test. Those figures, together with our regular scientific surveys within the designated area, confirm that only a relatively small number of sheep is responsible for the continuing need for restrictions. The problem, however, is that those failures are not concentrated in a few flocks but are fairly widely scattered throughout an area of open fell with few natural or manmade boundaries, making it difficult to devise a simple system of progressive derestriction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased to say that our systematic approach to the collection of live monitoring and special survey data has enabled us to identify two well-defined sub-areas within the Cumbria restricted area which have produced no mark and release failures in the past two years and, therefore, no longer justify continuing restrictions. A similar situation exists in Wales and Scotland. To ensure that that conclusion did not rest on any adventitious feature of farmers' marketing practices, the Agriculture Departments in each country undertook an intensive scientific survey of all sheep in those areas last summer, during the months when radioactivity levels would be highest. Testing was carried out within 24 hours of the animals being brought down from the fells and demonstrated that radioactivity levels were low throughout those areas and that restrictions could safely be lifted from 23 complete and 16 part holdings in Cumbria, from six complete and 12 part holdings in Wales, and from 10 complete and three port holdings in Scotland. Those holdings and part holdings have therefore been excluded from the areas designated by article 3 of and schedule 1 to the orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power station in 1986, the Government have retained the strictest controls over the movement and slaughter of sheep from those upland areas most heavily affected by radioactive deposition. Our major aim has been to ensure that consumers remain fully protected at all times. At the same time, affected farmers have benefited, to date, from nearly £8 million in compensation to offset the economic effects of the controls. That is in addition to the considerable investment which we continue to make in Chernobyl-related scientific research and shows how seriously and responsibly the Government take all questions relating to the safety of our food supplies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to acknowledge the help and co-operation that we have received and continue to receive from the farming community. The present reduction and streamlining of controls is a positive development and will be welcomed by them and, I hope, by everyone here today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.37 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Martlew 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carlisle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was interesting to hear the Minister say how well the Government have dealt with the matter since spring 1986. The blame for the problem lies squarely with the Soviet Government, whose criminal neglect resulted in what is probably the worse disaster in the history of nuclear energy. The British Government were guilty not of criminal neglect but of incompetence, especially in the early days following the disaster. There is no doubt from the statistics that there will be an increase in thyroid cancer because of the Government's refusal to ban the milk which went to infants in those early days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was a member of the Select Committee on Agriculture which considered the matter. It is highly probable that some lamb entered the food chain in the early days and that some people ate the lamb that was, by the Government's standards, contaminated. That was a long time ago and if the Government were guilty of anything, they were guilty of complacency. The then Secretary of State for the Environment—the right hon. Member for Mole Valley (Mr. Baker) — said in May 1986 that the problem in this country would be over in a week, but he did not say in which year that week would be. Five years later we are discussing the release of some farms. We welcome that, but farmers in England, Scotland and Wales have had a traumatic time. As a Cumbrian Member of Parliament, I have talked to many of those farmers and have great sympathy for them. Their land was blighted and the stigma was related not to the quality of the farms but to Chernobyl. Many farmers were unable to sell land and those who wanted to retire have had to carry on farming because land values have decreased. Government compensation has not been generous. The Minister mentioned £8 million, but I hoped that he would expand on the possibility of increasing compensation for farmers who are still covered by the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Select Committee on Agriculture said that 66 farmers in Cumbria got "rough justice". A deal made between the National Farmers Union and the Government meant that those farmers were not adequately compensated and were excluded from the scheme. They feel greatly aggrieved. As far as I know, that injustice has not been put right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was a member of the Select Committee that interviewed the National Farmers Union in Carlisle. The Select Committee was unhappy with the Union's view. There seemed to be a pact with the Government to cover up the matter. The farmers who were excluded from the scheme were not well represented by the NFU.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister consider an increase in compensation for those farmers? Will he examine the situation of farmers who cannot sell their land? Will he also say when the order is likely to be lifted from the rest of Cumbria and parts of Scotland and Wales? It is five years since the Chernobyl disaster, and farmers need assurance from the Government that they will be fully compensated and that the order will be lifted as soon as it is safe to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.41 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martyn Jones (Clywd, South-West)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to carry on from the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Carlisle (Mr. Martlew). There have been five years of research and the Minister said that considerable sums of money had been spent on it. We know precisely
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
what the half-life is of the radionuclides and the areas covered. By now we should know the types of soils affected and the amount of contamination. I wish to press the Minister for a date when all the areas, especially those in north Wales will be free from contamination. The research should be able to show the timescale involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.42 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carmarthen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My wife comes from an area in north Wales that was affected. Her father is a hill farmer and was in the area at the time of the heavy rain that brought down the radioactive waste from Chernobyl. Why are the experts holding on to their assessment of the damage? When the restrictions were introduced several weeks after the radioactive contamination, we were told that they would be temporary and last only a few weeks, but they were renewed and renewed. Areas in north Wales are still restricted five years after the event. Why were the experts so wrong in their initial assessment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of the Farmers Union of Wales asked me about the practice of farmers in Wales—and probably Cumbria—of moving stock down from the moorlands to the lowlands when the scanner is due to call. The moorland soil is contaminated because it holds nutrients and has poor leaching characteristics. It retains strontium and caesium. There is not so much of a problem with lowland soil, given the heavy rainfall and the leaching of the surface water. Farmers in those areas have become wise to that, and when they know the date on which the scanner will call, the stock is moved from the upland soil to the lowland soil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of the Farmers Union of Wales was worried about that practice because he considered that, by moving the sheep from the upland to the lowland soil, contamination could spread through their faeces to the lowland soil. Will the Minister comment on that? Does the figure of 0.2 per cent., which he quoted, refer to the position when the fanners have been forewarned of the spot checks? If there were spot checks on just the affected lowland areas, the results might be different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members have made some valid points. However, I wish to slap down a couple of points which were completely inaccurate and which were simply raking over past history. It was not helpful of the hon. Member for Carlisle (Mr Martlew) to suggest that people will suffer a higher incidence of cancer because of the Government's failure to take action on contaminated milk. There is no suggestion whatever that that will happen. Such a statement would be the cause of an unnecessary scare if people took it seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to another myth that is dragged out time and again. The prinicipal Opposition spokesman on agriculture is always wrong when he argues that lamb was marketed in the early stages, that Chernobyl happened in May and that the Government introduced restrictions a few weeks later. He says that, in that intervening period, people scoffed a lot of lamb.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have tried to stress to the Opposition that contamination takes some time to build up. For people to have eaten lamb that was contaminated at that time, lambs no more than the size of rabbits would have had to be killed. I am not a native Cumbrian, but I have lived there long enough to know that my constituents in the Lake
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0474">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
district would not be killing and eating lamb of that size. We have been over the issue time and again, and that argument is not correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Carlisle referred to the stigma on Cumbrian, Welsh and Scottish lamb. The success of the Government's action to protect consumers can be measured by the fact that lamb sales have held up. If it were true, as the Opposition suggest, that the Government made a botch of that and did not protect the consumers, does anyone really think that the British media would not have exposed it? Would not the lamb market have collapsed? If the proposition were true, we would not, to this day, have been able to sell lamb. Despite the most rigorous scrutiny by everyone concerned—Members of Parliament and the British media—no one was able to point to dangerous lapses in the Government's efforts. British, Scottish, English and Welsh lamb is continuing to sell well and is appreciated by the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no cosy pact between the Governmetn and trade interests on compensation. Moreover, trade interests have been repeatedly knocking on the Government's door, suggesting alterations and variations to our compensation schemes. The Government introduced four separate tranches of compensation schemes—four different safety nets—to try to cover every eventuality. I accept that, no matter how many different compensation schemes we have, some people will fall through the net. There will be some hard cases. We have invited organisations, such as the NFU, the Country Landowners Association and the Tenant Farmers Association to make proposals. If they can come up with any just scheme for additional compensation or compensation for those who have slipped through the net, we will be happy to consider them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also have a duty to the taxpayer not to continually introduce new compensation schemes under which everyone else will try to benefit. The hon. Member for Clwyd, South-West (Mr. Jones) referred to dates. I cannot and will not estimate when the period will be over. I shall ask the House to lift the last order when I am sure that it is safe to do so and that consumer interests are protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should point out to the hon. Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Williams) that it is unfair on the independent scientists working in various Departments in Scotland, England and Wales—I refer not only to my Department but to independent agencies—to say that the experts are wrong. We have never experienced this sort of situation before. The hon. Member for Carlisle was right when he said that we faced the socialist incompetence of the Soviet Union. We had never had such a problem. We reacted quickly by issuing vigorous banning orders to ensure that the public was protected and, as we gained more experience, we reduced the number of areas involved and lightened the restrictions, when it was felt safe to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the issue of the regulations being introduced for a month only, may I tell the Committee that nearly all our restrictions are introduced for a month only. Our standard approach under the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 is to go for a monthly order. That has happened when there have been other incidents on farms. I am sorry if that period gave everyone the impression that the matter would be all over in a month. We always make it clear when we issue an order that we will renew it again and again if necessary, and will finalise it when it is safe to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martyn Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Minister that the incompetence shown by the state capitalists in the Soviet Union was also shown by the free market entrepreneurs of Three Mile Island. Nuclear energy, caesium and its radionuclides have been around for a long time. The reason why we cannot be certain about when the upland areas will be rid of contamination is possibly because it is not only Chernobyl that has contributed to that contamination. The levels found in the trout in the Trawsfynydd lake in 1978 were 1,000 bq/kg. I am not trying to create hysteria, but there is contamination in both Trawsfynydd and Sellafield. We are told that there is contamination from Chernobyl only, so we should be given an estimate of when restrictions can be lifted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is disingenous of the.hon. Gentleman to say that he is not trying to stir up a scare and then for him to hint obliquely that there are other forms of radiation in the area. We all know that the hon. Gentleman is trying to hint that Sellafield as well as Chernobyl is causing problems, but that is just not true. If that is what he is hinting at, I am sorry, but I shall have to slap him down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing a specific type of radiocaesium, which is clearly different from anything that may emerge from any other nuclear power station. We have a pile of monitoring data 6ft high and have published it all. If the hon. Gentleman has any doubts, he should start ploughing through the mass of information that has been published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to say a few words about Britain, our experts and the Government. The situation would have been the same if the Labour party were in power in 1986, as I do not believe that it would have acted differently. No other Government reacted as quickly, took as much action to protect their consumers and published as much information as the British Government. If the hon. Gentleman doubts that, he should go to the Library. Despite all that information, I cannot predict the date when in certain soil types no more radiocaesium will come up in the vegetation and be eaten by lambs. I cannot say that if certain chemicals were sprayed on the land—particularly peaty soils—could possibly speed up the end of the sage by locking some of the radiocaesium into the soil. That would have environmental and ecological disbenefits and I do not want to change the ecology of the Lake district by spraying it with chemicals that might do more harm than would be caused by leaving the radiocaesium in the soil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Carmarthen raised a good point about farmers bringing sheep down from the high fells. We encourage that. Farmers can move sheep down from the higher fells on to the lowland grass. The sheep are all marked—that is what mark and release is all about. Farmers cannot cheat the system. We encourage them to let the sheep feed on the lower grass where possible. In many parts of Scotland the system does not allow that, but in England it is possible. The sheep can live on the grass that is not contaminated, their radiocaesium level falls very low indeed, they are all live-monitored and 99.98 per cent. pass the monitoring test. They are then free to be marketed. The sheep are all marked—that is what mark and release is all about. Farmers cannot cheat the system. We encourage them to let the sheep feed on the lower grass where possible. In many parts of Scotland the system does not allow that, but in England it is possible. The sheep can live on the grass that is not contaminated, their radiocaesium level falls very low indeed, they are all live-monitored and 99.8 per cent. pass the monitoring test. They are then free to be marketed.

I assure the hon. Gentleman that that is not a con or some cheat. It is a sensible practice which helps to market more sheep and, at the same time, ensures that the public are protected. I commend the orders to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martlew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been accused by the Minister of scare-mongering. I am sorry to say that he has been badly briefed. His scientists said that there would be an increase in the incidence of thyroid cancers because of the Government's decision not to advise mothers to give infants the milk. That advice was issued in many other European countries, including Germany and Holland. The statistical evidence from the Minister's scientists shows that there will be extra cases of thyroid cancer as a result of that decision.

The Minister denied that it was highly probable that contaminated lamb entered the food chain. If he means that it is unlikely that people ate enough contaminated lamb for it to affect their health, I accept that. However, a Select Committee with a Conservative majority said that it was highly probable that contaminated lamb had entered the food chain.

The Government did not discover that a certain hot spot in north Yorkshire was contaminated and did not put restriction orders on it, until 18 months after the Chernobyl incident. That is an example of neglect and a dereliction of the Governments duty to protect the people. With reference to Cumbria, we should have been prepared for the incident. We had already experienced a minor Chernobyl. As the Minister whose constituency is in Cumbria, knows that was the Windscale fire in the mid-50s. Only when the Cabinet papers were made available 30 years later did we find out that had been much more serious than people had been told. There should have been a system in operation in Cumbria in case such an incident happened again, because of the nuclear plants there. The Government did not protect the public as they should have, by ensuring that an emergency did not occur.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had that in mind when I asked where the experts were at the time of Chernobyl. The 1957 Windscale incident dispersed large quantities of
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
radioactive material in an upland area and it should have been realised that moorland retains radioactive elements. That was one of the by-products of the Windscale experience, but it seems that we learnt nothing from that and in 1986 we started with a clean sheet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martlew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what my hon. Friend says. One of the problems in the early days at Windscale was that it was a military establishment and it was, therefore, covered by the cloak of military secrecy. That is a shame, because we could have learnt from it.

We welcome the orders. I notice that the only sheep that will survive to breed are the red-marked sheep, and I was glad to hear the Minister say that. I am sorry, however, that he has refused to look again at the compensation for farmers who are still affected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
