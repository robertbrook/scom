Draft Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on<br><br> Income) (Ghana) Order 1993</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen Dorrell)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income) (Ghana) Order 1993.</p></blockquote>
This debate is one of a series that have been held in recent months to examine new double taxation treaties. It is always a pleasure to see the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) arrive fully briefed on the intricacies not merely of the double taxation treaty but how it compares to the draft double taxation treaty of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which I see open before him.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman will remember from earlier debates the importance that the Government attach to the completion of double taxation treaties. We believe that they are an important part of the background against which an open international trading system can be encouraged between developed OECD countries and, in a slightly different way, between OECD countries and the countries of the developing world. The establishment of a proper double taxation regime liberates trade between the developed and developing world and facilitates the flow of investment capital into the developing world. Developing countries see that as an increasingly important part of the development process.<br><br>
Double taxation treaties have an important part to play in the development of an integrated world trading system. The treaty with Ghana is a good example of the importance that we attach to the treaties. The United Kingdom has important trading relationships with Ghana: 30 per cent, of all OECD imports into Ghana come from the United Kingdom, and British companies currently have £300 million worth of investments in the Ghanaian economy. The treaty is therefore important to many significant British companies and to the bilateral economic relationships between this country and Ghana.<br><br>
The treaty replaces an arrangement reached in 1947 between Britain and the Gold Coast, as Ghana then was. It also replaces a convention that was agreed and signed by Britain and Ghana in 1977 but, for a variety of reasons, not ratified by the Ghanaian Government. Further negotiations in July 1991 led to the initialling of the treaty in January 1993.<br><br>
I commend the treaty. It forms an important part of the bilateral economic infrastructure between the United Kingdom and Ghana. I shall deal with specific and important points about where the treaty departs from the OECD model if the Committee wishes, perhaps in response to the questions with which I know the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East to be pregnant.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
<p>10.33 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I begin by welcoming you, Mr Hill, to the Chair? I believe that this is the first time that you have presided over a Standing Committee on statutory instruments dealing with double taxation treaties. I hope that you enjoy our proceedings as much as we shall. Under your enlightened guidance I am sure that we shall make swift and workmanlike progress.<br><br>
I welcome the Minister's general opening remarks. He put the treaty in its proper context. I do not dissent from the general force of his remarks. Like Conservative Members, I spent the Whitsun recess reading the OECD model double taxation treaty, comparing it to the Ghanaian treaty before us. Conservative Members shake their heads, suggesting that they did not spend the recess reading the OECD model double taxation treaty. The model treaty is now in handy loose-leaf form, so that as thinking on these matters advances it will be possible to replace the 1963 version with a later version. I note that hon. Members did not spend their recess thinking about Ghana; perhaps their minds were on Uganda, which we shall debate later.<br><br>
The treaty differs in some important respects from the model OECD treaty. I suppose that the Minister is wondering how many of them I have spotted before he covers that ground himself. Under article 3(1)(e) of the Ghanaian draft, the term "person" excludes partnerships. There may be an understandable reason for that; I am not sure whether there is a partnership structure in the Ghanaian economy that is comparable with the intention of the double taxation treaty under the OECD draft. Will the Financial Secretary explain why partnerships are excluded?<br><br>
The Ghanaian draft quotes a six month limit under article 5(2)(g), whereas the OECD model proposes a 12 month limit. I do not know whether Conservative Members had the OECD model in front of them when they were mugging up for the Committee or whether they know it by heart, but the terms under article 5(2)(h) and (i) are unique to the Ghanaian treaty. As they are not in the OECD treaty, will the Financial Secretary tell me why such references are made in the Ghanaian treaty, given that we are being asked to approve it?<br><br>
Article 7(3) of the Ghanaian draft contains provisions that are substantially amplified. I should be obliged if the Minister will explain why that differs from the OECD model treaty. Under article 8, Ghana has excluded the paragraph that deals with inland waterways transport. That might be because the industry is in public ownership or because of another reason. Although it may relate specifically to the Ghanaian economy, I see no reason why the OECD recommendation on inland waterways transport was excluded from the treaty, Furthermore, the text of article 8 does not follow the OECD model. Will the Financial Secretary tell us why such a deviation was made?<br><br>
Article 10(2)(a) of the Ghanaian treaty refers to a figure of 7½per cent., whereas the OECD model quotes a rate of 5 per cent. I accept that under bilateral treaties it is open to the two nations to set different percentages, but I wonder why the rates differ. Paragraphs (6) and (7) of article 10 are unique to the Ghanaian treaty; they do not exist under the OECD model. Will the Minister explain why the new paragraphs were incorporated in the treaty?<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0740">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
The OECD model quoted an interest rate of 10 per cent., whereas article 11(2) of the Ghanaian treaty quotes a rate of 12½ per cent. That increase of 2½ per cent, is similar to the increase under article 10(2)(a). Under article 11(3), Ghana does not exclude penalty charges for late payment from the definition of the term "interest", but does exclude any item
<br><blockquote><p>"which is treated as a distribution under Article 10".</p></blockquote>
Why was such a special formulation deemed to be necessary? Will the Minister say whether it was our Government who wished such a provision to be inserted or whether it was inserted at the request of the Government of Ghana?<br><br>
On the assumption that I have the latest OECD model, I note that paragraphs (7) to (12) of article 11 of the Ghanaian treaty are not in the OECD draft. I apologise if I do not have the latest draft, but such provisions are important as they deal with the taxation of interest, which is vital to trading partners. I am sure that the Minister will tell me that there are other differences that I did not spot. I look forward to his response. It is not our intention to challenge the general construction of the treaty, but merely to probe points of detail.</span></p>
<p>10.40 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Marlow <span class='memberconstituency'>(Northampton, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to give my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary an opportunity to prepare for his SATs—standard assessment tasks—on double taxation, and I know how keen you, Mr. Hill, are that these matters should be properly debated.<br><br>
I note that one of the taxes covered by the document is corporation tax. As a member of the the Government, my hon. Friend is gung-ho about moving towards European union. We manage to attract into the United Kingdom an above-average share of foreign investment because of our levels of taxation, especially our level of corporation tax, which is most encouraging for those who want to invest in this country.<br><br>
Those who favour European union aim to harmonise taxes such as corporation tax. That would, I believe, be greatly to the detriment of the United Kingdom, but the Government know better and are pursuing their objective of European Union. If they achieve that, as night follows day, we shall have common rates of corporation tax. When that happens, what will be the relevance of the double taxation relief document to Ghana? Will it still apply, or will the Committee have to consider a new document? Because the Government are so enthusiastic about the enterprise of European union, it will happen very soon. Why are we discussing the document now, when within weeks, if the Government have their way, we could be discussing a new document? If I may take the point a little further—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not too far.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Marlow</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Knowing how keen you, Mr. Hill, are that the matter should be properly debated, I shall raise just one further point. Given that trade policy as a whole is now decided by the European Community, is it not logical that matters of double taxation, which are very much to do with trade, should be dealt with entirely by the European Community? The House is, after all, merely an outpost of the Brussels Commission, so surely it is logical that we should allow the Commission to decide all such matters on
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
our behalf. Members of the Commission are grown-up people who know how to do such things much better than we do.</span></p>
<p>10.42 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was in error in not welcoming you, Mr. Hill, to the Chair. To make amends for that, I associate myself warmly with the remarks made by the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East.<br><br>
With no disrespect to the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East, I shall deal first with the questions asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Mr. Marlow). On trade policy, the arrangements in the European Community are, and have been since the day that we joined it, that our external trade policy—our policy on tariffs, quotas and trading arrangements between the Community and other countries—is a matter of Community competence. The double taxation treaty deals with the taxation of profits, dividends, royalty and interest flows and so on, which are explicitly outside Community competence on trade policy. There is a clear distinction between Community competence on trade policy and the matters covered by the treaty.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North is onto a slightly stronger point when he asks what would be the implications of a Community regime on corporation tax for this country's double taxation arrangements with third countries. My hon. Friend can be reassured that the Maastricht treaty creates no new obligations, understandings or even mood music with regard to corporation tax. The matter was examined recently in the context of the Ruding report, which indeed proposed Community action on corporation tax, but the Council of Ministers accepted a draft conclusion tabled by the British Government last December which explicitly ensures that responsibility for corporation tax—for the tax base and for rates of corporation tax—remains with the national Governments of member states.<br><br>
My hon. Friend for Northampton, North would be right to conclude that if there were a Community corporation tax regime, it would have implications for our bilateral double taxation agreements with third countries. I assure him that there is no intention of creating such a regime. The Community considered that proposal in the second half of last year and turned away from it.<br><br>
The hon. Member of Newcastle upon Tyne, East asked why the definition of "person" excludes partnership. I am told that Ghana does not regard partnerships as legal entities. Exclusion has the effect of limiting treaty benefits to members of the partnership resident in the treaty country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We regard partnerships as legal entities. How will British partnerships be affected by the treaty?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The treaty affects legal persons. It is important that the arrangements negotiated between the two countries are balanced in the way that they impact on people resident in both countries. If Ghana does not regard a partnership as a legal entity, it is no good signing a double taxation treaty containing an obligation on the two contracting parties to recognise partnerships. The partnership concept is unknown in Ghanaian law and there is therefore no reason to include a definition of it in a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0741">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
bilateral treaty. Nothing in the treaty would significantly limit the application of the treaty's benefits to UK partnerships.<br><br>
I am advised that the UK does not regard partnerships as legal entities for tax purposes. The individual partners are taxed on their share of profits in the UK. Members of a UK partnership are entitled, as individuals, to benefit from the terms of the treaty. They are not entitled to benefit as a partnership because the partnership is unknown as a taxable entity in English law.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East asked why the date on which a building site becomes a permanent establishment has been reduced from 12 months in the OECD text to six months in the Ghanaian text. The UK wished to secure that provision because in Ghana there is a strong representation of British companies in construction. They sought that provision and we believe that it will facilitate a bilateral trading arrangement between the two countries.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked why article 7(3) departs from the OECD model. Paragraph (3) denies a deduction when computing the profits of a permanent establishment for interest, royalties, fees or similar payments where they were made by the establishment to the head office in the UK. Ghana sought that provision. It is concerned to ensure that in computing the taxable profit of a permanent establishment that is a branch of a British company based in Ghana, management charges cannot be deducted to the UK parent company. It does not effect a management charge in a subsidiary company, but does effect a permanent branch of a British company resident in Ghana.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman is right that article 10 represents a departure from the OECD norm. The rate of withholding tax on dividend payments is always the subject of negotiation under a double taxation treaty arrangement. The arrangements that we have arrived at, whereby a portfolio investment will have withholding tax imposed at up to 15 per cent, and a trade investment withholding tax of up to 7½per cent.—half the portfolio rate—represent a reasonable deal in the world of the 1990s. The Ghanaians originally sought a higher rate of withholding tax on trade investments, but we secured their agreement to a rate that is half the portfolio rate—a good deal for British companies.<br><br>
Article 10(6) is needed because, without it, a charitable trust, which is exempt from tax, would be denied the benefit of the article. Article 7 is an anti-abuse provision. The OECD model leaves such provision to be dealt with bilaterally.<br><br>
On the question of article 11 and the treatment of interest payments from an activity resident in one country to a host resident in the other country, the interest level of 12½ per cent, once again represents a reasonable deal in the context of a developing country. The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East may be interested to know that, for example, in the conventions signed in 1947 and 1977 the equivalent figure was 15 per cent, and the double taxation agreement with Nigeria currently provides for a maximum withholding rate on interest and royalty payments of 15 per cent. So, although the figure is still above the OECD norm, it represents progress towards the low taxation of interest and royalty payments. I am pleased to welcome the hon. Gentleman to the ranks of those who are concerned to ensure that marginal rates of tax on such payments are kept as low a possible. I trust that that interest in low marginal
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
rates of tax will be extended beyond the slightly arcane subject of withholding tax payments on interest and royalties into the more general sphere of economic activity.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked me about the later paragraphs of article 11. I am told that they are anti-abuse provisions, which the OECD model once again leaves to be tailored in the bilateral negotiations between member states.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked why article 8 excludes inland waterways. I am advised that inland waterway transport is not international traffic under the UK-Ghana treaty, although it can be under the OECD model for neighbour states where there is inland waterway transport between them. So far as I know, there are no inland waterways joining the United Kingdom and Ghana.<br><br>
I think that the only question that the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East asked to which I have not responded concerned sub-paragraphs (h) and (i). If I may, I shall write to him about the position under article 5. I hope that I have responded fairly to the hon. Gentleman's questions and I commend the treaty to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>10.53 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure; questions remain unanswered. The Financial Secretary did not tell the Committee whether there are other areas in which the Ghanaian treaty does not meet the OECD model or has peculiar features which the diligent Opposition failed to spot in its thoroughgoing researches. What else is there that we should be told but have not been? We are left to wonder.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Northampton, North mentioned corporation tax. Given his interest in corporation tax, I was slightly surprised that the Financial Secretary did not invite him to Thursday's sitting of the Finance Bill Committee, when we shall discuss that matter more extensively. On behalf of the Opposition, I extend such an invitation to the hon. Member for Northampton, North. I know that the hon. Gentleman is interested in the matter.<br><br>
We have considered the Order and the Opposition have no objection to it in principle. However, questions remain unanswered and we are reluctant to report to the House that the matter has been fully scrutinised.</span></p>
<p>10.55 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Marlow</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to respond to the hon. Gentlemen's invitation but, unfortunately, I do not have a long enough spoon.<br><br>
On the subject of corporation tax, I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary for telling the Committee, in the time-honoured words, that the Government have no plans at this stage. However, he will be aware that, under stage 2, the Commission writes reports on the economies of the various member states. Is my hon. Friend saying that, in its report, the Commission will not be entitled, under any circumstances, to comment on the relative levels of corporation tax in Community countries?</span></p>
<p>10.56 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot say on what matters the Commission may comment, but it certainly has no power to impose any obligations on us under stage 2. It seems profoundly improbable that it will elaborate in detail, even within the terms of multilateral surveillance, on the benefits
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0742">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
of one tax against another. The concern in multilateral surveillance is to examine the broad thrust of fiscal policy in the different member states.<br><br>
There are two views on whether that is a desirable activity but one cannot argue with two propositions. The first is that that is unlikely to spill over into a detailed analysis of tax policy in relation to a particular tax, especially against the background of the Council of Ministers' rejection of the much more detailed proposals of the Ruding report last December.<br><br>
The second proposition, which is clearly unarguable, is that at stage 2 as set out in the Maastricht treaty, whatever the opinions of the Commission and the Council of Ministers on British fiscal policy, it remains the responsibility of the British Government.</span></p>

<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered that the draft Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income) (Uganda) Order 1993.</p></blockquote>
I shall not detain the Committee with a detailed exposition of why the Government regard double taxation treaties as important. The same principles apply to this order as did to the Ghanaian order.<br><br>
The history of bilateral tax and financial arrangements between the United Kingdom and Uganda is, unfortunately, pockmarked with the sad record of that country in the past few years, but I shall go through it to explain how we arrived at the present position.<br><br>
There has been an arrangement between the United Kingdom and Uganda since 1952. The Ugandans believed that, under their law, that arrangement came to an end with independence in 1962, since when there has been no formal agreement between the two countries. In 1985, it was agreed at a bilateral meeting that it was important that a double taxation treaty should be negotiated between the two countries and the terms of such a treaty were agreed. However, the domestic circumstances of Uganda between 1985 and last year were such that the Ugandans were unable to complete the process.<br><br>
Last year, we secured their agreement to the text of a new treaty, which was signed in December. I hope that the Committee will accept that treaty as the basis of a new
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
chapter in the economic relationships between Britain and Uganda and that the story of the next few years will be rather happier than that of the past. At the moment, our trading relationships are relatively few but we believe that, with more stable domestic circumstances in Uganda, there is opportunity for those trading arrangements to grow. Uganda has major opportunities in the tea, coffeee and cotton industries and significant British companies represented in the country are interested in securing—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Marlow</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Lonrho.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not, in this case, including Lonrho, which is represented far more significantly in Ghana than it is in Uganda. I think of Mowlam, the construction company, BAT, Mitchell Cotts and Shell as significant British companies represented in Uganda. I hope and believe that they will welcome the treaty as facilitating both trade and investment flows between the two countries.<br><br>
I commend the treaty to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>11.2 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Financial Secretary for his opening remarks. I fully share his general views and it is not the intention of the Opposition to delay the passage of this treaty unreasonably. As the hon. Gentleman said, it marks an important step in the development of our relations with Uganda. However, perhaps for the reasons that he set out, it departs quite considerably, or, as the Prime Minister would say, not inconsiderably, from the OECD model. Therefore, it is right that we should ask him to explain the details of some points before we report to the House that we have fully considered these matters and are satisfied with aspects that might otherwise be thought a little unusual.<br><br>
I shall list several points and perhaps the Financial Secretary will respond to them in the same cheerful way as he did when we discussed the previous matters. Article 4(1) defines the term "resident" without exclusions although a list of exclusions is quoted in the 1963 draft convention. To leave the term less thoroughly denned may lead to arguments about interpretation. I am sure that there is a reason for specifically excluding the definitions and I hope that the Financial Secretary will tell us what it is.<br><br>
Sub-paragraphs (f), (g) and (i) of article 5(1) are additional definitions not found in the OECD model. I am sure that they are included at either our request or that of the Uganda Government and they relate specifically to the trading positions between our two countries. It would help if the Financial Secretary explained exactly what special circumstances they are designed to address.<br><br>
Article 5(3) of the draft order allows permanent establishment after 183 days. As we learned when debating the Ghanaian treaty, the OECD model allows it after 12 months. How was the figure of 183 arrived at? It sounds as if some negotiation and bargaining took place. Perhaps the Financial Secretary will tell us about the background to that decision. It is not quite as clinically explicable as was the six months allowed under the Ghanaian treaty.<br><br>
Article 7(2) is not subject to the provisions of paragraph (3). That does not accord with the 1963 draft convention. Will the Financial Secretary tell us why?<br><br>
Under article 8, we again return to the point about inland waterways. The OECD model includes inland waterways in the title but the draft order does not. The order also omits
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0743">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
paragraph (2) of the OECD model, which refers to inland waterways. The explanation may be the same as for the Ghanaian treaty. If so, the Financial Secretary should tell the Committee.<br><br>
Article 9(2) of the 1963 convention is omitted from the draft order. Why did the two Governments decide to drop it.<br><br>
Sub-paragraph (a) of the OECD model is omitted from article 10(2). I understand that article 10 would impose a rate of 15 per cent, in all cases. By not including subparagraph (a) of the OECD model, we are not allowing a 5 per cent, category. Perhaps the Financial Secretary will tell us why.<br><br>
Article 11(1) of the OECD model sets an interest rate of 10 per cent.; the draft order sets a rate of 15 per cent. I am sure that the explanation will be the same as for the Ghanaian treaty—that it is a matter for bilateral negotiation between the Governments. Perhaps the Financial Secretary will tell us whether the 15 per cent, rate was arrived at after hard bargaining and whether it represents a good deal for Britain, for Uganda or for both countries.<br><br>
Article 11(4) of the draft order does not exclude penalty charges for late payment, but does exclude
<br><blockquote><p>"any item which is treated as a distribution under the provisions of Article 10".</p></blockquote>
Will the Financial Secretary tell us how that formulation was arrived at?<br><br>
Article 11(3) is unique to the Ugandan treaty; it is not contained in the OECD model. Why were the special conditions necessary?<br><br>
Article 12(1) of the OECD model is expanded in the Ugandan draft into paragraphs (1) and (2). A limit on royalties of 15 per cent, is introduced, which is unique to the Ugandan order. Why is that?<br><br>
Article 12(5) of the draft order is not to be found in the OECD model. The same is true of article 13, which deals with technical fees. Why was it necessary to have a special section dealing with technical fees in our treaty with Uganda when the OECD model dealt sufficiently well with such matters.<br><br>
Article 14(3) deals with capital gains. The draft order omits boats engaged in inland waterways transport—perhaps because of the unique features of the Ugandan economy—but it differs from the model. I assume that it is felt that the model generally covers such circumstances adequately.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
Article 15(1) deals with independent personal services. The draft order inserts the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to the provisions of Article 13"</p></blockquote>
and sub-paragraph (b) is not in the OECD model. Will the Financial Secretary tell us why it is necessary to have a special section to deal with independent personal services?<br><br>
Article 18(3) is not in the OECD draft. It deals with the treatment of artistes and athletes and is peculiar to the draft order. Article 19 deals with pensions. The OECD model does not mention annuities, and thus paragraph (2) is not included in the model. Is there something special about the treatment of annuities in Uganda that requires a special construction?<br><br>
Article 21 concerns "Income not expressly mentioned". The OECD model does not mention trusts; the treaty does. Paragraph (2) excludes certain types of income. That could be quite a significant exception; it is certainly unusual. Will the Financial Secretary tell us why it is necessary? We are worried about tax avoidance—I hope that it does not open an avenue for that. It is not clear to me what is intended by that paragraph.<br><br>
Article 22 of the OECD model, which deals in a routine way with the taxation of capital, is entirely omitted from the draft order. Why is that? Article 23, which sets out the purpose of the treaty—the elimination of double taxation, also does not follow the OECD model. I suppose that there must be a reason for that special construction and those particular words. I assume that it is because of the preceding articles.<br><br>
Paragraph (2) of the OECD model is omitted from article 24. Will the Financial Secretary tell me why that is? Article 24(6) of the OECD model applies to taxes of every kind and description. The construction of the treaty does not follow that—the phrase <br><blockquote><p>"of every kind and description"</p></blockquote>
is not there. Article 25(1) of the OECD model contains a three-year time limit for presenting a case. Again, that is not included here. Article 27(2) of the OECD model is not included. Why is that? Article 28 of the OECD model, which deals with territorial extension, is not included in the draft order. I wonder why that is.<br><br>
Those are a range of detailed technical questions, which I know have held the Committee spellbound. I expect that the Financial Secretary will now criticise me for not having spotted something that I should have spotted in article 21. It may help him if I repeat my earlier remark that we are not opposed in principle to the treaty. I should be happy if the Financial Secretary were to say that he will write comprehensively to me on these points rather than answer them now, as long as that was satisfactory to you, Mr. Hill and to other Conservative members of the Committee. I know however, that you, Mr. Hill, will think that that is not right and that Conservative Members will want to hear the answers. If they do, I also want to hear them. On the other hand, I should be happy to deal with these matters of detail—they do not affect the main thrust of the treaty—by letter rather than by debate, if that is the Committee's wish.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I stand ready to respond in detail to the hon.

I shall gladly send it to the hon. Gentleman and circulate it to my hon. Friends who, I am sure—to use my hon. Friend's phrase—will be "spellbound" by the contents of the letter.</span></p>
