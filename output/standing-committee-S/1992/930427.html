Income-related Benefits Schemes (Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 1993</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Income-related Benefits Schemes (Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 1993 (S.I., 1993, No. 315).—<i>[Mr. Burt.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Keith Bradley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Manchester, Withington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall listen carefully to the Minister's remarks, which will come later, on the totality of the regulations. However, I want to make some short preliminary remarks on the jobplan workshop and restart schemes and on the reduction from two years to 12 months as the period before which penalties may be imposed on claimants if they fail to attend.<br><br>
While we recognise that any action that tries to overcome the appalling problem of unemployment figures of three million, and that training mechanisms that try to help people get back into work must be welcome, we must question whether the existing schemes are of great value when we consider the drop-out rate and the penalties that are already imposed on people. Between April 1991 and March 1992, 3,804 people had their income support reduced for non-attendance or early leaving. That worked out at about 317 claimants per month. Between April 1992 and December 1992, a further 3,098 people had their income support reduced, which was about 344 claimants per month. If those schemes have such merit and are so valuable in helping people get back into work, why do so many people drop out and have to have a penalty imposed on them? We must question whether such a financial penalty is the best way to encourage people back into the workplace.<br><br>
The Minister may say that the penalty is a reduction in only one week's benefit because the schemes last for only one week, but any reduction in income support can have a major impact on a person's ability to meet his or her expenditure that week. If the schemes are part-time, for half a day a week for example, they could extend to 14 weeks and the claimant's income support could be reduced each week. For people on the edge of poverty, such a weekly reduction in income support could be extremely damaging. Therefore, although we recognise the value of helping people back into work, we question whether financial penalties are the correct way to proceed.<br><br>
Related to that, although the amount of the penalty may be reduced, we must question whether a financial penalty is the right way to proceed in cases involving serious illness or pregnancy. I realise that the reduction is from 40 to 20 per cent. in those circumstances, but is it right to reduce the income support of claimants in such cases? We have to consider sensitively the nature of illnesses in the family to ensure that people are not being penalised unfairly.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
Related to that is the penalty imposed if a person undertaking voluntary work decides not to go on to a restart scheme. In my experience, voluntary work is a good step for many people trying to find permanent employment. Voluntary work has much value and it may be a better and more valuable experience than the Government's one-week workshop plan. It would be detrimental to those people's interests if they were penalised because they have been forced to give up voluntary work in order to go on to a restart scheme. I hope that the Minister will tell us why those doing valid and valuable voluntary work may be penalised if they refuse to go on to a restart scheme. They may consider themselves to be in a better position to get back into full-time work by undertaking voluntary work than they would be if they went on one of the Government's schemes.<br><br>
The other related element is the appeals mechanism. If one can lose much of one's income support for failing to attend or for leaving a course, it is crucial to have the right of appeal. The scheme operates in such a way that one cannot make an appeal until the case has been assessed by a senior officer at the DSS. That can lead to tremendous delay. If one is on a week-by-week income, any delay may have detrimental effects on it. There should be a better mechanism to ensure that people do not lose their income support before they have the right of appeal.<br><br>
One has to question whether the regulations are the best way to try to put people back into work. Any attempt by the Government to mitigate the damage that they have caused to the economy by forcing so many millions on to the dole is to be welcomed. But to have a double whammy—forcing people into unemployment and then financially penalising them if they do not see the Government's restart scheme to be of particular benefit—is not the way to proceed.<br><br>
It is startling that, in their propaganda, the Government use a balloon flying away to promote the jobplan scheme. The slogan
<br><blockquote><p>"Give your jobhunting a lift"</p></blockquote>
and the image of a balloon flying away are the Government's hot air at its best. They will come down to earth with a bump when they find that the restart scheme and the jobplan workshops do not move people into decent employment. The propaganda claims that the scheme offers people "choices" back into employment, but if people face a financial penalty because they refuse to go on the scheme, one questions whether they have a real choice or whether they are being dragooned on to it. The only choice is to be financially penalised if one does not attend the scheme. Does the propoganda relate to the real world in which we operate? From our advice surgeries, we shall learn whether the unemployed regard the scheme as the liftoff that they were hoping for.<br><br>
I shall listen with interest to the Minister's response to my points and to his wider comments on the regulations. We shall then be able to decide whether we need to pursue the matter further.<br><br>
10.39 am</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Anthony Steen <span class='memberconstituency'>(South Hams)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we have the pleasure of hearing the Minister, I thought that the Committee might like the pleasure of hearing me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood <span class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0164">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have some general comments to make that are appropriate not only to this, but to all Standing Committees.<br><br>
I am inspired by the remarks of Lord Howe of Aberavon in a recent address to the Statute Law Society when he said that we are overloading the legislative process by the passage of too much law. The CBI has said that the quantity of legislation could adversely affect its quality. The TUC has complained about too many and too frequent changes in the law. We now have a statutory instrument that will add to the growing number of statutory instruments. More and more people have to be employed to deal with them and more and more officials are needed to interpret the rules and regulations.<br><br>
I wish briefly to deal with the problem that is facing this and Committees throughout the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I trust that the hon. Gentleman will now refer to the instrument before the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely, Mr. O'Hara, because this is my preamble to the regulations.<br><br>
In 1901, there were 156 statutory instruments. In 1981, there were 1,892 and, in 1991, there were 2,945.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must rule that the hon. Gentleman is not discussing the instrument before the Committee, but is raising matters of procedure. This is not the appropriate occasion for so doing. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to make specific comments on the matter before us, I am sure that the Committee will be happy to listen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand, Mr. O'Hara. I am trying to explain to the Committee that there are already 2,945 statutory instruments on the statute book; we do not need 2,946. I wonder whether this statutory instrument is another example of the growing number of such instruments that are filling up the Committees along this Corridor? They burden the Government with more and more rules and regulations, and the House cannot manage. Therefore, will my hon. Friend the Minister consider whether this statutory instrument is required? Must we have more and more rules and regulations? Indeed, must we sit here at all?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Alastair Burt)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate and understand the background to my hon. Friend's remarks. It might assist him to know that the regulations under discussion amend existing regulations. There is nothing new. It is a standard package to change a variety of regulations and to make necessary technical adjustments. I assure my hon. Friend that the regulations involve nothing new. They are designed to make existing law work better. I hope that that information assists my hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Whenever my hon. Friend the Minister speaks, his views are always a great help to me, to the Committee and to the House. I am glad to say that that occasion was no exception.<br><br>
However, what my hon. Friend has just said explains the problem. The statutory instrument amends existing statutory instruments to make them clearer. That involves a fine quality of statutory instrument. We no longer have a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
straightforward statutory instrument; we must have one that amends existing statutory instruments so that everyone can understand how they work.<br><br>
I do not wish to burden the Committee. We all have many other things to do—we probably have to attend more Committees considering statutory instruments. However, there is a real problem. I simply wish to put down a marker—no doubt you realise this, too, Mr. O'Hara—that the process is more like a Kafka nightmare. We all have to stand up and to speak. I say this with no disrespect to the Minister's officials, but if the number of departmental officials were cut by 90 per cent. such statutory instruments could not be produced and then we should not have to sit at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did the hon. Member for South Hams (Mr. Steen) a disservice and injustice by suggesting that the Committee did not want to hear what he had to say. I am very sympathetic to his view and have made the same point on several occasions.<br><br>
It would be almost impossible for any member of the Committee to study this set of amendments to regulations—I understand that they do not add to the total number—because all the material referred to in them is not to hand. Hon. Members would need to obtain photocopies of the statutory instruments, some going back to 1990, and so on. That makes matters difficult. Some of the changes in income support and family credit have been beneficial, but it is difficult for hon. Members to keep track of changes. It is also fiendishly difficult for people who give advice to claimants to stay abreast of such changes.<br><br>
The blue books are good at bringing together and keeping up to date amending legislation, but it is now taking weeks, if not months, for amendments to come from the Department through HMSO. It is difficult to stay on top of all the changes to the benefit system through statutory instrument amendments. I am glad that the hon. Member for South Hams made that point, although I agree that to pursue it at length would lead us out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not that the problem? We can never pursue that matter because it will always lead us out of order. I have been trying for months to find the right place in which to discuss it but I do not know where it is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman cannot find the right place I am unlikely to be able to help him. However, if he finds it and lets me know about it, I shall join in the discussion.<br><br>
These are important and far-reaching technical changes. I am pleased that we have a chance to listen to the Minister and to ask him questions. For the first time, the regulations provide a definition of water charges. I have been worried about the impact of water charges on the benefit system for some time. Changes were made when the community charge was introduced and those changes are now bringing into play council tax benefit.<br><br>
I want to raise a more fundamental point about the resources that can be provided for claimants, or, as they are now affectionately known, customers of the agency. Water charges are unpredictable in different parts of the country. Water and sewerage charges in certain areas are very high; they are higher in the west country than in my part of southeast Scotland, but there is no way properly to take account of them.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0165">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
I understand that the general RPI uplift in the annual uprating increases benefit rates, at least in theory, to take account of all increases, including water and sewerage charges. I am told that the position is worse in the west country, but my experience is that water charges are spiralling ahead of RPI increases and that they are likely to continue to increase for some time.<br><br>
It has always been difficult to discuss such matters because water charges were never defined. The regulations define them for the first time, so I want to use this occasion to welcome that importation of a definition of water charges into the benefit system and to ask the Minister to consider carefully whether there is a better way to accommodate the increases. As constituency Members of Parliament who regularly attend surgeries, we know that people will complain to us for years to come that their benefits, and the increases to them, do not take account of the actual increases in water and sewerage charges.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty <span class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman suggest how the Government can take into account the fact that water charges in Scotland, under local authority care, are much lower and appear as though they will not increase as much? The average charge in my region is £47, whereas I believe that it is about a couple of hundred pounds in the south-west.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a helpful reminder that water is still under local authority care in Scotland, although I am not sure for how much longer. If I began to speak about the rights and wrongs of privatisation I should not, under your chairmanship, Mr. O'Hara, get far. However, it is true that local authorities in Scotland have been able to administer water and sewerage charges to the benefit not only of social security claimants who must pay those charges but of the general population. Long may that continue. Neither are there disconnections, as there are under the privatised water system south of the border. It is right to draw the Committee's attention to the point. Will the Minister give the Committee an undertaking that he will carefully examine the changes to see whether there is any scope for putting extra assistance into the pockets of claimants or customers, now that water charges have been defined in the regulations?<br><br>
Secondly, with regard to regulation 4,I am, having been a humble Scottish provincial solicitor in a previous incarnation, fascinated by the Department's approach to the definition of persons from abroad.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Baker (Lords Commissioner to the Treasury)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Never humble.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am being attacked.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Baker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, defended.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Defended! That is even worse. The definition of persons from abroad is an important one and it is difficult for the Department to get the concept right in relation to the regulations. I should be obliged if the Minister would say something about how the Department will deal with the questions, which are now before the courts, about the definitions of persons from abroad.<br><br>
I understand from my background reading that the definition is derived from the immigration rules. However, we should be considering not people who are covered by the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
immigration Acts, but people who are covered by EC legislation, because there is a distinction between the two. I understand that sophisticated legal arguments are going on in various forums and courts, but could the Minister explain why regulation 4 is proposed and whether it distinguishes between people who are classified as persons from abroad under the immigration Acts and those covered by EC legislation?<br><br>
Thirdly, the points that were made by the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Bradley) at the beginning of the sitting, about the restart scheme and the regulations as they apply to it, were right. I cannot imagine what the benefit will be of reducing the provisions from two years to one year or of the changes in that direction that the regulations make. I should like some justification of the Department's belief, that it is necessary. What evidence does it have to back up the changes? What effects does it think they will bring? I have some fears about regulation 5.<br><br>
Finally, could the Minister say a word about the changes that are being made to the family credit and disability working allowance regulations in relation to the provision that
<br><blockquote><p>"where a child or young person has capital in excess of £3,000 any income of that child or young person consisting of maintenance is to be treated as the income of the claimant"?</p></blockquote>
Why is that considered to be necessary? Has such a problem been encountered in many cases? Is the regulation necessary? Will not it be unfair suddenly to take into account capital that is in the possession of a dependant of a claimant? I ask this because, to use the thin end of the wedge argument, I should not like to think that that was the beginning of a move by the Department to examine more closely the capital, or income, of claimant's dependants, in assessing eligibility for benefit. I hope that the Minister will be able to say a little about the provenance of that change, how it is justified, and whether the Department has any plans to extend the provision so as to bring the resources available to dependants into the assessment of claimant's eligibility for benefits in future.</span></p>
<p>10.55 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fully support the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Withington. Forms of punishing people to try to force them to go on to a Government scheme, whether it be restart or any other, have been a failure over the past decade. The Government appear to have learnt their lesson and still regard people who are not in employment as having to be whipped in. The Government have a scrounger mentality about the unemployed. I caution them that their reputation will continue to be damaged by forcing people, to go on to schemes that they do not think are relevant through penalties in benefits. It may be better if the Government looked to the Department of Employment to make such schemes relevant. People have again and again gone on to schemes. The same people have also gone on to enforced schemes. At the end of them, they have not gained employment. The quality of such schemes as well as the quality and purpose of interviews are at fault.<br><br>
I reiterate my support for allowing people to do worthwhile voluntary work. Some are told that they must cease doing such work. I know many people who have refused to take benefit rather than give up their voluntary work. I thought that we had had promises from the Government that they would seriously examine ways to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0166">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
allow people to continue to do such work, as was stated in the Budget. However, people will have to break from it and go for interviews that they think have no relevance and will probably not lead to employment. They will not be able to do voluntary work. We thought that the Government had seen sense and would encourage voluntary work.<br><br>
Secondly, I have a simple question. Benefits that are relevant to the council tax are sensitive. Will the Minister give an assurance that they will be so sensitive that they will be back-dated to the day that a person moves? There is still a large council housing sector in Scotland and people move from house to house in the hope of securing a better environment for their children. I want a simple assurance that benefits will be back-dated to the date that people move from one home to another, should the council tax be more in the home to which they move.<br><br>
Thirdly, I want to discuss the definition of water charges. The Minister should give time to giving us an assurance that there will be sensitivity and adequacy, something that should range across the benefits system, in the uprating for water charges. I should like an assurance on behalf of the people of Scotland that there will be one uprating rather than a different uprating for Scotland, where frugality and good management have kept water charges down. Profligacy and profit-mongering have put charges through the roof in most parts of England and Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Baker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not true.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I pay £119 for a single bedroom flat in a tenament in Southwark. I pay £62 in Scotland for a four-bedroom villa under a local authority-run water and sewerage scheme. That tells us that one is efficient and the other is about profit. I can drink the water in central Scotland. I cannot drink the water in London, but pay twice as much for it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the south-west, where there is more coastline than anywhere else and there is the worst problem of sewage in the sea, South West Water is committed to a programme, which is in my view too rapid, that has resulted in the clean-up of the coast and forcing water charges—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I had hoped that the hon. Gentleman was going to make remarks relevant to the business that is before us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because of the decision of the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues who voted for privatisation, they are being penalised by charges to pay for the clean-up of beaches. If there were a national system, I would be supporting him. That leads to my point that a universal uprate in benefit would have covered everyone. The privatised companies are putting charges up in what appears to be a disproportionate manner in England and Wales compared to Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has come skilfully back on course.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, by a slight aside. I would like the Minister to give me an assurance about uprating. I should also like to hear his explanation—I am sure that people outside will note it—to Conservative voters in the south of England and elsewhere of why there should be a universal uprating, which would obviously give a slight advantage to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
Scottish people, but not be adequate for the charges faced by people in parts of England. I am sure that Conservative voters want to hear the answer.</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the spirit in which the regulations have been debated and to all hon. Members who have contributed.<br><br>
I shall deal first with the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for South Hams and give some of the background to the regulations. The regulations are amendments, mostly technical, to existing regulations. My hon. Friend made a fair point because the need for the changes in the regulations is to clarify existing law and to ensure that there is no misinterpretation. It is true that the more regulation that there is, the more is the likelihood of misinterpretation. But, as all good lawyers know, we legislate with the aim of improving a particular circumstance. When, for one reason or another, what we are dealing with becomes less clear, it is necessary to make an amendment to improve the position. That is life.<br><br>
My hon. Friend warned us that we should be extremely careful about the amount of legislation that we pass and that Ministers should ask their officials whether it is really needed. That is a straightforward and important point, which I hope all hon. Members will take very much to heart. However, with the best will in the world, there are circumstances in which we must tidy up legislation and we must make regulations. All that we can do is carry through that process as best as we can. If my hon. Friend is saying that the scrutiny adopted by Parliament to deal with legislation is not as effective as it should be, I have some sympathy with that view. I was a member of the Jopling Committee last year that considered reform of the sittings of the House. I should like that reform to go a little further.<br><br>
I hope that I have been able to reassure my hon. Friend about the regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will now deal with the regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I have reassured my hon. Friend about amendments to existing regulations, which you, Mr. O'Hara, with your usual perception, have realised that I am about to consider.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not take us away from the business before us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure you, Mr. O'Hara, that I shall not do anything of the sort. I merely wanted to point out to the Minister that all Minsters say what he has just said—all regulations must be scrutinised, but this one, unfortunately, must go forward. That is why the number of regulations has increased so much. I understand the Minister and I shall listen to his reasoning as he unfolds the story.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that intervention, but I shall not pursue that line. I shall move on to the detailed subject matter.<br><br>
I wsh to consider the issues raised by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood), but also by the hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty). I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0167">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
sympathise with the plight of the football team from Falkirk and I hope that it will not be long before it bounces back to the premier league.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a dirty shot.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I have stood on the terraces at Falkirk and have seen an enjoyable match. I hope that it is back in the premier league shortly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not out of it yet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not yet, but should mishap befall the team, I hope that it will soon be back. However, that is another digression.<br><br>
Let us be sharp and detailed. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire said that, to his knowledge, this was the first time that water charges had been detailed. That is not right. Water charges have already been defined in legislation. The need to refine the definitions further is the result of the Water Industry Act 1991 and the need to amend other legislation to bring that into line with the new definitions in that Act.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This point relates directly to water charges. Will claimants in the south-west, where water charges are so high, receive a greater benefit than those in, for example, the north?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's intervention, and some comments of the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, about water charges were slightly off the detail of the regulations. However, I am happy to make some brief comments in response.<br><br>
Water charges will continue to be dealt with, as at present, by way of benefit. In recent years, the water industry has applied pressure in an attempt to get the social security system to underwrite its charges. We are not prepared to do that. Like other utilities, the water industry must develop better methods to assist low-income customers.<br><br>
The water industry was different from other utilities in that, until quite recently, water charges were often paid automatically because they were associated with rates, and so on. That has changed and it must develop more effective systems. There have been reports about this and I have debated the matter in the House.<br><br>
At present, we do not intend to make any changes to the benefits system in respect of the payment of water charges. I give the hon. Gentleman the undertaking that, at all times, I shall keep the matter under review. It has caused, and is causing, concern and I do not lightly dismiss that. However, I am not yet convinced that the way to deal with concern about water charges is to make fundamental changes to the social security system to underwrite changes.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire spoke about regulation 4 and income support for EC nationals. The purpose of the regulation is to put the policy intention beyond doubt in terms of restricting the payment of income support to EC nationals. It deals specifically with the change that we needed to make to legislation following a European Court decision.<br><br>
The rules effectively make clear that, provided that an EC national is genuinely seeking work, he or she will be allowed to stay here for a period of six months and may claim income support. If work has not been found by the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
end of that period, the EC national must leave. Other EC countries vary in how long they allow basic income support to be paid to a work-seeker; some are more generous and others less so. We think that six months is about right.<br><br>
Other persons from abroad—from outside the European Community—have no entitlement to income support, except in urgent cases. The Regulation deals specifically with job-seekers who are EC nationals. That is why the regulation relates to them rather than to other persons from abroad. Definition is, of course, more a matter for the Home Office than for us.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also raised the detailed issue of the maintenance paid to a child with capital in excess of £3,000. This aspect is covered not only in the DWA part of the regulations but elsewhere, in regulation 13.<br><br>
Perhaps I may give the background to the subject. In all the income-related benefits, maintenance payments made to a child, including a young person, are treated as the claimant's income and taken into account subject, when appropriate, to the £15 a week maintenance disregard. Otherwise, a child's income is taken into account only up to the level of that child's personal allowance and any disabled child premium.<br><br>
In all the income-related benefits, when a child also has capital in excess of £3,000, no allowance is made for that child in calculating the claimant's applicable amount—in which case, any income of that child, other than maintenance payments, should be ignored.<br><br>
On the introduction of the reformed schemes, however, this provision was only fully carried forward into income support. In all the other benefits, including council tax benefit, maintenance payments made to a child with capital in excess of £3,000 are treated in the same way as any other income of the child, and are disregarded. That means that when an absent parent pays maintenance for the child to the claimant or partner, this is taken into account in full before the application of the £15 a week maintenance disregard. When it is made payable to a child with capital in excess of £3,000, no account is taken of this. Consequently an inequitable state of affairs has arisen.<br><br>
This amendment restores the original policy intention and ensures that all maintenance payments in respect of a child are treated as the claimant's income and taken into account, irrespective of to whom they are paid and irrespective of whether that child has any capital. Although it is difficult to gauge the extent of any losers, they should be few, as the likelihood of a child having both capital in excess of £3,000 and maintenance which is payable to that child is remote. Any loss will be further minimised because of the introduction, in April 1992, of the £15 disregard of such maintenance payments.<br><br>
Essentially, the amendment brings into line across the benefit structure the provisions that deal with maintenance which is paid directly to a child who has capital in excess of £3,000. It is not, as the hon. Gentleman thought, a penal provision. The numbers of people affected will, we consider, be very small.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why have the regulation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The aim is to bring provisions into line across the board. Otherwise, matters would have been inequitable.<br><br>
I shall now deal with the substantial matter raised by the hon. Member for Witbington, with the support of the hon. Member for Falkirk, East—the jobplan. The hon. Member
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0168">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
for Roxburgh and Berwickshire also mentioned it. I shall not delve too deeply into one or two contentious comments. I am sure that Opposition Members would have hoped that those comments could have been made while unemployment was rising. It is a great relief to all of us on both sides of the House that the unemployment figures have taken the turn that they have for the time being. We are all concerned about unemployment. No one knows, as we come out of the recession, how the unemployment figures will drift over the next few months. I am sure that the general feeling of optimism in the country is reflected on both sides. It is welcomed by Conservative Members. I wish sometimes that it was welcomed in a less churlish spirit by the Opposition.<br><br>
The background, as hon. Members know, is that people unemployed for over two years must attend a mandatory restart course. Those courses offer practical help and advice to the long-term unemployed on job search and encourage them to reappraise the efforts that they are taking to find work. They are not schemes in the sense that, I think, the hon. Member for Falkirk, East meant when he spoke of people being forced on to a scheme. They are courses designed to assist someone who has been unemployed in the long term, and who often has crossed a psychological boundary, and is wondering, "What on earth can I do?" The courses are intended to encourage such people at a difficult time to reappraise their situation and to help them apply. They provide a structure in which unemployed people are offered help in applying for vacancies and are given advice on the training opportunities available which may help them acquire the skills they need to get back to work. The courses have been successful in motivating the unemployed and in encouraging them to accept personal responsibility for their job search.<br><br>
Jobplan workshops will build on the experience of restart and attendance at these will be compulsory for those who have refused other offers of help or who are unsure about what options are open to them. The workshops involve individual assessments and encourage the unemployed to be positive about their job search. They are intended to give a confidence boost to the unemployed and offer positive advice on how they can enhance their job prospects. As with restart, failure to attend will result in a benefit sanction, which will reduce benefit by 40 per cent. or 20 per cent. as appropriate, for the week of the workshop. The workshops are expected to offer help to 300,000 long-term unemployed people in the first year.<br><br>
The change that we have made, to target attention on to those who have been unemployed for 12 months rather than for two years, should be seen by hon. Members on both sides of the House as an improvement, not as a penalty. It is important to target help at those who have been unemployed for 12 months, for three reasons. First, that point is often the change-over between unemployment benefit and income support. Secondly, surveys tend to show that employers regard job applicants who have been unemployed for 12 months as belonging to a separate category of the long-term unemployed. Thirdly, people unemployed for 12 months often have their job goals rather less focused because they have been unemployed for so long. It makes good labour market sense to provide encouragement at that particular psychological time. That is the reason for reducing the two years to 12 months.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
The fact that that is mandatory was questioned. The figures quoted by the hon. Member for Withington show how the sanction is treated. It is not designed to penalise; it is a last resort. We all know that a small proportion of people prefer, for whatever reasons, not to take any help. None of us wish people who are long-term unemployed to miss the chance of enjoying a benefit. Some people need an extra boost. The vast majority do not because they are keen and determined to get back to work—that has been the success of some of the policies adopted. However, that does not apply to some people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to giving people a boost. Everyone would say that people who have been unemployed for a year require a boost. However, such a boost would come better from extra benefit or from an extra incentive to go on a course than from the threat of a penalty. I have had much contact with the long-term unemployed and when people are down they need extra incentives. Instead of a whip, they need more of a carrot. Have such extra incentives, such as extra money, to encourage people to go on courses ever been considered?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is taking me outside the regulations and my ministerial role at the Department of Social Security, although I understand the connection. When discussing social security matters, we often trespass gently into other areas. I am happy to do that, provided that I can remain in areas of my competence.<br><br>
I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, which he should perhaps take up more directly with Ministers in the Department of Employment. The hon. Gentleman will be aware of some Department of Employment schemes in which additions to benefit are given for doing different kinds of works. I take his point, but the obligation on unemployed people who are receiving benefit is to do as much as they can to get back to work. We all accept a duty to look after unemployed people under those conditions. When a scheme is tailor-made and designed to assist long-term unemployed people to reappraise their circumstances, it is right that a sense of obligation is reinforced, if necessary, by a benefit sanction.<br><br>
As the hon. Gentleman made clear, the numbers of people who have suffered benefit loss because of that are small. That shows, first, that the vast majority of people are willing and able to discover the value of the restart and jobplan workshop schemes. Secondly, it shows that the Department of Employment and the Department of Social Security are sympathetic in considering the reasons why people may or may not join such schemes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bradley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain the justification for reducing benefit when there is serious illness in the family?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That need not necessarily apply. When good cause is shown for not attending a course, there is no benefit sanction. If the claimant has an acceptable cause for not attending, no sanction is imposed. If a sanction is imposed, but a member of the claimant's family is seriously ill, the sanction is less. I suspect that the number of occasions when that occurs is rare.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Then why bother?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The reasons that people need not attend a course include taking care of a member of their household who cannot take care of himself or herself when no other
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0169">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
member of the household is available to provide the care and when it is not practical for the claimants to make other arrangements for care.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bradley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me put the question the other way: in what circumstances will the benefit be reduced by 20 per cent when there is serious illness in the family?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Burt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Only in circumstances where good cause had not been shown. In any case where the circumstances are as described by the Hon. Gentleman, if they are brought forward as a reason for not attending a course, my reading of the regulations that govern exemptions for those who would not go on courses is that such circumstances would be covered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bradley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So why have the regulation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A person may produce an entirely different reason for not going on a particular course. In some circumstances, the excuse of looking after the individual may not apply because perhaps another member of the household is able to look after the person who is ill. Therefore, the particular circumstances of the exemption would not be found. A close reading of the reasons for exemption would cover the vast majority of the situations that would worry the hon. Gentleman and myself. The relatively few cases where the sanction has been introduced shows that in cases where there is good reason why a course should not be accepted, there is no compulsion to go.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Bradley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Just so that the Committee is clear about how the regulation is working in practice and as the number of sanctions cases is small, will the Minister supply me with details of those in which there has been a 20 per cent reduction and the argument has been based around serious illness in a household?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall do my best to comply. It may be the other way round; the hon. Gentleman may be at some stage required to let me have evidence of cases where such a thing—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bradley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I asked the question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept the point, but at some stage the hon. Gentleman may be obliged to let me know where he thinks that such a thing may have occurred. I shall find out what evidence we have that might show that the sort of thing that he is concerned about has been found to take place in practice. I suspect that it has not taken place often.<br><br>
I shall return to discussing the regulations. We are trying to encourage people to find a way back into employment. The vast majority will do so of their own accord. Those who are long-term unemployed will recognise the help that they receive from the Employment Service and will do everything that they can to go back to work. However, we all know from our experience that some reject every open hand that is offered to them, although they are few in number. They continue to receive benefit support. In return for the support that society gives, people have an obligation to do whatever they can to assist themselves. That is an obligation that is accepted by most reasonable people and is certainly accepted by the Government. Where that obligation needs to be stiffened, we do it. That is the first part of the sanction and I am happy that it is in place. I am also happy that there are reasonable grounds to allow
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
someone in difficulties not to suffer a benefit sanction. I shall do my best to ensure that the circumstances that the hon. Gentleman described do not happen in practice.<br><br>
I am grateful to have had the opportunity to deal with the questions that have been put.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bradley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister appears to be concluding. He has not tackled the point about people doing valuable voluntary work being forced to give it up to go on a restart course or jobplan course for a week, possibly breaking a valuable link with potential for full-time employment. Will the Minister comment on that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can only comment on that within my departmental remit and after occasional sudden flashes of inspiration. The unemployed may do voluntary work as long as they remain available for work after a period of 24 hours' notice and they actively seek work. Doing voluntary work does not exempt them from having to meet the conditions of entitlement or from having to attend courses designed to help them back into work. This is a matter for the Department of Employment.<br><br>
When a person is doing voluntary work which fits in with his long-term aim of returning to work, there will be no suggestion that a particular course or workshop might be appropriate. People may get themselves trapped in a hole, so their prospects are not being improved, and a short break may help. People could return to what they were previously doing—there is no problem—but finding another way to examine their circumstances, to see how they might be a helped back into work may be beneficial. There may be circumstances in which they are not able to see that, but those who advise the long-term unemployed and see the position from a slightly more objective point of view may have a point in asking someone to attend a workshop or a restart course rather than continue in voluntary work in the manner suggested. We are talking about a short break, not a complete change of direction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bradley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to labour the point. However, it is strange that, according to circular 395/1 from the Employment Service, not the Department of Social Security, a claimant doing voluntary work
<br><blockquote><p>"should be asked to make arrangement to forgo this for the workshop".</p></blockquote>
That places emphasis on giving up voluntary work and attending the workshop even though the workshop may have no relevance to claimants because they are doing important voluntary work. Will the Minister take the matter up with the Department of Employment to try to ensure that people undertaking voluntary work suffer from no financial penalty on their income support if they decide to continue with that valuable work?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly draw it to the attention of my colleagues in the Department of Employment. However, there will be circumstances in which an outside advisor can see a potential improvement in someone's job opportunities through attending workshop and receiving the advice and counselling that is available there and that that would be more useful than staying in voluntary work for a short time. Therefore, it is a good provision because it creates a more objective way to examine circumstances. The distinction that we have drawn is right.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0170">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to come to the aid of the Minister. Before I came into the House, I was a social worker and a youth leader. It is rather strange that Labour Members are asking a Conservative Minister about voluntary work and that the Minister is defending the need of the state to run courses. The Minister is right. Voluntary work is very cosy, and comfortable, although important, so that those in it are not inspired to go out and seek paid work. The balance must be right. I do not know whether the balance is yet right, but the Minister has taken the right approach.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the Minister replies, I request hon. Members to pursue this matter any further. We have stretched it to its limit. My tolerance of what I recognise is a difficult matter of interface between the Department of Employment and the Minister's Department has been strained. I ask that there are no more interventions on that matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Both sides of the Committee are extremely grateful to you, Mr. O'Hara, for your patience. You are right to say that there are occasions when regulations touch upon the affairs of other Departments. In such cases it is almost impossible to discuss sensibly the background to a regulation and that creates difficulty for a Minister, who has to stretch his knowledge of other Departments a little further than he thought he would have to. I am grateful for the indulgence of both sides of the Committee when I stray out of my normal area in an effort to provide the background to the measure.<br><br>
In a pithy and concise intervention, my hon. Friend the Member for South Hams said what I precisely wished to convey to the hon. Member for Withington. I hope that the hon. Gentleman acknowledges that the grounds for the distinction are reasonable.<br><br>
I shall conclude by briefly describing the other regulations that we have not touched on and I shall illustrate the way in which the package has been put together. The regulations have offered us an opportunity to revise legislation that has proved to be technically flawed or liable to misinterpretation. They also allow for the continuing process of aligning, as far as possible, all the income-related benefits, and I make particular reference to child maintenance.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
I am sure that the Committee will welcome the beneficial measures contained in the regulations. The higher disregard for carers, which we did not touch on, will enable them to earn a little more and keep in touch with work. The disregards that we have introduced into family credit and disability working allowance will benefit those in receipt of guardian's allowance and those receiving arrears of child maintenance.<br><br>
Regulation 8 increases the earning disregard for carers in receipt of the income support carers premium from £5 to £15. That change, also reflected in housing benefit and council tax benefit, will give additional help to up to 2,500 people who wish to work alongside their caring commitment. Regulations 11 and 17 provide for the changes that I have mentioned in the treatment of maintenance in family credit and disability working allowance.<br><br>
The regulations are in the main technical or remove ambiguity when legislation lends itself to more than one interpretation. Others provide beneficial improvements. I hope that I have been able to deal with the majority of the Committee's concerns. I have pleasure in commending the regulations to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before I put the question, I should put on record that whereas there has been general agreement that it was helpful to the Committee to a reasonable extent to touch on regulations of another Department where they met the regulations of the Minister's Department, members of the Committee should appropriately make general remarks on procedure to the Select Committee on Procedure.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p><i>That the Committee has considered the Income-Related Benefits Schemes (Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 1993 (S.I., 1993, No. 315).</i></p></blockquote></p>
