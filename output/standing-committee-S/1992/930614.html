Draft Criminal Justice Act 1988 (Designated Countries and Territories) (Amendment) Order 1993 and the draft Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1986 (Designated Countries and Territories) (Amendment) Order 1993 and the draft Criminal Justice (International Co- operation) Act 1990 (Enforcement of Overseas Forfeiture Orders) (Amendment) Order 1993</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.33 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. David Maclean)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Criminal Justice Act 1988 (Designated Countries and Territories) (Amendment) Order 1993.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With the agreement of the Committee, it will be convenient to discuss at the same time the other two orders before us, namely, the draft Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1986 (Designated Countries and Territories) (Amendment) Order 1993 and the draft Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act 1990 (Enforcement of Overseas Forfeiture Orders) (Amendment) Order 1993.</span></p>
<p>4.34 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Cook, for the opportunity to ask the Minister to tell us the reasons for the designation of specific countries in the three orders. In some cases, that is obvious—for example, in relation to the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics—but in other cases, it is not so obvious and it would be helpful if the Minister outlined the reasoning behind the selection of countries.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maclean</span><span class='membercontribution'>: By all means. The way in which we select countries depends on several factors. Plainly, we wish to target countries that are major financial centres; others will be important as major drug producers or transit countries. However, the overriding principle is that it is essential that such countries should have in place legislation that is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
compatible with our own before any amendment can be concluded. Therefore, yes, one day soon we should like to add some other countries to the list and negotiations are under way.<br><br>
I do not suggest that this list is exhaustive of the top priorities. Of course, some top priorities are included, as are other countries that are lesser priorities. We have managed speedily to conclude agreements. We shall continue trying to conclude agreements with other countries where our advisers, especially the police, recommend that agreements would be satisfactory and sensible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister satisfied that, in the case of each country designated in the order, the legislation is appropriate and suitable? In relation to countries where there is simply a change in the arrangements—the former eastern European countries—are the arrangements in the new country suitable now, as presumably they were at the time of the original designation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maclean</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, sir. That is an essential requirement of these orders. We should not have brought them this far if we were not content that there were satisfactory legal arrangements in the countries that we are designating.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Criminal Justice Act 1988 (Designated Countries and Territories) (Amendment) Order 1993.</p></blockquote></p>
