National Health Service (Fund-holding Practices) Regulations 1993</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Dawn Primarolo <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the National Health Service (Fund-holding Practices) Regulations 1993 (S.I., 1993, No. 567).</p></blockquote>
The regulations deal with general practitioner fundholding, the principle of which we have consistently opposed. We believe that it introduces a two-tier system into the health service whereby patients of GP fundholders can get treatment in advance of the patients of non-fundholders. That decision is taken regardless of clinical need and simply on the basis of which GP a patient is registered with.<br><br>
The cost of fundholding has already been a massive £94.8 million for only 11 per cent, of GPs. If all GPs were fundholders, it would cost an extra £846 million. Fundholding costs 122 times as much as a more effective joint commissioning process between GPs and district health authorities. Fundholders in 1991–92—the first year of fundholding—made an average profit of £44,000. The regulations are supposed to deal with some of the anomalies that have arisen from the operation of the existing scheme.<br><br>
Fundholders were given more money for computers than ordinary GPs. Each fundholder spends an average £12,500 in the private sector. Fundholding damages the unique relationship between the family doctor and his or her patient. The former president of the National Association of Fundholding Practices, who advised the Government on fundholding, has said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The expansion of the fundholding scheme posed a growing threat to hospital services".</p></blockquote>
A recent article in the <i>General Practitioner</i> referred to twin blows to the survival of fundholders. It quoted the Audit Commission report published a week ago which stopped short—but only just—of calling for the scrapping of the GP fundholding scheme. The commission considered it undemocratic and unaccountable. It was concerned because the funds could not be traced. The commission was worried about the absence of mechanisms to ensure that general practitioners' purchasing activities were consistent with the health needs of the whole population. It recommended closer co-operation with the family health services authority and called for increased FHSA influence over fundholders.<br><br>
The second blow came from the primary care manager of the Wessex regional health authority, who said that the budget set in process is too crude. He alleged that some fundholding GPs were secretly agreeing with hospitals to present inflated treatment prices for their patients so that the GP could make more profit from the fundholding budget. The regulations claim to deal with some of those abuses, but they do not.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
Paragraph 22(2) on page 12 represents an apparent climb-down by the Government on the savings on salaries for staff made by GP fundholders. GPs are making large profits by such savings. For Example, I have a copy of the Oxford regional health authority returns for GP fundholders, which show that the largest savings were made on staff budgets. The arrangement was that 70 per cent, of staff funding would be paid by the FHSA and 30 per cent, paid by the GP. If GPs get rid of their staff after they have agreed the budget, they make a 30 per cent, profit on every member of staff. In the Oxford regional health authority £193,619 was saved by cutting staff budgets after the arrangements had been agreed. Paragraph 22(2) does not deal specifically with that problem. It alludes to the fact that the scam has been taking place, but that hole is still not plugged.<br><br>
Paragraph 23 on page 13 was trumpeted as a triumph in dealing with the problems in GP fund-holding practices. It relates to the companies that have been set up. But it does not prevent the GP fundholder working for his limited company, which pays him, via the company, to undertake work. Paragraph 23 does not deal specifically with that and does not stop that situation developing. Even after the regulations have been implemented, GP fundholders will be able to refer patients to limited companies, private hospitals and private health care facilities, in which he, she, another partner in that practice, or the spouse of a partner in that practice holds shares and, therefore, stands to gain financially. Do the regulations prohibit GP fundholders from referring patients to private hospitals or to other facilities from which the GP stands to gain financially?<br><br>
Finally, paragraph 24 on page 13 legitimises GP fundholders' keeping the profit that they make from then-practices and investing it in a way that indirectly increases their net income. Far from sorting out the problems of GP fundholding, which is fundamentally flawed, the regulations provide for further scams and rip-offs with the money that goes through GP fundholders.<br><br>
How many GP limited companies are there? Will the Minister take steps to abolish those companies and ensure proper regulation of the money? How many GP fundholding companies have been investigated; and what is the Minister doing about GP fundholders who have been shown to be misusing the scheme? What steps will he take to investigate the allegations made by the primary care manager of Wessex regional health authority that fiddles are being worked in the over-pricing of treatment to provide profit that the GP fundholder retains? That is happening at a time when the rest of the health service is racked by a shortage of finance.<br><br>
Until those questions are answered, and until the Minister can demonstrate that there is not a two-tier health service in which people receive quicker treatment if they go to the 11 per cent, of GPs in a privileged position, we shall continue to oppose such regulations. The principle of GP fund holding is an attempt to break the back of the national health service's doctrine, which is that it is available on the basis of need, not of ability to pay. Another principle of the NHS is that it is available on an equal basis. The fundamental relationship between a GP and his or her patient—that of an advocate—must not be undermined by the conflict of interest that clearly exist in the financial arrangements for GP fundholders.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
<p>4.41 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Heeley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to say a few words in support of my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Ms. Primarolo). All I have to say to the Government is, "We told you so." Opposition Members are in a Catch-22 position. When the legislation was established, we told the Government exactly what would go wrong, why it was wrong in principle, why it would not help the national health service, and so on. The regulations are trying to undo the mistakes made in the original legislation. As my hon. Friend said, unfortunately they do not. Hopefully, we shall not only criticise the concept of the regulations, but register our protest in a vote at the end of the debate.<br><br>
There are further scams. We are still dealing with the Government's dogma that, for some strange reason, such profit motivation must continue in the health service. That goes against the principle of the health service, and we are now left with the regulation. The explanatory note to the regulations at the bottom of page 19 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The regulations contain new provision for the recovery of misapplied sums including the procedure to be followed by the Regional Health Authority and appeal to the Secretary of State (regulation 25)."</p></blockquote>
As I said earlier, "We told you so". Since the idea was first mooted, we told the Government what would happen. We were ignored then and, no doubt, the warnings that we are expressing now will be ignored, too. The regulations will not cure the problem. The only way in which that can be done is for the Government to go back to the drawing board and, hopefully, return to a properly established national health service in which GPs operate under the old system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ken Purchase <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wolverhampton, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the contention of my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South about surpluses. I wish to deal with the problem of the influence that may be exerted by doctors in one practice who are perhaps on the board of, or serve in an advisory capacity to, a Nuffield establishment, which may be competing for the work that they wish to send on. My hon. Friend will be aware that a practice in the West Midlands had a surplus of more than £100,000. That was the largest surplus in the United Kingdom, but there is a strong feeling in the West Midlands that the part of the national health service that we are discussing is discriminating against urban areas with medical pathology far worse than found generally throughout the rest of the country. Measured by simple criteria such as infant mortality and general mortality rates, the West Midlands always features in the bottom half of any league table.<br><br>
Because the first lines of competition were drawn when, I believe, 10,000 patients had to be on a list before a practice could go to fundholding, many practices in urban areas such as mine, which could not possibly have coped with 10,000 patients in any event, were left at the starting line. Of course, it is wrong that there should be such a competition for medical funds; none the less, the outcome has been that many urban areas have been significantly damaged by the policy of the Government.<br><br>
As for whether doctors setting up a private company may also be advisers to a Nuffield or other private hospital, company law covers the position of people who are known as shadow directors—those who act as advisers without necessarily being company directors. If a private hospital
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
runs into financial difficulty and decides that the way out is to hike up the prices charged to each fundholder, who may also be serving directly as a director in a shadow capacity, what action would the Government take? Such cases may not be entirely fictitious and it may not be too long before they arise.<br><br>
Many managers are considering whether to offer private facilities in national health service trust hospitals. That would inevitably lead to a downturn in trade for the Nuffield and other private institutions. In turn, that may leave fundholding doctors with any connection to the private sector in a position in which they either vote for a price hike for their practices or see the institution to which they have nailed their colours fail.<br><br>
I ask the Minister to tell us what would be the position of GPs acting as directors in a limited company who also act as advisers to a private hospital.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Tom Sackville)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am always staggered by attacks made by the Labour party on fundholding, which I regard as one of the great advances made in the NHS, in terms not only of primary care but of hospital care and the clout that family doctors now have in relation to the providers. Fundholding is having a marked effect on their patients and it is spreading to the patients of non-fundholding practices, the numbers of which are declining sharply—as we see from the figures of those which are getting together in consortia for the fourth wave of fund-holding.<br><br>
The instrument that we are debating brings together and clarifies many earlier sets of regulations and builds on the achievements of fundholding. In one positive addition, it extends the scope of the scheme to include community nursing, which is a considerable advance. There are a number of misapprehensions about fundholding, which we heard reinforced today by Opposition Members. Whether they are based on a wilful desire to ignore the benefits of what is going on or on simple political prejudice, this is not the moment to argue; but fundholding is not about queue-jumping or giving doctors' practices the chance improperly to divert money. It is about giving the clinician closest to the patient—the family doctor—a greater opportunity to influence the quality of service that his or her patient receives from providers. It puts doctors in an entirely different position vis-à-vis providers. It is about delivering better care for patients and better value for money.<br><br>
Let me give one or two examples. Many fundholders are establishing clinics in their surgeries, which avoids the necessity of a trip to hospital for physiotherapy, chiropody and counselling of all sorts. That cuts waiting times at the hospital and the need to travel—particularly valuable to elderly patients. Many fundholders have negotiated better-quality services than hospitals. They have caused the setting of new standards, which have then been applied to the patients of all other practices. They have brought about shorter waiting times because hospitals have had to change their procedures as a result of pressure from fundholders.<br><br>
With regard to value for money, there is much talk about profit, which is deeply insulting to many of the doctors concerned. All the surpluses are ploughed back into patient care. If there is any doubt about that, close monitoring is carried out by regional health authorities. If there is absolute disagreement, regional health authorities can withdraw the scheme from any practice.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0573">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Purchase</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may be missing the point. The fact that more than £100,000 remained in the coffers of one practice in the West Midlands did not mean simply that the practice was free to do whatever it wanted with that £100,000; it meant that many other acute needs were left unmet, although funds from taxation were available to our national health service. The aim should be the efficient and effective distribution of those resources to meet the most needy cases first. Where surpluses are retained in a practice, it clearly is not an option for the regional or district health authority to reallocate those resources, perhaps to avoid the ending of cold surgery—an important matter for many—in February of any year. But the additional money—£100,000—would provide another 80 hip replacements in Wolverhampton.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sackville</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree that there may be problems with budget setting, but that does not affect the principle that fundholding practices are finding considerable value-for-money savings. Those are being made from expenditure that was unnecessary or of no benefit to patients and which can be redirected to benefit patients.<br><br>
In 1991–92 four per cent, savings overall were found, which were then available to be ploughed back for patient benefit. Those savings were achieved through greater efficiency, not through cuts in service.<br><br>
Let me point out an aspect that has not been mentioned—prescribing practice. Many fundholders have said that they now have an entirely new attitude to prescribing. Many people are being treated by fundholders by counselling instead of by the use or, in many cases, abuse of anti-depressants. In a week in which one major benzodiazepine has had its licence revoked by the Medicines Control Agency, that is a topical and germane point. To anyone who believes, as I do, that there has been a great deal of misguided prescribing, it is important that for the first time many practices will have a real incentive carefully to examine their prescribing practices.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Audrey Wise <span class='memberconstituency'>(Preston)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain why good prescribing practice depends on GPs being fundholders, and what attempts are being made to ensure that all GPs employ good prescribing practice? Only a minority of practices are fundholding. Will he also explain why or whether the shorter waiting times obtained for hospital treatment for fundholding practices is at the expense of patients of non-fundholding practices?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sackville</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I put a similar question to fundholders themselves—why were they not able to find those savings before? The answer perhaps lies in human nature, but it is nonetheless a fact that prescribing by fundholding practices has gone up at a lower rate than prescribing by non-fundholding practices. I do not know whether it is because the mind is more focused by the budgetary arrangements on the cost of drugs, but that is the effect. I think that it is a salutary one.<br><br>
A great deal of misapprehension surrounds lack of accountability, and it was reflected in the speech of the hon. Member for Bristol, South. The regulations clearly set out the responsibility of fundholders to manage their funds effectively, the consequences of failing to do so are clearly laid out—that is, expulsion from the scheme. I believe that as yet there has been only one such expulsion.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
It has been alleged that fundholders can divert NHS funds improperly. The regulations demonstrate that that is a fiction. Fundholders may make savings by improving efficiency, but the regulations state unambiguously that such savings must be used only for the benefit of patients.<br><br>
To answer the point of the hon. Member for Bristol, South, paragraph 20(6) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Regional Health Authority shall not consent to the purchase of any goods or services from a provider with which a member of the practice is connected unless it is satisfied that no member of the practice will receive any payment from the allotted sum, whether directly or indirectly, which is wholly or mainly attributable to treatment given to individuals who are on the lists of patients of members of the practice".</p></blockquote>
If that regulation is broken, the ultimate sanction exists—expulsion from the scheme.<br><br>
I shall return to the major change introduced by the regulations—the inclusion of community nursing in the fund. It is a great step forward and it will engender an environment that will lead to a much needed improvement in communications between doctors and nurses working in the community.<br><br>
Fundholding is a major engine for change in the NHS. Its benefits will be enormous and it will be very beneficial to patients. I commend the regulations.</span></p>
<p>4.58 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Wise</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I draw attention to the fact that the Minister, as far as I heard, did not answer the question about hospital waiting times for patients of fundholding practices? Fundholding practice patients get preferential treatment, which can only be at the expense of other patients of other practices. I ask the Minister again to deal with that point. It is no use improving the situation for a minority of patients at the expense of the majority. That seems to be what happens. It is clear that there is a two-tier system of waiting times based not on clinical need but on the fundholding status of the GP.<br><br>
Will the Minister also enlighten us as to how the Department is certain that the influence on the drug bill is due to better prescribing practice? That is not self-evident, although I hope that it is true. No one wants drugs prescribed to an excessive degree. A reduction in the number of drugs prescribed could be achieved simply by depriving patients of the drugs they require. What steps does the Department take to ensure that prescribing practice is improved in the way he asserts, and not through other means? If he is able to monitor the situation, why cannot monitoring be done in all prescribing practices to ensure better professional practice—without having to resort to the dubious method of fundholding?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Sackville</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of all the fears about two-tier services. In many cases, the local purchaser—the district health authority—has come to the end of its budget for elective surgery and yet some fundholding practices in the area still have funds because of the different way in which they have managed their budgets. We have witnessed that unfortunate occurrence in the past few months. We want to ensure that, by better management of their resources during the year, district health authorities do not find themselves in this position in future. As to prescribing, we have to trust the professional judgment of all doctors to prescribe the drugs that they believe their patients need. We have no evidence that doctors are cutting back improperly but plenty of evidence from surveys that, contrary to many
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0574">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
fears that have been expressed, fundholders have started to prescribe expensive drugs that they did not prescribe before they were fundholders. No evidence suggests a diminution in the quality or appropriateness of drugs prescribed. I am certain that the focus on the costs of drugs—it could be argued that all GPs should already focus on them and has been beneficial for GP fundholders. I hope that, in future, most GP practices will be involved in a fundholding scheme or consortium. We shall then see the benefits from that involvement spread more widely.</span></p>
