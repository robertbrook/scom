	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='legislation'>DRAFT ADVICE AND ASSISTANCE (FINANCIAL CONDITIONS) (SCOTLAND) REGULATIONS 1992</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Advice and Assistance (Financial Conditions) (Scotland) Regulations 1992.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is the wish of the Committee, we will consider also the draft Civil Legal Aid (Financial Conditions) (Scotland) Regulations 1992 and the draft Advice and Assistance (Assistance by way of Representation) (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 1992.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first two sets of regulations provide for the uprating of the financial eligibility limits for civil legal aid and for advice and assistance. They adjust the financial limits to take account of inflation and to reflect changes in the level of social security benefits. Corresponding increases have recently been made in England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third set of regulations provides for the extension of legal assistance by way of representation to cover unopposed petitions for the appointment of an executor under the Act of Sederunt (Confirmation of Executors) 1964.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee might find it helpful if I briefly describe each of the regulations. The Civil Legal Aid (Financial Conditions) (Scotland) Regulations 1992 raise the lower disposable income limit for civil legal aid—that is the level below which no contribution from income is payable—from £2,860 to £3,060 a year. The regulations also increase the upper income limit—that is, the level above which legal aid is not normally available—from £6,350 to £6,800 a year. The upper capital limit—above which legal aid is not normally available—is increased from £6,310 to £6,750. There is no change in the lower limit of £3,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Advice and Assistance (Financial Conditions) (Scotland) Regulations 1992 increase the weekly disposable income above which a person is required to pay a contribution to legal advice and assistance from £64 to £70 and they also prescribe the scale of contributions to be paid when weekly disposable income exceeds £75 but not £145. The capital limit above which advice and assistance is not available increases from £935 to £1,000. The scale of contributions for applicants with disposable income between the upper and lower income limit for advice and assistance is also changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed changes represent an increase of seven per cent. which matches the uprating level of income-related social security benefits. The eligibility limits remain in line with the corresponding limits in England and Wales. As recipients of income support and other income-related benefit are permitted to have £3,000 in disposable capital
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
before any income is assumed to be generated which could affect the level of benefit paid, it is sensible to continue to use that limit as the threshold for capital contributions for legal aid. That is why the lower capital limit remains unchanged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Advice and Assistance (Assistance by way of Representation) (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 1992 amend the principal 1988 regulations to allow the ABWOR scheme to be used in relation to petitions for the appointment of an executor to a deceased person under the Act of Sederunt (Confirmation of Executors) 1964. To date, that could be achieved only by way of full civil legal aid—a more time-consuming, expensive, and less flexible system for the client.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The above regulations are intended to come into force on 1 July 1992.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have introduced a large number of other necessary reforms, none of which hve been prayed against. They have all been generally welcomed, so I will not refer to them unless members of the Committee so wish. I hope that I have explained in sufficient detail the objectives set out in the Legal Aid (Financial Conditions) (Scotland) Regulations and our proposals to improve various aspects of the administration of legal aid in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.34 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian Wilson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cunninghame, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is always useful to debate changes in legal aid to ensure that certain points are made about its availability and to question the Government about the gradual erosion of its availability. From their constituency work and general awareness, Opposition Members—and some Conservative Members—would agree that legal aid should be available in many civil cases, but either it is not available or it is inadequate. Further erosion, however slight, is to be deplored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall not oppose the regulations, for obvious reasons. Although the legal profession and its clients may not regard them as particularly satisfactory, it would be more unsatisfactory if the regulations were not introduced. They have already been delayed by the general election and will come into force on 1st July instead of 1st April.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall cite one figure to demonstrate the erosion that is occurring. The weekly sum of £145 is the upper limit proposed for eligibility for legal aid. People with a disposable income of £145 a week, which is not a king's ransom, will have to meet costs of up to £75. That is a significant amount for someone in that income range and, in some cases, it will be a prohibitive amount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In case people think otherwise, the rise from £ 135 to £ 145 is not arrived at on an annual basis. That £10 increase covers the 28-month period from 9th April 1990, when that sum was last revised, until July 1992.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During that 28-month period, the figure rose by only £10. I checked this morning whether that was in line with the increase in the retail prices index; if it were, the sum would have increased by not £10 to £145 but £15 to £150. I admit that that is not as spectacular a difference as I expected, but it is another £5 of disposable income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within that range, people are excluded from receiving legal aid; it has a salami effect if, each time that we consider the regulations, another fiver is lopped off the eligibility ceiling. Fewer and fewer people will have access to legal aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0450">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

I do not want to weary the Committee by speaking about each of the sums, but the general principle is the same. The Minister should acknowledge that the figures do not rise in line with inflation or the RPI. They are increasing by less than that and the availability of legal aid is thus reduced. I obtained my figures from the Library, so they should be accepted as coming from a neutral source. Throughout the regulations, less than the going rate of inflation has been applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures refer, of course, to disposable income. Will the Minister say what is counted as disposable income? What costs are deducted from gross income to arrive at a figure for disposable income? Is there any room for discussion on how those figures are calculated? As the Minister said, the English proposals are virtually identical, so there is no particular Scottish point to be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will not oppose the regulations, but we place on record our belief that the availability of civil legal aid, like that of criminal legal aid, should be expanded. Instead, it is being contracted—however marginally. Having said that, I support the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to be able to respond to the hon. Gentleman's comments about the erosion of legal aid. The sums have increased enormously over the years. In 1990–91, there were 280,000 accounts for legal aid, advice and assistance—approximately 65 per cent. more than were paid five years ago. Annual provision of grant for the legal aid fund has risen from £15 million in 1980 to £64 million in 1990–91. That was demand led and I believe that it will continue. Indications are that the total for 1991–92 will be £76 million, so the sums have increased enormously. The difficulty remains that there must be a cut-off point and whoever just misses entitlement will obviously be disappointed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister acknowledges that his argument—which I accept—does not contradict my own. I recognise that the gross sums paid out in legal aid have increased substantially. However, I suggest that the way to limit it is not by eroding the income criteria that qualify one for legal aid. I hope that the Minister recognises that those two points do not conflict.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will come in a moment to the hon. Gentleman's particular point about income. I make the general point that a review is being made of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
whole subject of legal aid. We are aware of the concerns that have been expressed and that comprehensive review on eligibility is taking place throughout the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Various options for improving elegibility for civil, non-matrimonial legal aid are being evaluated and a discussion paper on eligibility for criminal legal aid is due to be published later this year. Arrangements for the review will ensure that Scotland's distinctive interests and needs will be taken fully into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to how levels of increase are determined, eligibility limits for legal aid are generally uprated by the same percentage as income-related social security benefits—that is, the RPI excluding housing. The figure for this year is 7 per cent. The general uprating of eligibility limits of legal aid does not include a housing component, because estimated housing costs are deducted fom disposable income in the assesssment of eligibility of individual cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The calculation of disposable income looks at the particular circumstances of the individual. There is the difficulty that ultimately the line must be drawn somewhere and that is one of the key issues being considered in the current legal aid review. I believe it is very important that we help to ensure that legal advice, aid, and assistance are available to those who most need it. I shall bear in mind the honourable Gentleman's comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
