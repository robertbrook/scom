	<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Peter Lloyd)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Draft Civil Defence (General Local Authority Functions) Regulations 1993.</p></blockquote>
With the ending of the cold war and, with it, the ever-present threat of sustained nuclear attack which has hung over us for a generation, we do not, thank God, now have to be so fully prepared to deal with the after-effects of such an onslaught.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations, therefore, repeal the various orders which, since the Civil Defence Act 1948, was introduced by a Labour Government, have placed duties on local authorities in respect of such a nuclear conflagration. Many potential disasters and emergencies, however, from a plane crashing in a built-up area to outbreaks of disease, can happen in war and peace, and a local authority ought always to be ready to respond speedily and effectively to them. Most local authorities make wide provision for that, but the range and quality of that provision varies, and there is a continuing need to place a broad duty on local authorities, so that their general responsibility is clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, thus, a case for new legislation to replace the 1948 Act with an up-to-date expression of what is now needed. I certainly do not rule out a new Act at some time in the future. I stress, however, that in the foreseeable future there will not be sufficient time in the parliamentary legislative programme to enable that to happen. Even if such time could be found, it would not be particularly sensible so to legislate while the structure of local government is under review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the meantime, the Government are placing under the regulations a general duty on local authorities to make such plans to meet emergencies and disasters as they judge necessary or which might be requested by the Home Secretary. The Government will be issuing guidance on the arrangements that local authorities might make to cover a range of possibilities. In the first instance, it will be very much a matter for local authorities to exercise their own judgment on what is needed in respect of detailed plans, training and provision of facilities. The measure will be essentially flexible, with the local authority being the prime mover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In due course, the Government will be reviewing with local authorities how they are discharging their responsibilities. If the Home Secretary considers that there are significant gaps in the plans of local authorities, he may under the regulations request an authority to take such steps as he believes necessary to ensure that the plans can be, or are, implemented. He may also issue directions on any matter covered by the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
I emphasise that the Government regard such matters as first and foremost for local authorities to apply. The Secretary of State does not intend to rush in with a barrage of requests and directives. Indeed, any that he does bring in will be introduced after consultation and made rarely and with reluctance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.34 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you, Mr. Jones to the Chair. It is the first time that I have had the pleasure of being a member of a Committee under your chairmanship, and I am sure that it will be a pleasure on this and many other occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When introducing the statutory instrument, the Minister referred to change and to the reasons for change, but he did not explain the inadequacy of the regulations as a vehicle for what he acknowledged is required. The Minister said that there was a need for an up-to-date expression of legislative requirements. He is right about that, but what I find difficult to understand is his statement that there will be no new primary legislation in the foreseeable future. The parliamentary timetable is not an adequate reason for that. I appreciate that the Government are in something of a tangle in this Session, even though it is an extended one, caused by the Maastricht Bill, but an assurance that they intended to introduce legislation in the next Session would have been welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister said, the issue needs to be cleared up. Structural change in local authorities is not an adequate excuse. Local authority matters are always in a state of flux. What is happening in England in particular means that there will be a rolling programme. That strikes me as a recipe for delay, so it might be appropriate for the Minister to consider introducing legislation to deal with civil defence that would cope with changes in local government structures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system, as it appears under the regulations and in the present relationship between central and local government, looks flexible to the point of being floppy. The Minister spoke about the Home Secretary meeting local authorities to discuss how they exercised their responsibilities, which places the strain of responsibility very much on local authorities. Clearly, local authorities have a responsibility. They are elected by local people and have the best understanding of needs in their area, both in anticipating disasters and dealing with them when they occur. But we must consider how the Government are exercising their responsibilities and setting about enabling local authorities to do the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The former Home Secretary made a statement on 12 November 1992, from which these changes spring. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government will continue to make a contribution to local emergency preparedness through civil defence grants to local authorities. In future this support will be aimed at encouraging a general emergency preparedness capable of responding to all kinds of emergencies, whatever their cause."</p></blockquote>
Clearly, that is necessary, but it is an extremely bland statement. Since November, there has not been much clarity on the part of the Government. There is nothing objectionable in the regulations, but they are an inadequate response to the need to change and they do not fully carry through the Home Secretary's remarks. That is another mark of the legacy of confusion and neglect that the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) left
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0579">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
behind him after his exceedingly poor tenancy of the office of Home Secretary. I have some sympathy for the Minister who must clear up the mess that has been left behind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the Government's responsibilities towards disasters. I refer to the answer given by the Minister who is here today to my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley) when he asked about publishing
	<br><blockquote><p>"an account of progress in the implementation of recommendations made after major disasters as recommended in the Hayes report on river safety."</p></blockquote>
The Minister replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There are no plans to publish such an account. Efforts are concentrated on dissimulating lessons learnt from disasters through incorporation into suitable guidance."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 11 May 1993; Vol. 224, c. 	<i>36344.</i>]</p></blockquote>
We require both primary and secondary legislation to clarify the respective responsibilities of central and local government in such a way as to ensure that a proper system is put in place. That is what the statutory instrument is supposed to be about—but it performs the task inadequately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem for local authorities is that although the instrument clarifies responsibilities, to an extent, at local authority level, central Government responsibilities remain dreadfully fragmented. Local authority responsibilities depend on those central Government responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a variety of responsibilities: the control of industrial major accident hazard lies with the Health and Safety Executive in the Department of Employment; problems following the Chernobyl disaster are the responsibility of the Department of Trade and Industry, the Department of the Environment or, in certain circumstances, the Ministry of Defence; transport accidents and emergencies involve the Department of Transport and, in certain circumstances the Welsh Office and the Scottish Office; industrial accidents are covered not by the Department of Trade and Industry nor even by President of the Board of Trade but by the Department of Employment. Local authorities, which play a key role, as the Minister acknowledged, and which often have to clear up the mess after an incident, are covered by the Department of the Environment; emergency planning—police and fire services—are the responsibility of the Home Office, except in Scotland where the Scottish Office is responsible for local authority emergency services and emergency planning, although through different departments. Medical response to an emergency is a matter for the Department of Health or the Scottish Office, but if the incident involves food supplies, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food takes the lead. In Wales, the responsibility for a few of those matters is not clear. In carrying out the responsibilities set out in the statutory instrument, local authorities face a fragmented, disorganised and confused situation at national level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want the Minister to make a statement about the longer-term situation. The statutory instrument might be all right as a stop-gap but what is required, as the Minister recognised, is a full analysis and review of the arrangements of the country's emergency planning requirements, with legislation to follow. The Minister seemed to suggest that the stop-gap would be with us for some time. That is a missed opportunity. I hope that the Minister will announce an intention to review the time scale and to meet the need
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
for comprehensive legislation, in view of the major changes recognised in a statement in the House and in his introduction to the instrument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to shift to dealing with peacetime rather than wartime issues. That is given new urgency by every flood and local disaster. I know that you, Mr. Jones, in a previous sphere of responsibility, took great interest in the floods which affected north Wales only a couple of years ago. Those floods were devastating for those involved and extremely difficult for the local authorities to cope with. Similar incidents have occurred in parts of Wales recently. Neither the framework nor the resources are adequate. The statutory instrument does not satisfactorily fill the gap to ensure that adequate preparation and systems are in place to deal with emergencies and public safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another recent example, the Warrington bombings, placed enormous strains on the capacity of local authorities to respond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I chaired a local authority finance committee and worked as a community worker providing help on emergency planning and in practice, on drought and snow emergencies. I cannot stress enough importance of planning and of having resources adequately deployed well in advance, rather than dealing with issues after the event.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is that there is no proper framework for emergency preparedness in the United Kingdom. Local authorities are not under a statutory duty to plan for peacetime emergencies. The only money paid directly to local authorities for emergency planning is earmarked for preparations against hostile attack and can only be spent second hand on peacetime emergency planning, should an authority decide to do so. The function is inadequately resourced. The draft regulations do nothing to change materially that unsatisfactory state of affairs, despite the opportunity for the Government to protect public safety by trasferring money from wartime to peacetime planning, as well as providing a proper framework for such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the array of legislation, the only duty to carry specific funding is that under the Civil Defence Act 1948. Local authorities are empowered to use moneys for planning for peacetime disasters only under the Civil Protection in Peacetime Act 1986, which was a private Members Bill, promoted, with Government backing, by the honourable Member for Upminster (Sir N. Bonsor). It belatedly and only partially fulfilled a commitment in the 1983 Conservative party general election manifesto.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft regulations propose that in non-metropolitan counties the principal civil defence functions will remain with the county councils. In metropolitan areas, however, such functions will be transferred from the FCDAs to metropolitan districts, London Boroughs and the City of London. They will be entitled to enter into agreements with the FCDAs to carry out civil defence functions under draft regulation 6(3). Although FCDAs will receive direct grants, they will have no duties unless requested by the authorities or the Minister of State to arrange training to support boroughs in their areas and co-ordinate exercising and liaison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the emergency services' functions, on which we depend, are provided without being specifically resourced. There is also a burden in terms of pension requirements. In introducing the draft regulations, the Minister must take account of the considerable burdens on those bodies, which are more obvious in the case of the FCDAs, for which the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0580">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
standard spending assessment is effectively the budget. In other authorites, the problem is hidden in the apparent flexibility of an overall budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government grant to local authorities under the Civil Defence Act 1948 in 1992–93 was £26.9 million in England and Wales. The Minister should spell out the resource implications for the future of the responsibilities placed on local authorities by the draft regulations, which he wants to be able to tell the House that we have considered properly. In 1993–94, £26.9 million has been reduced to £20.2 million—a reduction of 25 per cent. in cash terms. Only about half that reduction is because nuclear bunkers are no longer funded. The Government propose to cut funding by another 25 per cent. in 1994–95 and in 1995–96, which will reduce specific emergency planning funding to £15 million in England and Wales. I understand that the counties' calculation is a reduction of 37 per cent. in central funding in county council areas over the next two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When county councils and FCDAs receive income from emergency planning activities, such as charging site operators under the Control of Industrial Major Accident Hazards Regulations 1984, the Home Office deducts an equivalent amount from their grant allocation. In other words, that money cannot be counted as additional. That should be noted. If the situation continues as the Government plan, they will have reduced funding for emergency planning by 43 per cent. in cash terms, or nearly 50 per cent. in real terms since the general election. Cuts of such magnitude will severely handicap local authority emergency planning and possibly result in up to 300 of the 800 jobs in emergency planning being abolished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The crux of the matter is the provision of resources to undertake the responsibilities in the statutory instrument. The proposal contrasts strongly with the recommendations of the Government's special adviser. Perhaps the Minister will consider the following extract from 	<i>Hansard.</i> The then Home Secretary, in a written answer, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In his report Mr. Brook, the civil emergencies adviser, points to a number of shortcomings in local authority arrangements for dealing with peacetime disasters. Some local authorities are effective in their planning; others less so. Mr. Brook has identified particular problems of inadequate planning and co-ordination in some metropolitan areas. He has recommended to me that there should be new legislation on civil protection which would include a statutory duty on local authorities to plan, train and exercise for their role in mitigating the effects of peacetime disasters…</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>It is clearly unacceptable that some local authorities should be inadequately prepared to deal with a major peacetime emergency and I agree with Mr. Brook that the shortcomings…must be rectified."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 10th July 1991; Vol. 194, 	<i>c. 394–5.</i>]</p></blockquote>
Two years later, the Minister introduces a statutory instrument and states that although the Home Secretary in 1991 recognised the need for fresh legislation, the Minister is not prepared, or not able, to give us a time scale within which that should take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be reasonable for these statutory instruments to be a stop-gap until legislation is introduced in the Queen's Speech in the autumn, when only a minuscule debate would be required, but the Minister has not assured us that the Home Secretary's remarks in July 1991 will be followed through. There seems to be only one possible interpretation of his remarks, which is that he was intending early primary legislation. It is deeply worrying that two years later the Minister says, when introducing this statutory instrument,
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
that the Government have no such intention. The Minister must account to the Committee if primary legislation will not be introduced for a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The danger is that the Government see an opportunity for penny-pinching rather than dealing with the important issue of public safety. The savings are insignificant in terms of national finance, but extremely significant for safety. Local authorities are unable to reallocate resources to deal with what may happen in the future. The statutory instrument contains a reference to a duty to plan for emergencies and to carry out exercises based on such plans. That is welcome because a plan that exists only on paper is of little use to anyone. The Minister must tell us his intentions, because the last paragraph of the statutory instrument places an onerous requirement on local authorities virtually to do anything that the Minister tells them to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the many Ministers who are involved in this fragmented pattern of responsibilities, it would be helpful if the Minister were clear about whether the responsibility lies with the Home Secretary or a Home Office Minister, or whether it goes wider than that. Often, when legislation goes through the House of Commons and right hon. and hon. Members try to establish who will be responsible, they are told that the reference to a Minister or a Secretary of State means the most appropriate Minister or Secretary of State—in othe words, anyone at any time. If that is to be the interpretation under these regulations, it almost means that any Minister—apart from someone in the Foreign Office—could give a local authority instructions. A Minister's words when introducing legislation need to be precise, for the sake of implementation. Therefore, will the Minister clarify the Government's intentions on the use of that element of the statutory instrument?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The anxiety is that the changes introduced by this statutory instrument arise not from a proper reassessment of the country's emergency planning requirements or from a shift in emphasis to peacetime from wartime disasters but from an arbitrary response to the need to clarify responsibilities. We fear that Ministers are responding to pressures from the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new emphasis on integrated emergency management means that local authorities will be encouraged to develop broadly based plans which will enable them to respond to all kinds of emergencies. That is welcome, but it is not enough to guarantee adequate planning, training and exercise for civil emergencies, especially as it is accompanied by a decrease in central Government civil defence funding and support for infrastructure, in addition to the financial changes that I mentioned earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will answer a number of questions when he responds to this short debate. Will he clarify what civil defence purposes comprise? The 12 detailed planning areas in the Civil Defence (General Local Authority Functions) Regulations 1983 will be repealed. It seems that nothing of substance will be put on the statute book to replace them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is the duty of a council to consult such other bodies or organisations as it considers appropriate about its plans omitted from draft regulation 4(2)? That omission was originally a feature of the draft regulations issued in December 1992. In due course, another Statutory Instrument Committee will deal with the revised Scottish Office draft. That draft, issued in March 1993, rectified the matter. But the original draft has been reinstated here. It
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0581">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
goes without saying that consultation on the contents of emergency plans is vital. Yet the Home Office seems to create the absurdity that councils are legally obliged to consult each other but not the other organisations, especially the police and the fire service, involved in disaster response. Such consultation is necessary and must be recognised for funding purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The crucial element is whether the Government regard the present arrangements as completing a coherent system of emergency peacetime planning. Given the makeshift arrangements for peacetime emergency preparation, the Government do not seem to have succeeded. Will the Minister tell us—especially if he perseveres in saying that there will not be early primary legislation—what plans the Government have to put the function on a proper basis?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, I mentioned the remarks of the specially appointed civil emergencies adviser, Mr Brook. In the report commissioned by the Government, he recommended that there should be new legislation. Why have the Government not acted on that advice? The Civil Protection in Peacetime Act 1986 allows local authorities to use civil defence resources for emergencies not connected with war.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some crucial questions must be answered at the end of this debate. Will the Minister of State give undertakings to this Committee on what will happen following the agreement of the House to the statutory instrument? Will he recognise the need for legislation and a proper framework and start the consultation process now? Will he do so in order that such consultation can be completed in time for primary legislation in next year's Session? Will he recognise the burden that the Government are imposing on local authorities, and the curtailed time scale? Will he consider this matter and act to help local authorities to ensure that proper provision is made in every area of the country for emergency plans, in which every community can have complete confidence?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Above all, will the Minister acknowledge the need to plan ahead and to give local authorities a framework to ensure that they can do what I have no doubt they want to do—protect the public in their areas and anticipate all sorts of emergencies?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As our society becomes more complicated and more technologically advanced, the nature of the problems and emergencies that arise place even greater strain on emergency services which, in any event, are under great strain, month by month and week by week, in exercising their ordinary, everyday functions. The Minister should reply to those questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of the day, the question of resources hangs over us. In another context, the Prime Minister has been fond in recent months of saying, "He who pays the piper calls the tune." Today, the Minister's aim is to call the tune. We need to know whether the piper will be given adequate resources to do the job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to draw the Committee's attention to the observations made by my hon. Friend the Minister, who referred to the Home Secretary's statement of 12 November 1991. The basis on which the regulations have been drafted is the supposed continuing reduction in the threat of attack to the United Kingdom, following the end of the cold war.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
That presumption is far from proven and, if proved fallacious, could have catastrophic consequences for our civilian population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not need to be especially perspicacious to realise that we still live in a nuclear world, both civil and military. The Gulf war showed that even relatively small regional powers can pose a threat to the civil population of their neighbours. We should bear in mind the terror that the threat of Scud attack posed to the populations of Israel, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has also been nuclear proliferation, because the Soviet Union has broken up and, instead of one centre taking nuclear decisions, there could be multiple centres of nuclear decision taking. We know that nuclear weapons are stationed in Russia, Kazakhstan, Byelorussia and the Ukraine. With proliferation extending to Libya, Israel, Pakistan and India, the world is becoming a place where nuclear weapons are much more widely dispersed. That trend is likely to continue and not only involves the threat of nuclear attack as a conscious act of Government policy, but the threat of what might be termed nuclear blackmail or terrorism. Nuclear technology is at risk of being exported from republics that were part of the former Soviet Union. That technology could fall into the wrong hands and pose a threat to the civil population. We realise from the Chernobyl episode that nuclear power generation is not always totally safe. Western technology may be infinitely superior to that of the east, which has been exported by the former Soviet Union and elsewhere. Nevertheless, because of terrorism, and natural accidents such as earthquakes there is a risk of fallout and radiation affecting civil populations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other tragedies, which were exemplified today when a Tornado hit a helicopter over the Lake District. It was not so long ago that the Lockerbie and the E1 A1 747 cargo jet disasters occurred. Such events could be replicated on a more awesome scale by the collision of two jumbos over London. It would be unwise for the Government not to make statutory dispositions of a primary legislative nature for civil emergencies and relief, as well as for the hazards to civil populaitons that are consequent on war.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trend seems to be going in the opposite direction, which is rather strange. Usually, countries that weaken their military defences make corresponding enhancements to the amount of civil protection for their people. Neutral countries in our continent—Sweden and Switzerland—which have not enjoyed our mutual military security by virtue of membership of alliances, have relied on well prepared civil protection and emergency planning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to the cuts in our military preparedness, which in this unstable and uncertain world make deterrence inherently less effective, the Royal Observer Corps has been disbanded. That organisation provided radiation monitoring, which is important to the protection of civil populations not only in times of war but in times of peace if there were a nuclear accident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is proposed that there should be no further approvals for the construction of local authority emergency centres. The 1983 civil defence regulations rightly required local authorities to establish equipment and maintain protected emergency centres from which to co-ordinate their activities in the event of a hostile attack.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0582">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
The new regulations revoke the requirement for emergency centres at a time when many local authorities have just completed their construction, although the proposed regulations allow the centres to be maintained voluntarily. If local authorities chose to close their emergency centres, it would not be possible to rebuild or re-equip them easily in response to the threat of hostilities. That would require local authorities to have foresight, but they will not be privy to the dangers of sudden attack any more than Government are, with all the apparatus of intelligence and Foreign and Commonwealth Office warning at their disposal. This deficiency causes me some concern. One must recognise that emergency centres have been used by local authorities for co-ordinating their response to peacetime disasters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals will place the statutory responsibility for civil defence in the metropolitan areas with the borough council. I represent a London constituency; in London the responsibility will he with the boroughs and the City of London. I suspect that there will be a great disparity of civil defence provision in the different boroughs. I voted against Third Reading of the Bill to abolish the Greater London council because I believed that to do so, without having put in place a new slimmed-down, rationalised London-wide authority would be to leave a gap and a deficiency in the governance of London. This is manifestly the case in matters such as emergency planning and civil defence. The Government are optimistic in assuming that there will be uniformly high standards throughout all the 32 London boroughs and the City of provision for civil defence. We know that that will not be the position, but there will be no statutory mechanism by which the Home Office can ensure that deficiencies of individual London boroughs are made good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The capital is one part of our kingdom that is particularly at risk, especially from terrorist attack, as we saw only too recently, with two horrendous bombings in the City. My hon. Friend the Minister may disabuse me if I am subject to any misapprehension, but I believe that the Government have concluded that, in future, national arrangements for warning the public will be based on the use of television and radio broadcasts, Indeed, the Home Secretary's statement on 12 November told us that the continued maintenance of our obsolescent national siren warning system could no longer be justified and that the system would be closed as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not all walk around with our Walkmans plugged in, waiting to listen to the latest radio broadcast, nor do we spend all our time sitting in front of the "box", but if there were a sudden Scud attack, for example, it would be essential for the civil population to be able to take cover within minutes. People will be at risk if we do not have another system of effective warning. The same can be said of civil nuclear emergencies. I understand that regional government headquarters are likely to be disposed of. If the worst happened and there was an attack on the United Kingdom—after all, the international situation changes surprisingly rapidly, as we have seen in our political lives, from bad to good to bad because international affairs are cyclical—it would be important for administration to be maintained through regional government headquarters. I would like the Government to recognise that fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
I have long admired the work of the National Council for Civil Protection. A previous president of the council, the rt. hon. Lord Renton, a distinguished colleague of mine in my early years in the House of Commons has brought to my attention several issues that I ask the Minister to deal with in summing up. They highlight potential inadequacies in the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, we need a clearly defined statutory responsibility for emergency preparedness to be placed on local authorities. The regulations might be all right as a temporary expedient but as the then Home Secretary said in 1991—not so long ago—his special adviser, Mr. Brook, advised that new legislation on civil protection should include a statutory duty. Instead of wasting almost a parliamentary year on Maastricht, the Government should have made the protection of their own citizens the first of their legislative priorities. Without doing that, an integrated emergency management plan cannot be statutorily underpinned. Without such a plan, uniform and effective local preparedness throughout the country is unlikely to be obtained. That is my first point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point concerns David Brook; I do not know whether he is the same Air Vice-Marshal David Brook whom I used to know—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am informed that he is, in which case he is a fine Cranwell-educated gentleman whose advice I would take seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advised by the National Council for Civil Protection that Mr. Brook's successor will not have continued right of access directly to the Home Secretary. If not, why not? That seems extraordinary and, essentially, irresponsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, Ministers have suggested that they expect local authorities to contribute to the cost of the emergency planning services. The revised system for distributing grants from the Government will mean that some authorities will experience a financial reduction of between 40 and 50 per cent. If Ministers expect local authorities to contribute to the cost of emergency planning services in those circumstances, I suspect that they are being over-optimistic. Some authorities may; many will not, especially when my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary is trying to reduce local government expenditure. Given the current financial restraints, I cannot be optimistic that even a basic adequate minimum of local emergency planning for civil defence will be maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have the gravest reservations and deep disquiet about the regulations. I should be much happier if, during this Session, we had done the sensible thing and discussed primary legislation. I note that the Association of Metropolitan Authorities suggests that the reductions in Government funding will severely handicap local authority emergency planning and will possibly result in up to 300 of the 800 jobs in emergency planning being abolished. I want my hon. Friend the Minister to tell me whether that is true. The advice from the Association of County Councils, which has the largest geographic responsibility for civil defence although not necessarily the most critical one—I suspect that that lies with the London boroughs and the City—is that the new regulations are generally acceptable. Therefore, I will go along with that, but I should be much happier in so doing if my hon. Friend the Minister were to do the honourable thing and say that at the earliest possible date—preferably during the next Session—primary legislation on this subject will be introduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.19 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paddy Tipping 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sherwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) made a raft of important points, three of which I shall reinforce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities will be pleased to hear that the Minister is committed to the primary importance of local authorities and that he will back them and monitor their progress. They want to be consulted and to be involved. Part of their difficulty is that the matters that we are discussing tend to be fragmented, disorganised and confused. My hon. Friend spoke earlier about the difficulties Of relating to differenct Departments. We must have a more streamlined and efficient system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities will be interested in the Home Office's proposals for issuing new planning assumptions. They will be keen to get an undertaking from the Minister and his Department that there will be consultation about those planning assumptions and that the period for consultation will be meaningful. There should be adequate time for a dialogue between Government and local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second and, perhaps, most important point that has been made is that the draft regulations are, by definition, temporary. There is a clear need for new primary legislation. We live in a changing world in which we hope that change will occur for the better. It is important that new legislation is introduced to provide local authorities, for the first time, with a legislative framework in which to deal with civil defence emergencies. At present they believe that they are piggybacking on wartime regulations. As events in Wales and riverboat accidents have shown, it is important that there are adequate plans for civil defence duties in peacetime. Perhaps the Minister will carefully consider the issue, will talk to colleagues and will argue the case to find time to introduce such proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members have already touched on a third area of anxiety. Given changing circumstances, it is right that the Government should take the opportunity of a peace dividend. However, we should transfer that dividend to civil emergency planning rather than wartime emergency planning. The scale of grant available to local authorities from the Home Office and the scale of the planned cuts in grant are, frankly, alarming. The Goverment may want local authoities to make up some of that shortfall, but those who have a dialogue with local authorities, as most of us have, know the tightness of their budgets, their spending plans and their desires, for example, to maintain education and social services. It is felt strongly that emergency planning tends to be a Cinderella service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed cuts are enormous. The £22 million spent on 100 per cent. grant last year is reduced to £20 million this year, with a proposed further reduction to £15 million in the next financial year. As has been said, the emergency planning officers of the National Council for Civil Protection suggest that of the 800 emergency planning officers, 300 could go. No one would want to countenance that. People aspire to high quality public services that meet local needs. The way to achieve those aspirations is to work in meaningful partnership with local authorities, to introduce new primary legislation as a matter of haste so that the task is clear and well-defined, and to provide the necessary resources. I hope that the Minister will listen to the concerns that are expressed and be prepared to act on them, if not now, in the very near future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
	<p>5.25 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have scribbled many points across five sheets of paper, so I hope that they will not all be lost in the obscurity of my handwriting: I shall do my best and be as brief as I can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth spoke fluently and interestingly, but he made heavy weather of some matters. He wants an Act: a number of people have argued for that and I can see a case for it. But the hon. Gentleman's argument that not having an Act would waste time is extremely wide of the mark. If we made no change and did nothing until we had found time to put legislation on the statute book, there would be a considerable delay, and one far greater than would be justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson) referred to the remarks of the then Home Secretary in 1991. He accepted that there were shortcomings in civil defence arrangements such as their breadth and equality of standards throughout the country. He said also that he wanted to correct those shortcomings as far as possible through existing legislation, which is precisely what we are doing now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth should not dismiss so readily the argument of scarcity of time in the parliamentary timetable. We could not introduce legislation for nearly a year, even if it had priority. It is also unwise to introduce legislation that is not vital as the structure of local authorities may change in the foreseeable future. I am not convinced that an Act will be needed. Most of my hon. Friends and many Opposition Members think that we have a tendency to legislate too much, but whenever a subject in which they have half an interest is being discussed they feel that it is not being taken seriously unless there is an Act. I need convincing that an Act would help to improve matters in a way that could not be achieved either through existing legislation or by guidance, which is how we intend to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we do not intend to legislate in the foreseeable future, if the need arose I would want to put the appropriate legislation on the statute book, but I am far from convinced that that will be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth has less confidence in local authorities than I have. They have a good idea of their responsibilities and of the plans that they might draw up, if they have not done so already, to cover possible local emergencies and disasters. They do not need that set out in detail in a long Act. So varied are the emergencies that might occur, that however long the Act was we would certainly leave out some of them. It is much better to place responsibility on the local authority, where it clearly belongs, because that is where it mut be executed. We should make it clear that it has a statutory base, which in this instance springs from the 1948 Act, and proceed by consultation and guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When, as I hope that it is, the order is accepted by the House of Commons and is operational, we shall be issuing the first tranche of guidance to local authorities. That will be much quicker and effective, and more flexible, than trying to write everything in statutory form. Although I have been dealing with the issue for all of four weeks—hence my great experience of it—I have had sufficient time to talk to my officials, and who told me that local authorities take seriously their responsibilities for these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0584">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
I have more confidence in the expertise and understanding of local authorities than the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth, given his speech. I do not believe, however, that he wished to convey such an impression, but meant instead that the Government, of course being the Government, were not doing the right thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take seriously the remarks of the hon. Member for Sherwood (Mr. Tipping). I shall refer later to his other comments, but consultation is important. It is important to the Government because knowledge and expertise can be shared. As a result, it can be seen whether there is some consistency throughout the country and that good practice is shared. It will be for local authorities to take the initiative, and any pretence that it can be taken by the Government by means of legislation or other approaches is a misunderstanding of the varieties of disasters that can occur. The first reaction must be a local one, and it must make use of existing local resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth wondered whether everything will flow through the Home Secretary or whether other Ministers will be involved. He referred to the complexity and confusion or responsibility within central Government. That is the nature of a Government, given the variety of problems that might arise. If there were a plane crash, the Department of Transport would be involved. No legislation or formula exists that would make the Home Office the repository of all the wisdom that would need to be brought to bear in such circumstances. If there were an outbreak of contagious diseases, the Department of Health would be involved, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If such events take place, talks will take place with the designated Minister. According to the nature of the emergency, the designated minister may change. The advice that would be given and the assistance that might come from central Government would depend on the particular emergency, which would determine the particular Department. But the sponsoring Department—the Department with overall responsibility for coordination—is the Home Office. It must, however, look to the expertise of colleagues in other Departments. In certain instances, another Department would take the lead, because a particular type of emergency would properly belong to it and it would be odd if any other Department assisted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Cardiff, South and Penarth and for Sherwood referred to resources, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip, North wood. I accept that there are never enough resources. Name an issue for which a local authority has responsibility, and it will not have enough cash. Name a programme for which the Government have responsibility, and the resources will not be adequate for their plans. It is also true that we are not placing extra responsibilities on local authorities. They have had a role in planning for emergencies, and are not adding to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have reduced some of the planning responsibilities of local authorities for sustained nuclear war. That will release some resources. What the Government have supplied was never intended to cover the cost of every piece of expenditure that a local authority would have to make in planning for an emergency, and certainly not in dealing with it. We are making a contribution to local authorities' resources for planning purposes. I believe that £15 million
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
will be extremely helpful, especially when there has been a reduction in specific requirements as related to a sustained nuclear attack.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may have been confusion in the mind of the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth, or perhaps I misunderstood his choice of words, but I thought at one point that he was suggesting that dealing with disasters should be funded from the Government grant. As we know only too well, when a disaster strikes an area there is always a funding problem. In some instances, help comes from the Government, usually under the Bellwin formula. There is always discussion about how to pay for such disasters, but inevitably the local authority has substantial extra expense. Dealing with disasters can be expensive, but we are making plans to cover the widest range of possible emergencies, and trying to ensure that people are sufficiently trained to take appropriate action, and that our plans are tested sufficiently to ascertain that they will work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand why local authorities do not think that £15 million is enough. Opposition Members would be failing in their duty if they did not echo that concern, but £15 million is what I can provide. It is a useful sum that will enable a great deal of sensible planning to be done. Local authorities that have kept up to date in such matters will have already made plans, but those that have not done so well will have some burden on them to catch up with the rest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood properly reminded us of the danger of war. With NATO and the Warsaw pact, that may have receded, but the danger of smaller wars and other incidents has not disappeared, and in many ways the world is now a more dangerous place. I accept that, which is why I referred to a sustained nuclear attack in my opening remarks. The balance of danger has shifted, and it is the right time to place more emphasis on the board range of preparation, but we must not forget the hostilities could materialise, although the chance is more remote that it would be a sustained nuclear assault from a large and well-aimed arsenal, such as the Soviet Union, directed towards western Europe in the height of the cold war.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Emergency planning does not cover nuclear accidents, but it would need to deal with a nuclear diaster. Such events happen and it is for local authorities in the first instance to make judgments on the balance of priorities. I said at the start, and I say again to the hon. Member for Sherwood, it will be necessary for the Government to consult local authorities and to check on the plans that they have made. We shall want to be satisfied that the range is broad. The possibilty of a nuclear disaster—indeed, a nuclear bomb exploding—is one of the potential disasters that must be considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his advice to the Home Secretary, Mr. David Brook was quite unequivocal in his recommendation that primary statutory powers should be taken by the Government so that local authorities would be required to plan, train and exercise their role in mitigating the effects of peacetime disasters as well as their role in mitigating the effects of war on civilian populations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that the structure of local government is—as it often is—in flux and that the Banham inquiry will meander on for a considerable time. After due consultation, the inquiry's report might lead to legislation. There will be a interval between enactment of that legislation and the initiation of the new authority, whatever that might be. Is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0585">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
my hon. Friend saying that we shall have to wait many years before the primary legislation recommended by Sir David Brook is put in place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, we have to conclude that the legislation recommended by Air Vice-Marshall David Brook is needed. David Brook wants local authorities to have well drawn up plans, with some consistency between local authorities, and sufficient power for local authorities to be able to put those plans lawfully into effect. The Government judge that the 1948 Act, with these regulations, will provide that basic power and place those duties on local authorities. The detail can be more satisfactorily, efficiently, effectively and quickly filled in by guidance and consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, if the need for legislation becomes pressing because, for example, it is inadequate or insufficient and the detail needs to be set down in statute, I would be keen to see that happen before any changes in local government. However, if that is not pressing, it will be sensible to wait until the necessary changes have occurred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The misapprehension is not that local authorities do not have the power and responsibility: they have always accepted that they have. There has been no removal of authority from local authorities. Indeed, the 1948 Act still stands. The misapprehension is that people will not act unless those actions are set out in an Act of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend was worried that there might be inconsistencies and differing degrees of efficiency and enthusiasm with which responsibility for civil defence will be accepted. He confined that concern to London. He is missing the point that in the past, as now, there was a great difference in the preparedness of local authorities. The new measures will put the onus on local authorities and make it clear that they should place less emphasis on preparing for a nuclear onslaught and more on general responsibilities for every type of emergency. I believe that local authorities have the interest and enthusiasm to fulfill that role as effectively as possible, that is the biggest aid to getting consistency across the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will the hon. Gentleman please address the Chair?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, Mr. Jones. I apologise. I am sure that you will have been trying to follow my points while I had my back turned to you.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations provide that the Secretary of State may request local authorities to prepare or enable plans to be carried out. That request is a polite way of saying that the Minister may insist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of the regulations, my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood will notice that a designated Minister might give directions. In my opening remarks, I said that the Home Secretary does not look forward to showering local authorities with new directions. But the powers are there to be used if what my hon. Friend fears comes about. Judging by the reactions that I have heard about through my officials, I am confident that they will rarely be needed, if at all; but they are there, they have legislative force and they would have no more force if they were written in primary legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend explain what practical mechanism will exist by which the Home Secretary may effectively monitor the performance of local authorities in exercising their responsibilities for civil
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
defence in time of war and for emergency relief in peacetime disaster? Without an effective monitoring system, and without measurable standards of performance, how can any Home Secretary, with the best will in the world, interfere and require changes by designation on the part of local authorities in civil defence planning and emergency provisions if those provisions are inadequate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a much more practical question, because the problem is the same whether we are dealing with primary or secondary legislation. The only course is for representatives of the Home Secretary, officials from his Department, to see the plans that local authorities have drawn up, which they are required to draw up, and to be satisfied that those who would put the plans into effect have been sufficiently trained, and that trials and practices have taken place in so far as that is possible. Hopefully, we shall never know how local authorities' plans work because one prays that there will not be a disaster. However, I believe that only through contact with local authorities, inspection of plans and discussion with the officials responsible for them can we make such judgments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend also asked about warnings on television and radio, which he thought would be inadequate if a Scud missile were suddenly on its way. I agree that they probably would be inadequate if a Scud missile was on its way, but I can also tell him that it would be totally inadequate if a siren went off because no one would know why it had gone off. I believe that, in this day and age, the effective way of warning the population is through television and radio; and some local authorities will find additional ways of issuing warnings in areas of high population, and in offices and so on. In a built-up area, additional means of warning people that would be impossible in country areas may be possible. That is another reason why it is right for local authorities to draw up plans and why it is right that those plans should be inspected by and discussed with the Home Office, which will know what practices exist in other parts of the country and will, therefore, be able to disseminate good practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood asked whether the civil emergency adviser will have access to the Home Secretary. Yes, he will. He also asked about local authorities' contributions—I have answered that question. The hon. Member for Sherwood has departed, but, while he was in committee, I answered the three questions that he raised. However, I have one point to add as a footnote to an answer that I have already given to him and to the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood. It concerns the number of jobs that may be lost as a result of the reduced grant from central Government. I cannot tell how many jobs may be lost, for two reasons. Local authorities now have greater flexibility to decide how to use the grant, and they may or may not use it to maintain staff. They may decide that, in this planning, they can use staff who work part time and, therefore, spread the work over a wider range of expertise. The may decide that there is no alternative other than to make staff redundant, or that all the results that they want can be achieved from fewer staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way the grant has been reduced—starting from last year through this year to next year—has given local authorities time to lay their plans as to how best to deploy staff, to use natural wastage, to transfer staff if necessary and seldom, I hope, to have to declare staff redundant. It is for them to decide. Different local authorities will approach this matter in different ways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are four points that the Minister has failed to answer satisfactorily. First, on the question of resources, he sought to misrepresent in a mischievous way some of my earlier remarks. I hasten to add that at least this particular Minister is never anything worse than mischievous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have great confidence in local authorities but I always believe that if a Minister in this Government says, "I have confidence in local authorities", that should be translated as, "I'm not going to give local authorities the resources to do something." Experience over the past 14 years certainly justifies that translation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to what happens in emergencies. That is a major problem. I did not suggest that we were discussing the costs of a disaster. However, the costs of planning and preparation are often seriously underestimated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having been involved in a planning process several years ago, which involved many papers and meetings, but no preparation and resources, I stress the fact that resources and equipment are needed to prepare for emergencies. Training costs money. It also costs the time of staff who would otherwise be involved in other duties. Those are onerous responsibilities that the local authorities must meet. I am not satisfied that the Minister has adequatley understood that aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point concerns primary legislation. The Minister has not told us what has changed since the Home Secretary accepted the advice of his adviser two years ago to the effect that primary legislation was needed. Local authorities are continually doing work that they are not responsible for, or which they are not required to do by Parliament. That is a strength of the local authority system. The trouble is that, if local authorities are not required to do something, the Government often fail to provide them with adequate resources to do it. Under the present financial restrictions on local authorities, that is a major and general concern. I am not satisfied with the answer that the Minister has given on the need—the need that was recognised by no less a person than the Home Secretary two years ago—for primary legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third aspect concerns ministerial powers. The designated Minister is the Home Secretary. However, as I understand the Minister's answer, the application of paragraph 8 can be undertaken by other responsible Ministers. That paragraph provides:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As respects the exercise of any functions conferred on a local authority by these Regulations, the authority shall comply with any directions given to them by the designated Minister."</p></blockquote>
The Minister has said that the Minister in question might vary according to the nature of the emergency. That is understood. However, with regard to planning, responsibility lies primarily with the Home Secretary. It is important to know whether included in the powers to plan for different emergencies is an ability for a variety of Ministers to exercise the power that is conferred in paragraph 8.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fourth aspect is simplicity of administration. The Minister promised that he would run the regulations with a light hand, and I welcome that. He said also that he would try to reduce the bureaucracy involved, but local authorities are already making some complaint about the
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
tendency of civil servants in his and other Departments to ask for information and to burden local authorities. The Minister specifically pledged to avoid a flood a directions and circulars, and I greatly welcome that. I am sure that local authorities and, I hope, civil servants in the Minister's Department and elsewhere will note that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final request would be that the Minister ensures that costs are kept to a minimum. In 1994–95, each metropolitan authority and each London borough will receive £35,000 in grants and, this year, only £30,000. It may be the Minister's Department or the Treasury that made the decision but apparently, the £30,000 this financial year will be passed on via three cheques. That is a waste of time and money in the Minister's Department; it also involves additional handling costs for local authorities. It does not appear to give the right message, which is surely that this contribution—the Minister acknowledged that it is only a contribution—to the onerous responsibilities of a local authority should be passed on, up front, as soon as possible after 1 April.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Minister's personal expression of intention to ensure that local authorities have as light a burden as possible placed on them, to simplify administration and to avoid the flood of paperwork—circulars, advice and requests for information—which, too often, follows the passing of legislation, whether primary or secondary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once again, I underline the question of the power of Ministers, of other Departments as well as the Minister of State's, under what seems to be an extremely wide final paragraph—paragraph 8—of the regulations. It would be helpful if the Minister could clarify whether Ministers of other Departments could exercise that specific power in relation to the planning and preparation for the types of emergency in which, as the Minister explained, they inevitably have an interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Resources were mentioned. I believe that £15 million is adequate for a good range of planning across all local authorities, although I accept that most local authorities would like more. The £30,000 will not be paid in tranches; it will all be paid to the district councils this autumn, I believe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth was not clear about what primary legislation can do that cannot be done through the regulations and guidance. I assure the hon. Gentleman that, in 1991, the then Home Secretary did not say that he intended to introduce primary legislation. He said, I believe, that the shortcomings should be rectified. After this debate, I shall check the content of his speech, but I believe it to be as I have just said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister has undertaken to check that speech after the debate, and perhaps we must leave the matter there. From my reading of 	<i>Hansard</i> there seems to be no doubt about the matter. However, as the Minister will re-examine the speech, that is perhaps as far as we can take it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we should leave the matter there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministerial powers were mentioned. The designated Minister could be any Secretary of State or the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. It would be much clearer, simpler and more straightforward if as far as possible—I

	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
think that it will be so in almost every case—guidance were issued in the name as one Secretary of State. A directive would be made by the Home Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was trying to convey to the Committee in general, and to the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth in particular, that there is such a range of possible problems and emergencies that other Departments must be involved; often, certainly in planning via the home Office network, it being the sponsoring Department—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
