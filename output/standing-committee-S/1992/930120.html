<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. A. J. Beith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Berwick-upon-Tweed)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the National Savings Bank (Amendment) Regulations 1992 (S.I., 1992, No. 2892).</p></blockquote>
We have been here before and you were present, Mr. Hill, when we debated in the House, during the proceedings on the Finance Bill 1989, rises in minimum deposits for national savings. I said then that
<br><blockquote><p>"If they get away with this proposal, they will probably raise the minimum national savings deposit again and again and shut off many avenues for the smaller savers."—<i>[Official Report,</i> 11 July 1989; Vol. 156, c.835.]</p></blockquote>
I shall return briefly to that theme this morning.<br><br>
Yet again, the Government are raising the minimum deposit to a level which will affect children and pensioners especially. For generations national savings have provided easy banking access for small savers, especially children and pensioners, a means of encouraging the habit of thrift among young people and a valuable service to people in areas where commercial banks are not available. That applies particularly in rural areas where commercial banks are tending to close down branches. The typical small village branch that opened on one or two days a week are closing down and the village sub-post office is becoming the only means of access to financial services for those who do not have transport and cannot easily get to a town. That confirms the value of national savings as a means of saving and handling money for those who have only small sums—for example, pensioners.<br><br>
The transactions involved in national savings are important to rural post offices and sub-post offices. Presumably the Government's objective is to reduce the number of transactions so as to reduce transaction costs. That will reduce the income of those post offices. It is easy to reach the critical minimum income, at which point there are not enough transactions to keep a post office in business. We have seen the trend towards community sub-post offices opening on a limited basis, but even that may not be enough to prevent a serious threat to the one point of access for many Government services and financial transactions, of which national savings form an important part.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
I was brought up to believe that taking money to a post office and saving up for something that one wanted was more sensible than blowing it all on a minor item. The sight of a small child putting his pound or two on the post office counter, which he could hardly reach, is part of our history and folklore and also the means of encouraging habit and thrift in children.<br><br>
Some commercial banks have gone into that market with promotions for children and children's packs. Those banks sometimes have a conflict of policy. On one hand, they encourage children to open accounts; on the other, they raise minimum deposits and thus make it more difficult for children to use the accounts. The role of providing banking services for children is thrown back to national savings.<br><br>
The cost of such transactions may be high in relation to the amount of money being deposited, but with children the cost borne at that stage may be an investment in future business if that young person continues to use national savings as a means of banking after acquiring an income as a young adult and working person. If small transactions by children are turned away, that may block the way to larger transactions being made in later life. It is not possible to cost that merely on a transaction basis and decide that the cost of small transactions is prohibitive. In part, small transactions are an investment in new business by National Savings.<br><br>
We can draw an analogy with premium bonds. The Government announced at the same time in 1989 that they would remove the special facility and increase the minimum deposit for premium bonds. Premium bonds are a fairly bad investment and I would not encourage them, but, if people buy premium bonds, it is more sensible to stick to a small amount. The Government's approach implies that premium bonds are professional gambling, not a mild flutter of a pound or two. The same trend is obvious from the Government's decision that National Savings must cut out small transactions.
What are national savings for? When we previously discussed the increase of minimum deposits in 1989, the Government had a public sector surplus. We were suddenly in an era in which we did not worry about the level of national savings. National savings no longer seemed important to the Government's debt management. How quickly the tables have turned. We now have a massive public sector borrowing requirement and there is a return to national savings as an important part of the Government's funding. We should not have been so hasty in dismissing the role of nationals savings in the Government's debt management and in encouraging habits of thrift and sound financial management.<br><br>
The experience since 1989 should remind us that a generation probably grew up without sufficient guidance and encouragement in sound financial management. Many people became overcommitted. They thought that money would come easily and that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0086">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
borrowing could be easily handled. Habits of thrift learnt early might have been much better.<br><br>
National Savings has a dual role which is undermined. If we increase minimum deposits to an amount that discourages young people in particular from using National Savings and from regularly saving in the small amounts that they are able to set aside, the Government will undermine sound and sensible principles in what to them is simply a cost-cutting exercise. In cutting those costs, they might also be turning away future business for National Savings and thereby imperilling the post office network which is also used for other socially important purposes upon which children and pensioners depend. The Government should reconsider their approach.</span></p>
<p>10.37 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Anthony Nelson)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It might help if I make a few brief remarks to guide and inform the debate. I should like to hear what hon. Members have to say. I thank the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) for introducing the debate. He has done a service to the House and to the public because he raised important issues about public savings and public funding which need to be addressed, on which the Government have difficult decisions to make and on which it is proper to seek the guidance and views of Parliament represented by the Committee.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman reminded us that he was prophetic. He drew a nostalgic image of the savings ethic, with children reaching out with their coins to swell their savings and ordinary accounts. Of course, that is true and it is something that the Government must take into account. But there are alternatives to thrift which offer to many people, including the young, more opportunities for saving.<br><br>
The regulations exercise powers under the National Savings Bank Act 1971 to vary the minimum deposits for the national savings ordinary account and investment account. For the ordinary account, the minimum deposit will increase from £5 to £10 and for the investment account from £5 to £20.<br><br>
Statutory instruments have been laid before the House with a view to introducing the changes on 1 February 1993. I welcome this opportunity to explain why the Government consider the measures to be sensible and necessary.<br><br>
In his autumn statement, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer made it clear that public expenditure must be kept under firm control. Like other Government Departments, National Savings has a part to play in that process. Accordingly, I announced proposals for achieving savings in National Savings running costs, including increases in the minimum deposit for the National Savings ordinary account and the investment account.<br><br>
The main role of National Savings of contributing towards the Government's funding programme has to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
be performed in a cost-effective way. Each deposit into a savings account costs the same to process irrespective of the amount involved, so small transactions are disproportionately expensive. By eliminating very small transactions on those and other National Savings products, we will achieve useful cost savings of £5 million in a full year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alistair Darling <span class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister tells us the cost of processing a transaction?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I can. The marginal cost of processing a deposit transaction is 86p. I shall later explain that that £5 million will not be the saving next year but it will be in a full year. I must point out to the Committee, however, that the cost is in excess of that figure which represents only the marginal cost saving and does not take into account the fixed costs elements, which would significantly raise the cost. The whole cost, however, is still well below the current minimum deposit levels that we are considering reviewing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Great Grimsby)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: What research has been done into the amount of business that will be turned away because of the accounts that will be lost through this measure?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to the amount of business involved for Post Office Counters and the effects that the measure might have.<br><br>
Deposits below the new minimum levels currently account for nearly a quarter of the total cost of handling deposits into the ordinary account and nearly half the total cost for the investment account, but in each case they represent only about 3 per cent. of the total value of deposits in a year.<br><br>
In deciding the new minimum levels for the savings account we took into consideration the average value of a deposit, which is already £49 for the ordinary account and £143 for the investment account, well above the proposed new minimum limits of £10 and £20 respectively.<br><br>
I appreciate that the new minimum deposits could make those accounts less convenient for some customers especially those in rural areas served only nearby by sub-post offices. We hope that more customers will be able to save the minimum deposit, even if they do not have that much available right away.<br><br>
I have received several letters from hon. Members on behalf of sub-postmasters in their constituencies who want to know what effect the measures will have on their business. For many of the smallest sub-post offices in rural areas there should be no direct effect on their remuneration. They are 1,350 outlets on the minimum scale payment. There are 19,000 sub-post offices in total and, as far as the other sub-post offices are concerned, the effect on their remuneration will depend on their differing levels of savings bank transactions, but given that ordinary and investment
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0087">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
account deposits represent less than 3 per cent. of sub-post office business in total, I would not expect the earning capacity of many sub-post offices to be seriously affected.<br><br>
The Government are committed to the maintenance of the sub-post office network, but we must not lose sight of the fact that taxpayers provide the running costs of National Savings, including the fee that they pay to the Post Office, which amounts to £54.9 million in the current year. Some of that fee is passed on to sub-post offices. At present it includes fees for very small deposits which are uneconomic for National Savings to accept. Whatever costs are incurred for the social benefits provided by sub-post offices in outlying areas, I am unable to accept that those costs should be partly borne by what amounts to a covert subsidy.<br><br>
It is important to remember that the cost of running National Savings is a charge to the Exchequer. We must always strive to maintain a balance between the interests of savers and taxpayers. The amount of money saved by the measures represents a necessary and welcome contribution to the control of public expenditure.<br><br>
I did not take this decision lightly. I thought long and hard before doing so, but I am convinced that we are making the right decision.<br><br>
The principle purpose of national savings is to fund the Government's spending requirements. While it is important to maintain and to encourage the savings ethic, we must not lose sight of the cost effectiveness of the principal purpose of national savings.<br><br>
The ordinary account was started in 1861 and the investment account was started in 1966. Both have a popular following. The former has raised about £2 billion, which remains fairly static. In other words, people are not depositing more.<br><br>
The investment account has raised about £9 billion. It has been defunding during this year—the overall balance has been falling. Both accounts must be regarded in the context of the total amount raised by the Department for National Savings—about £44 billion. That in turn must be regarded as the amount that people have lent to the Government for their funding requirements. The fund is not available to repay people.<br><br>
I am conscious of the impact of any changes on the small saver, and I am persuaded that there are more and more alternatives but, most of all, I am sure that my hon. Friends will understand that every Department must play its part in finding necessary and justifiable economies for the public purse. This is a measured and appropriate economy.</span></p>
<p>10.47 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed on three counts. First, to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
give him credit, he predicted that this would happen in 1989. Secondly, his office is rather quicker off the mark than ours in praying against the instrument—hence his appearance in this comer of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Gladstone introduced it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps Gladstone was standing over the right hon. Gentleman when he saw the order being made.<br><br>
Thirdly, I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for his sermon on thrift, which was much appreciated by all members of the Committee.<br><br>
The order is comparatively narrow and involves a comparatively minor issue. I appreciate the Minister's comments on the need to ensure that the cost of collecting national savings is met, and that there comes a point when it is not worth accepting a particularly small deposit.<br><br>
However, the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed made an important point about the culture of saving. That culture is not strong in this country. The Minister and his colleagues might reflect that the Governments during the 1980s probably had greater influence than other organisations in encouraging people to believe that they could spend money that they did not have. Baroness Thatcher used to say that people could not spend what they did not have, but Governments during the 1980s did precisely that and encouraged members of the public to do so, too. That is one of the reasons why this country is plagued with what the technicians call debt overhang and one of the reasons why the economy is not recovering—people are saddled with debt.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman's comment about encouraging people to save was good. Encouraging people to save at an early age is also important. I remember when my grandmother opened my national savings account—I have no idea what happened to it. I came across an old book years ago when I was throwing something out.<br><br>
I did not come to the Committee simply to explain the importance of saving at an early age, but the Minister should reflect on that point. He said that other avenues were open, which is true up to a point. I know that he reads the financial press and keeps up to date on such matters, so he will be aware that not only the National Savings bank, but other banks, building societies and financial institutions are also considering ways of cutting costs. In particular, banks are about to step up the rate at which they close branches and increase charges. Indeed, some would say that they are asking customers to pay for mistakes made by their management in investment decisions during the 1980s.<br><br>
It is wrong to suggest that, if the National Savings bank was to raise the threshold so as to discourage the small saver, he or she could go to a branch of a national or regional bank or building society.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0088">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
Everyone is in the same game of trying to cut costs. The Government, who are not in the same situation as a commercial organisation, must have regard, if not on this occasion, on future occasions, for the effect that that is likely to have on people who wish to deposit small amounts. People should be encouraged to save even small amounts. I realise that £10 is not much in the scheme of things, but the sum total of all the £10s that might be deposited is considerable. As I am sure the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed had in mind, both in 1989 and today, the order asks us to approve an increase from £5 to £10. Next year, who knows; it may be £20, £30 or £50. It is important to attend to such matters.<br><br>
The Government Whip, the hon. Member for Stevenage (Mr. Wood), is shaking his head. I had always understood that, in addition to a Trappist vow of silence, Whips were not even supposed to express an opinion by physical gesture. However, our experience of the Government is that whatever is denied is usually true. Perhaps, when we next discuss the subject, the hon. Gentleman will have been promoted to Minister.<br><br>
Charges are bound to be increased, but the Government must have regard to the fact that, although many people do not have much at their disposal, they might like to save it rather than spend it. That should be encouraged, not discouraged.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman's point about post office branches is equally important. We know that post office branches are under pressure. They, too, are being squeezed by Post Office Counters, as it is now called, and, in many cases, if they lose business it strengthens the argument for closing them. I am sure that all of us are familiar with the circular letter from local post office organisations stating that a particular post office is up for review, that they will listen to our comments and then shut the post office. Time and time again, we are told that less business is being transacted over the counters. We should not maintain any scheme simply to keep someone else in business, but post offices are important, especially in rural areas, small towns and villages, where they are the last organisation that will take money.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Carlisle <span class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling) comment on the fact that the Post Office is now hoping to become an agent for the national lottery on the basis that it is a form of saving, and selling tickets might keep some post offices open? We understand that the Opposition have not decided whether to support or oppose the lottery. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman could give us an indication of whether they will support the lottery, which might keep some smaller post offices open.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not for me to reveal the Opposition's intention, although I understand that next Monday we will have the Second Reading debate on the National Lottery Etc. Bill. If the hon. Member for Luton, North (Mr. Carlisle) looks at the Order
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
Paper at the end of the week, he will see what our position is. I had not understood that the national lottery was a form of saving; I thought that it was a form of gambling. It is no more a form of saving than is going down to the bookie. In my experience, it is a way of throwing away good money after bad. Occasionally, the horse comes in and one is paid back, but the national lottery would not work if everyone won. It can work only if most people lose.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that we had better return to the matter under discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am about to return to it as this brings me neatly to the question of premium bonds. The option of buying cheaper premium bonds for under £100 for children was taken away at the same time and is part and parcel of the same measure. I agree that premium bonds are not a particularly good investment. I have one and it has never come up; if ERNIE—the Electronic Random Number Indicating Equipment—reads our proceedings, I hope that he will bear that in mind. It was purchased in 1969 by an aunt and has never troubled me since. That is not a particularly good investment. However, grandparents especially used to value premium bonds when buying presents for their grandchildren and it is regrettable that the cheaper option has gone. The Government must encourage the culture of saving rather than that of spending.<br><br>
Two points struck me when the Minister was giving the rationale for the order. First, I am glad that his Department is making its contribution to cutting the public sector borrowing requirement, which I understand might be £50 billion this year.<br><br>
The Minister mentioned another aspect that I want to pursue. As most members of the Committee will be aware, the Department for National Savings is earmarked for privatisation. That is called market testing. I wonder why the Minister did not mention that cutting the costs of the Department would make it a far more attractive proposition for a private operator to buy than if it provided a broader social or public policy function. A Government interest or public interest in encouraging savings comes at a price. Private operators would not bother about that.<br><br>
Part of the motivation for the order is that the Department is being put up for market testing, putting at risk about 1,800 jobs. Understandably, the morale in the Department at Durham and Glasgow has been affected badly. It is interesting that the top civil servants who come up with such ideas never put themselves forward for market testing. If they did, they would know what it feels like. Perhaps the Minister plans to do that—we shall see.<br><br>
It is an important matter when we discover that a Department that encourages saving may be farmed out to private enterprise, perhaps to one of the accountancy firms that have made so much money in advising the Government on privatisation. In many cases, they design schemes to suit them or the people
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0089">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
for whom they act so that they can then take over. I regret that the Minister did not take the opportunity to mention that cutting costs, and some of the unpleasant obligations from the point of view of the private sector, is part and parcel of the Government's exercise in trussing up public organisations for privatisation. Many Opposition Members are deeply suspicious of the Government's actions which we believe to be central to the Government's privatisation proposals.<br><br>
Market testing is a euphemism for preparation for privatisation. Everyone wants public service to work efficiently and to ensure that it can learn from the private sector. However, it is quite another matter simply to make a crude attempt at preparation for privatisation. The Minister said that the public sector borrowing requirement looms large in his mind. That is fair enough, but he will want more than the minor savings involved in the order, and dumping a whole Department would work within the Government's policy and to their advantage.<br><br>
It is important to bear in mind that 1,800 staff in Durham and Glasgow are worried about their future and feel that it is unfortunate and unpleasant to have to bid for their jobs. Many know that they will face the dole queues at a time when unemployment is rising and likely to continue to rise for a long time. The order must be considered in that context. I do not quarrel with the desire to achieve efficiency savings or to cut unnecessary cost. However, in relation to encouraging saving and to changing the culture in this country, the order may be a mistake, not because of the increase in savings that it will bring—which will not be major—but because of the train that has been set running. The Committee must also bear in mind that the Government usually concern themselves with cost cutting before privatisation. That is of concern not only to employees but to the country.<br><br>
I hope that my hon. Friends and the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed will oppose the measure.</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Bowden <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brighton, Kemptown)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt that my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury considered the order carefully before presenting it to the House. He has not fully convinced me of his argument.<br><br>
I largely agree with the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed, particularly about pensioners. Many of the older generation never had bank accounts. They are afraid of banks and do not want to go anywhere near them. Given the behaviour of some banks in recent years, one cannot blame them. But the post office has invariably been a friendly place, where such people can meet other pensioners, have a friendly chat with the lady or gentleman at the counter and perform easy and quick transactions. National savings were intended as an encouragement to that section of the community that was not willing
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
to use the bigger financial institutions. Anything that is done to discourage or minimise that effect is not a good thing.<br><br>
I am talking in particular about the group of pensioners now in their 70s and 80s who have seen enormous changes in the world and find it increasingly difficult to adjust to them. All of us find, when we reach our 60s—as I have, unfortunately—that it is difficult to adjust to rapid change. I know, for example, that the offices of some of my younger parliamentary colleagues are like mini-computer rooms. My wife thinks that I am in the quill pen age because I still dictate to secretaries. I do not like computers, I will not use them and I have nothing to do with them. Pensioners find it difficult to adjust to the speed of change.<br><br>
I should like my hon. Friend to consider carefully another aspect of the subject, which has not yet been mentioned. I am certain that his advisers at the Treasury gave him splendid financial accounting advice, which indeed is their job, but I wonder whether he has looked at some of the wider implications, such as crime. You may ask, Mr. Hill, what on earth crime has to do with the order, and I shall tell you immediately before you rule me out. The order may well encourage many pensioners to keep more money in their homes than they should. It will mean that they will have to gather that little extra together before they can deposit it. We know that much crime is opportunist, petty crime. If it is known that a few pounds are likely to be in somebody's house, it is much more likely that that place will be targeted. Anything that we can do to minimise the amount of money that people keep at home must be good. I fear that the order may well have the opposite effect.<br><br>
I shall briefly speak about the savings habit. I am sure that my hon. friend the Minister would agree that is immensely important to start that habit as young as possible. I still believe that one of the most effective ways to do that is by regular family visits to the post office—sometimes with grandad and grandma—to open, or put money into, an account for the youngsters, who will see it grow, albeit slowly. If we discourage that, which may well be the order's effect, the Treasury could, in the medium term, lose more than it is now gaining. The measure could well turn out to be a false economy.<br><br>
I will find it difficult to support the Government today, so will my hon. Friend the Minister undertake to monitor carefully the effect of the order? If he finds that some of the fears expressed by hon. Members from both sides of the Committee are realised, will he review the position and reconsider the steps that have been taken and, certainly, ensure that there will be no further increases in the amounts that have to be deposited at any one time?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was charmed when I entered the Committee Room because at first I thought that I had, by accident, wandered into a Methodist

conference. It is a pleasure to be under the leadership of my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling). It is also a pleasure to learn that the economics of John Wesley live on in the Liberal party. I must say to the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed that pitching those economics to this Government is similar to assuming the role of a preacher in a whore house. The current ethic has nothing to do with the savings ethic that the right hon. Gentleman so eloquently expressed. It is much more the mentality of Vivian Nicholson, which was spend, spend, spend. That has been supplemented by the argument used in the 1980s—borrow, borrow, borrow to spend, spend, spend. Do not bother to save: that is old-fashioned. Nobody needs savings any more.<br><br>
I deplore the proposals in the order and the associated change in the minimum holding of premium bonds. That was put up to 100 quid, which is a monstrously high level and well calculated to turn away business. It frustrates the intentions that Harold Macmillan had when, as Chancellor of the Exchequer and before he became Prime Minister, he introduced premium bonds in 1956. In the 1950s and 1960s all British Prime Ministers had to be called Harold because General de Gaulle was so deaf that he had to refer to them with a constant name when they made their grovelling supplications to enter the Common Market. Because the country became committed to joining the Common Market, all Prime Ministers had to be called Harold.<br><br>
The minimum limit of £100 for premium bonds was introduced in 1989. To raise the limit for children is another retrograde step. The Minister offered no convincing arguments for the change. I emphasise that this change has effectively been introduced without notice. It was announced on 13 November 1992, and it will become effective from 1 February 1993. Post Office Counters, which will face many of the consequences of the order, was not even consulted or informed before the announcement.<br><br>
When Post Office Counters business headquarters was approached, it said that it too was unaware of the proposed changes to minimum deposits for savings accounts and premium bonds and that it would make representations to the Department. Like the plea of the hon. Member for Brighton, Kemptown (Mr. Bowden) for the order to be monitored after it has come into effect, such representations would be a somewhat futile occupation. The Government take decisions in an arbitrary fashion, without consultation. Why was there no consultation with the main agency responsible for the sale of premium bonds?<br><br>
The Minister's speech did not convince me that adequate research into the consequences of the order had been undertaken. He said that deposits below the minimum level account for a quarter of the costs, but only 3 per cent. of the total value of deposits. The crude figures are not that important compared to the habit of saving. Access to that type of saving, with a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
small deposit, reaches out into the community and encourages the habit. That has been the aim of most Governments—certainly sensible Governments—since Gladstone set up the initial scheme.<br><br>
It was the existence of the Post Office Savings bank, into which my grandparents deposited the magnificent sum of £10, that first encouraged the young Mitchell into the habit of saving. That has brought me to my present disastrous financial state. I was a big financial figure in the 1950s. I added the money that accrued from my meat round to the £10 so that when I left for New Zealand to seek fame and fortune, I had £50 in that account, although I came back with my tail between my legs in the 1960s. When I left, I took all but £1 out of the account. The account book is lost. I ask the Minister, where is my £1. What steps will he take to check up on it? Is my account going to be closed? What interest is owed to me?<br><br>
Although it was made facetiously, my point is that people such as children and pensioners having the ability to open and operate small accounts encourages the savings ethic, which is something that Governments should encourage. The crude figures given to us by the Minister do not take into account the social and psychological importance of such savings, which is far greater than the 3 per cent. of the value of deposits that the Minister told us they comprise.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central made a telling and powerful point when he argue that the changes were being made to make the savings institution a more attractive target for a business takeover. If all the trouble, paperwork and small accounts were cut out, a transfer to a private operator would be easier. I hope that the Minister will disavow that. It looks suspiciously likely that a decision to increase the minimum deposit has been made with the correlation between such an increase and any possible evaluation in mind.<br><br>
There has been market testing which, as my hon. Friend said, has had a damaging effect on the morale of the service's staff, producing industrial action in Newcastle and Durham. Testing has been carried out without an assurance on whether the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 would apply. The only undertaking we have from Ministers was given in a written answer to a parliamentary question. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury elaborated on his holding answer of 9 December 1992 and stated that whether the regulations apply would be
<br><blockquote><p>"determined in the light of the individual circumstances surrounding each of the services to be market tested. The Treasury is currently considering, in consultation with the Treasury Solicitor's Department, those services in its 1992–93 market testing programmes to which TUPE will apply."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 11 December 1992; Vol. 215, c. <i>820.</i>]</p></blockquote>
A monstrous degree of indecision and uncertainty is hanging over the people whose fate has to be determined. My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central is right. The regulations and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0091">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
market testing are concomitant. As that is so clear, the Minister should tell us whether they will apply to the staff involved.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central and the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed asked why make the changes now, when the Government are borrowing massively and the public sector borrowing requirement is escalating expotentially? At the present rate, I estimate that in the year ahead it will be more than £40 billion. It probably needs to be, to revive an economy which has been so badly battered by the injudicious and insane flirtation with the exchange rate mechanism.<br><br>
I am glad that the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed has not come in here with his ritual chant of, "Independent central bank now—move to the narrower bands." Perhaps even he has realised that the ERM has had a damaging effect on the economy, and that massive borrowing is required. So why are we axing the roots of the national savings movement which plays a part in raising money? It might be only a small part, but we should shift the nexus of attitudes towards borrowing and spending back to the traditional concern for saving. We should encourage saving, not the boom-and-bust, borrow-and-spend mentality of the 1980s.<br><br>
It is a shame to see the Minister introducing the measure. On totally undesirable measures such as this, Cabinet members have to make the agonised choice of who should defend the indefensible. They choose someone who is so stupid that he does not know what he is doing or so ambitious that he is prepared to sacrifice any principle. But they know that it will be all right because the civil service, whose job is to supply first-rate minds to provide second-rate arguments for third-rate policies, will supply whoever is chosen with a defense of an unjustifiable and indefensible measure. I do not apply that statement to the Minister, for whom I have considerable respect. It is a shame that he is involved in an operation which will be so damaging to the social attitudes and concerns which all right hon. and hon. Members should be anxious to nurture.</span></p>
<p>11.17 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan Milburn <span class='memberconstituency'>(Darlington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: You will be pleased to hear, Mr. Hill, that I shall be brief, as many of the points that I wished to make have already been covered by members of the Committee. I shall not go over ground that has been covered, except to say that the popularity of the ordinary and investment accounts was clearly shown in the Minister's figures. In a quarter of investment accounts and half of all ordinary accounts, deposits fell under the proposed minimum level. To raise the minimum level of transactions to £10 will obviously impact on those depositors. The hon. Member for Kemptown spoke well about the possible impact of the change on pensioners. I share his concern that pensioners may stack away their savings or, more importantly, carry on them larger amounts to deposit in post offices.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
As for the other end of the age spectrum, has the Department any figures about the number of children who take advantage of these savings accounts? I am especially interested in how many children take advantage of the current minimum deposit and how many will be affected? I am sure that members of the Committee will agree that it seems, from anecdotal evidence, that children are major beneficiaries of the current provisions, which enable them to take regular trips to post offices to deposit relatively small amounts in their savings accounts. They may receive gifts of money from grandparents or from other relatives or friends, or they may regularly save small sums, perhaps from their pocket money.<br><br>
Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have spoken of instilling the need for a savings culture in people of all ages. That is especially important among children. We want young people to understand that saving is important and that spend, spend, spend is not the only route to economic prosperity or happiness. The current national savings minimum deposits facilitate precisely that savings culture. Perhaps the Minister would respond to that specific point. Taken together with the discriminatory and arbitrary way in which the minimum premium bond level has been increased from £10 to £100 for children, I believe that the proposals will deter many children from embarking on a lifetime of savings.<br><br>
It is argued that the increase in the minimum deposit will reduce administration costs—the Minister gave figures. I have done a little research into the issue. The details of the cost structure of the Department for National Savings are given in the Treasury's annual departmental report. The average transaction costs for the ordinary and investment accounts are among the lowest administrative costs of any account operated by the savings department. They are less than half of the yearly transaction costs of the yearly plan; they are one-sixth of the transaction costs of a savings certificate plan and one-eighteenth of the transaction costs of the capital bond scheme. Yet despite the cost-effectiveness of the policy and the relatively low administrative costs, the Minister, the Government and the Department want substantially to change the deposit levels. Frankly, I do not understand why, unless there is an ulterior motive. I very much agree with my hon. Friends that the ulterior motive relates to preparing the savings department for privatisation.<br><br>
Some of my constituents work in the savings department in Durham City which, as the Minister knows, employs several hundred people. Already, there is much consternation among the staff there. I am sure that they will view this proposal, together with the proposal to market test, as a clear sign that they are on the road to privatisation. They are not a militant work force, as the Minister knows, yet Government policy has already managed to foment industrial disputes in Glasgow and Durham City. That is quite unheard of. When my constituents and the hundreds of other staff who work in the Durham City savings department find that, once again, they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0092">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
are being forced towards privatisation, they will inevitably react adversely.<br><br>
The proposal before us today must be seen in that context. It is remiss of the Minister not to tackle that point. When he summarises this debate, I hope that he will actively consider the anxieties that have been expressed and that he will come clean about the future of the saving department both in Durham City and in Glasgow.</span></p>
<p>11.23 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have received such support and useful information from the hon. Members for Edinburgh, Central, for Kemptown, for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) and for Darlington (Mr. Milburn). The hon. Member for Kemptown perhaps summed up the fears of many of us about pensioners. I can only recount my recent experience of talking to pensioners in my constituency, in a housing area where systematic robbery of pensioners holding small sums at home had taken place. The pattern is well known. Two people looking like workmen come to the door. One says, for example, "Could you change me 50p for the 'phone?" and the pensioner will go to the sideboard drawer containing the little tin of money. The other person might say, "I am not feeling very well. Could I have a glass of water?". One of them engages the pensioner in conversation and the other collects the rest of the money while the pensioner is looking the other way. That is a danger for pensioners holding small sums of money at home. If a person cannot deposit £6 or £7 in the local sub-post office where the pension is collected, he or she does not have the means to increase safety.<br><br>
Pensioners who do not keep money at home are threatened by the fact that it is known that more people are doing so. Thus the threat of crime and of intrusion into pensioners' households becomes more widespread.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Great Grimsby conjured up a lovely picture of saving up from his meat round to pay for his passage to New Zealand. I wonder how he paid for his passage back. Whether the New Zealand authorities contributed is a secret that we shall, I suppose, never know. However, I remind the hon. Gentleman that in creating a savings culture—I agree that it is very important—the independence of the central bank is far from irrelevant. It relates to combating and getting rid of inflation—the other great enemy of any kind of savings culture. The more a society suffers from endemic inflation the less worthwhile it is to save, and the more worthwhile it is to borrow. Quelling inflation is a crucial part of the maintenance of a savings culture.<br><br>
Hon. Members expressed general concern, which was not allayed by the Minister's remarks. He might have seemed to go some way towards allaying anxiety with his figures about Post Office Counters and the potential effect on small post offices. However, there is of course no guarantee that Post Office Counters, after an overall loss of business, even at the margin, of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
1 per cent. or 2 per cent., will not change the arrangements for its minimum-scale post offices—those about which, as the Minister pointed out, we might be most concerned. As areas of business drain away or are squeezed, Post Office Counters will begin to examine the ways in which a minimum level of income is provided for the smallest sub-post offices.<br><br>
The Minister must know from experience that pressures are being exerted by Departments. The Department of Social Security tries constantly to persuade pensioners to have their pensions paid direct into a bank account and not over the post office counter. The regular staple income of the small sub-post office is threatened from all directions, to the detriment of those who continue to depend on such post offices for financial transactions. The Minister's genuine attempt to deal with hon. Member's concern about that matter does not deal with the problem. Wider concerns about the effects on pensioners and children remain. Support for that view has been such that we should register it by a Division at the close of proceedings.</span></p>
<p>11.27 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jim Dowd <span class='memberconstituency'>(Lewisham, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to you, Mr. Hill, and to the Committee for absenting myself from part of the proceedings, for business that could not wait.<br><br>
I shall not repeat my hon. Friends' arguments. They were compelling, and I shall not bore the Committee with repetition. I shall ask the Minister to answer a few questions. They are, I am afraid, all about numbers, but, as numbers are the substance of our discussion, it is important that I understand them.<br><br>
I listened carefully to the figures that the Minister gave us. They were illuminating, but they also produced some confusion. The Minister spoke of the 3 per cent. of the total value of transactions that would be affected by the measure. My hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby spoke of 3 per cent. of the total value, which is £9 billion. I am not sure whether the same figure is being discussed. Is the transaction figure the same as the total value of the savings? If not, what is the cash figure represented by the relevant 3 percent?<br><br>
Has the Minister's Department carried out any assessments of the number of people who are likely to be affected by the loss of such transactions from National Savings and of where they are likely—if they can—to put those savings?<br><br>
I shall not concern myself with the homily on the values of saving, which would ring very hollow in many parts of the country. The very notion implies a surplus on one's revenue account, to speak technically, but I shall not digress so far.<br><br>
Yesterday, I received a letter from the Minister, for which I am grateful, in response to a matter which was raised by a constituent—the £100 minimum for premium bonds. The reply, which is relevant to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0093">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
broader issue that some of my hon. Friends stressed earlier, contained the question, which I quote from memory as I do not have it with me, why children should invest in premium bonds when that is such a tax-inefficient way of using their resources, because it bears no interest. I am sure that the Minister will not name the culprit—it may even have come from his own pen—but that was a case par excellence of someone who, to use the Wildean epigram,
<br><blockquote><p>"knows the price of everything and the value of nothing."</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friends have demonstrated that there are deep-seated social aspects to the mere financial calculations made here, which will be placed under strain, if not direct threat, if the measure goes through unchallenged.</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to all hon. Members who have contributed to the debate. I had expected many of the points that were raised and I had considered them carefully before making my decision. Therefore, I make no complaint about the questions that I have been asked or about the particularly important point that my hon. Friend the Member for Kempton made regarding the impact on crime and behaviour in the community and society more generally.<br><br>
I shall deal with the points in order. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central spoke about the effect on people with small savings. There are, have been and will continue to be people who want a safe haven for small amounts of money. We hope that the proposed changes, which are marginal in increasing the minimum deposit, will not deter or prevent that. The increase is not substantial and it is much less than the average amount deposited already in those accounts—£43 and £149 respectively.<br><br>
I was asked about the alternatives. In the past, National Savings was almost the only option for many people with small savings in villages and towns, but many more options are available now. I shall not bore the Committee with a long list of those options, but they include the four main banks, Abbey National plc, Girobank, the Co-operative Bank plc and the TSB Bank plc, all of which offer interest-bearing instant access accounts on deposits of £1. More than a dozen smaller banks offer the same facility.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How long will that last?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister will not reply to remarks made from a sedentary position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my reply will be comprehensive enough to cover all the points that were raised. Four of the larger building societies, plus 20 smaller societies, also offer instant-access accounts for a minimum deposit of £1. The raison d'être of many such organisations is to provide a savings institution. They do not have the purpose, which the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
Department of National Savings does, of raising funding for the Government. Therefore, they have great interest in promoting the loyalty and affiliation of small first-time savers. I do not underestimate the importance of that, or the substantial amounts already tied up in those accounts. My point is that in recent years there has been a growing number of alternatives for small depositors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seems to be getting into difficulty. I should have thought that the Government have an interest in encouraging savings with them, rather than with other institutions. Indeed, they are overburdening the gilt market at the moment because they need to encourage people to put money into Government bonds and to save with the Government rather than with private institutions.<br><br>
The Halifax building society is clearing out deposits of £10 or less. I know that for a fact because I received a rude letter from my local branch drawing attention to an account that I had forgotten about and threatening me with massive charges unless I took action. I did, and I took my business elsewhere. The Minister will find that many institutions are not interested in the small saver, which is why the Government must take a broader view. Will people who have accounts of £10 or less in nationals savings be threatened with charges unless they take their money elsewhere?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, that is not proposed. Although the services vary from building society to building society, many of those institutions offer such accounts. The Bradford and Bingley, the National and Provincial, the Nationwide, the Yorkshire and 20 other small building societies all offer instant accounts with a minimum deposit of £1. Alternatives exist.<br><br>
The issue of premium bond purchases was raised by a number of hon. Members. That is not covered by the order, but it is relevant because it impacts on overall policy on national savings. It is right that we have to meet a substantial funding requirement, but it is not right to expect investment ordinary accounts or premium bonds to make a massive contribution to that. They could do so only at the expense of deposits and savings accounts elsewhere. They do not have the buoyancy and increasing yields that we see in other products, such as first-option bonds, which have been major net contributors to national savings in the past year.<br><br>
On premium bond purchases for children, the minimum purchase was raised from £10 to £100, bringing it into line with the minimum for adult purchases. Premium bonds with a value of less than £100 bought on behalf of children account for almost a fifth of the cost of handling purchases, but contribute to as little as 1 per cent. of the value. When the minimum premium bond purchase for adults was increased from £10 to £100 in 1989, the savings in costs achieved were sufficient to enable the Government to allow a special exemption for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0094">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
purchases by parents and grandparents on behalf of children under 16.<br><br>
The need for further cost savings means that we can no longer justify accepting such small purchases, each of which costs £2 to process. That may be disappointing for some people who have been accustomed to giving their children or grandchildren premium bonds as presents. However, a number of other savings gifts are available for less than £100, including the children bonus bonds. They will help to teach children the benefit of saving as they see the growth in value rather than relying on the uncertain chance of winning a prize.<br><br>
I hope that hon. Members agree that for new small savers it is more prudent to encourage them to build up a saving that is a store of wealth than it is to encourage them to buy a premium bond.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Minister about the general principle. However, would it not have been an alternative to offer grandparents buying premium bonds for children the option of meeting some of the costs he described by introducing a transaction charge? I do not advocate that for savings accounts, but I might for premium bonds. If grandparents chose to buy £10 or £15 worth of premium bonds and there was a charge of £1, £1.50 or even £2, they could decide whether to take that option. Other forms of gift vouchers incur a charge.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That idea does not appeal to me. It would be complicated and costly to administer. I am not sure that the receipts would tally with the considerable costs involved in buying premium bonds. If one buys £10 worth of premium bonds, it does not make sense for that transaction to cost £2 and to offer that as a charge to someone.<br><br>
I understand the fears about market testing and privatisation. The proposals have nothing to do with market testing. They are concerned with cost saving and I overtly justify them in that regard. Of course, market testing has something to do with cost saving— and rightly so—in order to obtain value for money in public services on behalf of taxpayers. However, the proposal for minimum deposits is not related to market testing.<br><br>
We are seeking savings in the Department of National Savings of £1 million in a full year. That may, of course, have implications for staffing. We hope that redundancies will be kept to a minimum and effected, as far as possible, through natural wastage and retirement. That will ensure that there will be savings within the Department of National Savings as well as savings on the agency fee.<br><br>
I defend market testing, which has delivered enormous savings to the benefit of our constituents as the money would otherwise have to be raised in taxes and borrowings. Although I understand that the process of market testing visits some uncertainty on may people providing important public services, in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
the private sector it is an everyday discipline with which people have to live. It is right and proper to have a criterion and a benchmark against which to judge a service's value and costing.<br><br>
Market testing does not necessarily mean contracting out. It does, however, mean that there is a comparision—a tender. If the process determines that work can be done in the private sector to the benefit of the taxpayer, that is what happens.<br><br>
It is important to understand that the Department for National Savings is not like a bank, with an asset side that can be privatised. The money put into national savings is spent on all the public services that we have to provide. If we sold it, we would be selling a lot of debt contracts, and I do not think that there would be many buyers. It could perhaps be managed in the private sector as an agency. I do not find that appealing—people feel secure about depositing their funds in the Department for National Savings because the Government stand behind it. If it were privatised, it would be no different from many other savings institutions and the Government might contract to raise money for it, in any case. I do not find those arguments particularly appealing, although I know that Opposition Members were not seeking to put them. The proposals have nothing to do with any such ideas.<br><br>
I am conscious of the important work that staff at Durham, Glasgow and elsewhere do for national savings. The administration behind the scenes of managing those and other accounts and products is considerable. Although people generally—and right hon. and hon. Members occasionally—are right to draw shortcomings to the attention of Ministers and the Department for National Savings, the staff deserve a bit of credit for the many things that they get right, their devotion to duty, and the considerable accuracy and diligence that they exercise in providing the public service of looking after many people's savings.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Kemptown called post offices friendly places. Inded they are. A post office is more than a shop—it is a community service. That is especially true of sub-post offices. I believe that post offices will continue to be friendly places after these changes are made. My hon. Friend will agree that the Department of Social Security activities hallmark post offices and sub-post offices as friendly places. People go to them to collect their pensions and social security payments, and that will continue to happen.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Kemptown has always demonstrated great concern about pensioners, and he speaks often on their behalf in the House. Those over 55 account for 22 per cent. of holders of ordinary and investment accounts. They represent a considerable proportion of depositors. The majority of holders of both accounts are adults, a considerable number of whom are elderly.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
My hon. Friend mentioned crime, a consideration that we take seriously. Equally, people are vulnerable going to and from post offices with case in hand, especially elderly people who are alone. That may be one of the reasons that over the years, people have been encouraged to have their pensions paid direct into accounts. However, for understandable reasons such as convenience, many people still prefer to collect their pension in cash. Of course, a number of elderly people collect their entitlement to social security payments or pensions and then pay it straight into an investment or ordinary account to avoid the risk of community crime.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Kemptown is right that that is a problem, but I do not believe that, by raising the minimum deposit from £5 to £10, we shall substantially increase the number of pensioners at risk at home who have notes in a jam jar to save for that moment when they can put £10, as opposed to £5, into an account. There is some risk of a little more liquidity among pensioners in the community. However, I believe, and I invite the Committee to accept, that the measure will substantially and materially affect the incidence of crime against pensioners.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be flippant, but will the Minister explain the meaning of "community crime"? Is it a new Government expression?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not at all. I was simply trying to maintain the theme of the small community in which people go to and from their local sub-post office to deposit their savings or to collect their pensions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cirencester and Tewkesbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to prolong our proceedings but I should like to make a point to my hon. Friend the Minister. The regulations were introduced in 1972. If inflation since then is taken into account—I do not have the RPI figures before me—the real level of deposit is less than in 1972.<br><br>
I happily support the regulations, although I do not argue that they should be index-linked as I have many rural sub-post masters and constituents who will not welcome the regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. He is right that inflation accounts in part for the increase. Nevertheless, I acknowledge that, at this time, it is quite a real-terms increase.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Kemptown asked whether I should carefully monitor the change. I undertake that I shall most certainly do so. It is not the intention to increase the minimum deposits above this level. Of course, I cannot speak for all time. There will be considerable savings to the public purse. The change is justified and necessary. However, I shall carefully monitor the change, for all the reasons outlined by my hon. Friend, and because it is important to maintain and promote the savings ethic within the Department for National Savings.<br><br>

I was sorry to hear about the £1 account of the hon. Member for Great Grimsby. He asked where it is, what has happened to it and whether I would immediately look into the matter. The hon. Gentleman is not alone. I was astounded to learn that there are 40 million accounts worth less than £1. The total value of those accounts is less than £10 million. Many accounts are moribund; they are not used; people have forgotten about them, and they have fallen into disuse. As the hon. Gentleman asked the question, I thought that I should give him the answer.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman said that there was inadequate notice about the change and suggested that it was somehow deliberate, but that is not so. I decided that the change will come into effect on 1 February and not on 1 January. We could have done it sooner. The reason for that—especially in relation to premium bonds—was that I knew that many people would receive gifts at Christmas which they might want to pay in in the new year. There could have been a further cost saving by bringing forward the change. The announcement was made at the time of the autumn statement, and there was a press release. There has been a considerable and quite expensive process of notifying the Post Office and users, through the national press. Inevitably, many people will wake up to the change only next month when it is in practice in post offices. However, I firmly reject accusations of inadequate notice in terms either of time or of substance.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn) asked how many children hold such accounts and how many will be affected. There are 400,000 children with ordinary accounts; 2.4 million children under 16 have investment accounts, and they represent 6.5 per cent. and 49 per cent. respectively of the account holders.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman suggested that the ulterior motive for the change is privatisation. I hope that I have demonstrated that that is not so, and I have firmly rejected that suggestion.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed said that the stability of post office income was threatened by the changes. The hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Dowd) asked for clarification about the 3 per cent. figure. The amounts involved are a small proportion in terms of the attributed agency fee of the total turnover of the post offices. The total turnover of Post Office Counters Ltd. is about £1 billion. The 19,000 sub-post offices have, in addition, the quite separate footfall business. People go into a stop for a post office service, but they may also buy bread, milk and other goods. The figure of 3 per cent. is 3 per cent. of the value of total receipts, represented by deposits of less than £10 million in ordinary accounts and of less than £20 million in investment accounts.<br><br>
The Department for National Savings agency fee to Post Office Counters Ltd. this year is £54.9 million, which is the amount that the DNS is paying to all post

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
offices for providing those services. Within that, the saving will amount to £4 million, which will apply to the 19,000 sub-post offices as well as to main post offices. We estimate that less than 3 per cent. of the business of sub-post offices is represented by ordinary and investment accounts.<br><br>
I hope that I have demonstrated that the proposed changes are justified as valuable savings for the Exchequer and, therefore, for the taxpayer, that they will not change the public's savings ethic, that they will not diminish materially the income of sub-post offices and that, in the context of a substantial borrowing requirement next year, they form an important part of the need to keep a tight rein on the public purse. For those reasons and particularly in view of the assurances that I have given to my hon. Friend the Member for Kemptown, I hope that the Committee will support the order.</span></p>
