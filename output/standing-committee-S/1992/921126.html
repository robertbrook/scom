Draft Private Streets (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 1992</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. Jeremy Hanely)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Draft Private Streets (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 1992.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bob Dunn <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dartford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask for clarification, Mrs Winterton? I have a machine with wheels on my left and a machine on my right, and one of them is lit up. Can I be assured that it will not go off in the middle of the Minr's speech?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that no one seeks to blow him up, but if he would like those two pieces of equipment to be moved, I shall arrange for that to be done immediately. However, if the hon. Gentleman can bear to endure the length of the Committee with a companion on his left and one on his right, we shall continue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The draft order amends the Private Streets (Northern Ireland) Order 1980, which is the legislative base dealing with all aspects of private streets matters in Northern Ireland. In general terms it is designed to deal with minor deficiencies which have emerged from the operation of the 1980 order and reflects the need to make more economical use of resources. To this end it contains provisions to amend the powers and duties of the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland, as road authority, and the responsibilities of developers in certain matters relating to the planning, construction and subsequent adoption of private streets. The amendments will bring Northern Ireland legislation broadly into line with corresponding legislation in Great Britain.<br><br>
The effect of the draft order will be to introduce changes in five distinct areas. First, Northern Ireland is at present the only part of the United Kingdom where the cost of lighting in private streets is met by the road authority. Article 3 effectively places responsibility for the provision of street lighting in new developments upon developers or, in the case of existing streets which are to be adopted, upon the owners of adjoining land.<br><br>
Secondly, under existing planning legislation the Department's current policy provides that where new developments cannot be accommodated except by improvement of the existing public road—for example, the provision of a footway or road widening—developers may be required to carry out the necessary improvement works. The provisions in article 4 do not represent a departure from this practice.<br><br>
Thirdly, under article 5 the Department will be empowered to stop up or temporarily close any street which has been constructed before or in contravention of planning permission.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
Fourthly, in recent years there has been some pressure from the private housing sector, particularly at the more expensive end of the market, to permit completed streets to remain private rather than become public roads. Article 7 will enable the Department, on request, to permit certain streets in new developments to remain private, while continuing to ensure that such streets are built to a proper standard.<br><br>
Finally, under articles 6, 8 and 9 the procedures for dealing with expenses are modified and extended to include the costs of inspecting street works and the registration of various statutory charges. These changes basically reflect the general principle of recovering expenses from the responsible party and follow the widely accepted "consumer pays" philosophy.<br><br>
The proposal for this draft order was circulated for comment to a wide variety of interested parties including all the district councils in Northern Ireland and relevant representative bodies, and comments received were duly considered in drafting the order. Therefore, I commend the order to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>10.33 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien <span class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank you, Mrs. Winterton, for assuming the hon. Member for Dartford (Mr. Dunn) that his protection and his concerns are your concern. I am sure that applies to all of us here and we appreciate that immensely.<br><br>
As the Minister said, the order is intended to improve street lighting, to make provision for making up private streets and public roads and to give the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland the power to close any street or road at some person's or persons' expense if it wishes to use the road for improvement purposes. The improvement and the provision of additional street lighting can benefit only the people and the communities in those areas. Therefore any improvement that offers that sort of service is welcome.<br><br>
I am sure that my hon. Friends will agree that good street lighting for any village, hamlet or community helps to bring security and generally improves the quality of life of the people in those areas. My first experience of local government in the early 1950s was of being elected to an urban district council in an area where the streets were lit by gas. I campaigned for electric street lighting to improve the area and, indeed, it did so. I have always believed that street lighting is essential for the improvement of communtiy life.<br><br>
Article 3 of the Order refers to "proper" street lighting and the definition of that is just for lighting streets. There should be more to it. I am trying to secure from the Minister that included in the principle of the order should be the provision of good-quality modern street lighting for Northern Ireland.<br><br>
I attended a seminar here yesterday in the Jubilee Room on the subject of street lighting. It was a well received and provided good information. One point that emerged was that the seminar organisers reflected on a league of street lighting improvements in Cardiff, Glasgow, Manchester, London, Leeds and Hull, but nowhere in the document was there any reference to Northern Ireland. If we are to have league tables—and the Government are keen on league tables—is the Minister prepared to include street lighting for Northern Ireland in any league with the other
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0658">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
authorities in England, Wales and Scotland so that comparisons can be made with the quality of lighting in other parts of the United Kingdom?<br><br>
Will the Minister also agree that the all-party parliamentary lighting group or the Audit Commission could monitor, say, Belfast, Lisburn, Newcastle or any other town in Northern Ireland and compare that with other areas of the United Kingdom? We are talking here of street lighting and the way in which it will apply to certain communities in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
Will the Minister comment on the fact that the authority responsible for street lighting in Northern Ireland is the Department of the Environment? In the other towns to which I referred, local government is responsible. In my opinion there is need for some comparison to assure the people of Northen Ireland that they are getting value for money and that the principle which applies in other parts of the United Kingdom applies to Northern Ireland in this order.<br><br>
Communities will be better off with better roads. If private streets are to be made up into public roads, the public will clearly be better off. Travelling on unmade roads is a shocking experience; in the dry period the problem is one of dust and other issues of pollution; in the winter it is sludge and water. Therefore no one will oppose the principles in the order of making up private streets into public roads.<br><br>
However, there is the issue of quality. As we are being told that where local services are provided quality should be the password, I ask the Minister to give assurance that there will be comparisons between the quality of street works in Northern Ireland and those in other parts of the United Kingdom. Is there a waiting list for streets to be made up in Northern Ireland? If so, could he let me have a copy showing the streets that still need to be made up to the standard of public roads, including the need for street lighting?<br><br>
If there is such a list, how is the Department of the Environment trying to reduce it? How are the various streets placed in order? There are a number of questions to be answered from the point of view of value for money and the way in which the orders apply to Northern Ireland. I am sure that the Minister will say that the district councils are consulted on such matters. I accept that there may be consultation, but the final decision is left with the Department of the Environment. Therefore, which street is made up, the quality of that street, where the street lamps are placed and the density of the street lamps are all the responsibility of the Department of the Environment.<br><br>
There is also the question of accountability, which I raised in a previous discussion with the Minister. It would be helpful if he would tell us the level of accountability. I am sure that the district councils will be consulted, but that will be the end of their responsibility. The responsibility will be with the Minister himself, and it would therefore be of interest if he could dwell a little on the question of responsibility and accountability to the people of Northern Ireland.<br><br>
I have a final question for the Minister. In article (4E) reference is made to the fact that to secure due performance of any agreement involving the making up of a private street or the positioning of street lamps, that agreement shall be sealed and guaranteed by a bond
<br><blockquote><p>"or any other means acceptable to the Department".</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
The idea of a bond is to ensure that if work is commenced in providing street lamps or making a up a road, and then for some reason the contractor cannot continue and complete the work, the work will be completed. What does the Department mean by "any other means acceptable" other than a bond? This is important and significant, and requires an explanation for the people of Northern Ireland</span></p>
<p>10.43 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifford Forsythe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Antrim, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I make my usual heartfelt protest about the method by which Northern Ireland business is handled in the House, namely, by Order in Council.<br><br>
For the benefit of those members of the Committee who are not fully aware of what it means, this order cannot be changed even by a full stop or comma. It cannot be amended. It can be either withdrawn or voted against and defeated, and that is very unlikely, considering that the Government have put it forward. I put officially on record yet again my protest about the Order in Council. We cannot consider it line by line—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I remind the hon. Member gently that the points that he raises are not relevant to the draft order. The subject matter to be discussed is the narrow terms of the order. The Committee would be grateful if the hon. Member would return to them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsythe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps a little later, Mrs. Winterton, you will see the relevance of my comments. Even with the support of all Opposition members of the Committee, the order cannot be defeated.<br><br>
Your remarks, Mrs. Winterton, may have made a point for me. I should like to draw the Committee's attention to article 4(4) of the order, which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"In Article 42(2) of the Roads (Northern Ireland) Order 1980 after sub-paragraph <i>(e)</i> there shall be added "or</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p><i>(f)</i> it is work done for the purpose of complying with a requirement attached under Article 3(4A) of the Private Streets (Northern Ireland) Order 1980 to a determination under Article 3(1) of that Order.".</p></blockquote>
I find article 4(4) in another document, the Private Streets (Northern Ireland) Order 1992. In that document is the draft Roads (Northern Ireland) Order 1992. Before the Committee passes article 4(4) of this order, it is already dealing with the matter in another draft order. That covers what I was saying earlier: the nonsense of governing Northern Ireland by this method has been clearly illustrated by what I have just said.<br><br>
I wish that the Northern Ireland Office, in bringing forward these orders, would try to make sure that what is being brought forward by order, which cannot be amended or changed, is at least done in a way that is acceptable to the Committee and to the House.<br><br>
I have to say to the Minister that the Order is seen as a slap in the face for the hard-pressed construction industry in Northern Ireland, especially when many firms are struggling to maintain their staff. They are not even worrying about making a profit, but are just trying to keep going.<br><br>
I was interested to hear what the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien), the Opposition spokesman, said about street lighting. Although I am in favour of good street lighting, I must point out that street lighting in Northern Ireland is run entirely and exclusively by the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland. I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0659">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
would find it unacceptable if the Department of the Environment were to force upon the construction industry standards that they themselves are not carrying out. Standards laid down under the order should be acceptable in the light of what the Department of the Environment already does.<br><br>
It has been acknowledged that in Great Britain the practice has been for some time that street lighting is provided by house builders. Even with the present slump in house prices in Great Britain, however, developers are well able to keep to our list percentage, which is an indirect cost. They can observe that percentage quite easily.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to distract the hon. Gentleman from his train of thought, but I make the point that, while it is true that in new works the street lighting is provided by contractors, in many instances in other parts of the United Kingdom local government provides it, particularly in villages and in towns where they consider that decent street lighting should be done at public expense. I suggest to the Minister, therefore, that that is what the DOE should be considering also in Northern Ireland, not just leaving it to the contractors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifford Forsythe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, and I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. In Northern Ireland the order will add between £500 and £700 to the cost of a single house being built. According to the university of Ulster's 1992 analysis of the propoerty market in Northern Ireland, the average house price is £36,376 for a semi-detached and £45,955 for a detached dwelling. It's obvious that the end of the market is much more price-sensitive to £500, or £700, than the highest market would be in Great Britain. We have to look at the total cost of passing on capital costs, not just of street lighting; road improvements, building control fees, water and electricity connection will force the sale of new dwellings way beyond the reach of most potential home owners.<br><br>
In a part of the United Kingdom with particularly high unemployment, unfortunately there would be a further fall in the already weak level of demand for housing. Such changes in some areas might mean that development would be completely uneconomic to carry out. That will force many people on to the Housing Executive's waiting lists, which are increasing all the time. It will also seriously affect employment in the industry, which at present employs over 35,000 people and it will have an adverse effect on the ancillary industries which supply those who fit street lighting in housing estates.<br><br>
As it is on record that the Government wish to help the construction industry, would not it have been possible for the order to have at least been deferred until the whole economy recovers and there is a better chance of the construction industry taking on these extra charges. After all, the Department of the Environment praised the building industry in Northern Ireland as one of the successes in 1980.<br><br>
The determination of housing layouts is already a lengthy process and subject to many delays in Northern Ireland. What provision will be made to ensure that the determination of lighting layouts will not be delayed? I hope that the process will not be delayed unnecessarily. Who will be responsible for repairing street lighting that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
has been vandalised in the time between the lights being fitted by the industry and the street being taken over by the Department of the Environment?<br><br>
I want now to refer to what the hon. Member for Normanton said in relation to article 4 and existing streets. Many streets are not made up at present and the Department of the Environment has no intention of making them up, even though one might say that it had a moral obligation to do so. Perhaps the Minister could keep that in mind.<br><br>
As I said earlier, the Department states that the policy of developers making a contribution to the cost of road improvements reflects current practice in Great Britain, and that is true. But the policy in Great Britain has been in place since 1971 and has had 21 years to evolve. That has given builders and purchasers time to adjust to the effect on house prices. In addition, daily circulars and practice notes have given guidance in Great Britain over that time on the application of the policy contained in the order. Therefore the industry in Great Britain has been well aware of the policy for 21 years and could negotiate with the local authorities on how it applied. But unfortunately that is not the case in Northern Ireland. To check this, I consulted the Northern Ireland Construction Employers Federation, particularly concerning a Department of the Environment roads service letter, which stated that article 4 of the draft order
<br><blockquote><p>"does not represent a departure from the current situation whereby developers may be required to carry out certain (road) improvements".</p></blockquote>
The presumption in that letter is that there was consensus between the Department of the Environment and the federation, but I have to tell the Committee that there was no such consensus. Federation sources have led me to believe that the whole complex issue of infrastructure contributions popped out of the woodwork in early 1991 as a result of the design briefs issued after the publication of the Belfast urban area plan, at the end of 1990. In federation and Department of the Environment consultations since 1986 no indication was given of any radical changes of the sort contained in the order. Only after the design briefs were published in 1991 was there the first indication of a new policy initiative, without consultation or any advance notification, and certainly without legislative authority.<br><br>
The order gives statutory backing to the policy, which was introduced only in 1991 under article 40 of the. Planning (Northern Ireland) Order 1991, which leads me, unfortunately, to the conclusion that the Department appears to be introducing legislation to back up its now administrative decisions, taken without statutory backing.<br><br>
Before this, the Department imposed negative planning conditions on planning approval which developers, through economic and commercial necessity, had to comply with by entering into voluntary arrangements with the Department. The industry was not given any advanced notice of the imposition of such costs or any opportunity to negotiate with the Department until the policy had been put in place. The matter has been badly handled and if it was possible, I would ask for the Adjournment of the Committee while the inconsistencies were sorted out. In the circumstances, I can only listen to the Minister's reply and ask a few questions.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0660">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
A negative planning condition is subject to right of appeal. What right of appeal is there against a determination of road improvements covered by article 4? How much money will be saved by the imposition of such provisions in Northern Ireland? If money is saved, will it be retained in Northern Ireland by the Department of the Environment, or will it be returned to the Treasury?<br><br>
In an annex on article 4, a letter from the Minister says:
<br><blockquote><p>"No additional burden will be placed on developers."</p></blockquote>
Given what I have just said about the Planning (Northern Ireland) Order 1991, and the facts that there was no consultation and that this was not being raised with developers until after the briefs were published by the Department in 1991, will the Minister tell us exactly what
<br><blockquote><p>"no additional burden will be placed on developers" means?</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the two hon. Members who have spoken, the hon. Member for Normanton and the hon. Member for Antrim, South (Mr. Forsythe). In presenting this order today, I am speaking on behalf of the Minister of State, my hon. Friend the Member for South Ribble (Mr. Atkins) who is the Minister responsible for the Department of Environment in Northern Ireland and who has unfortunately been called away this morinig to other business, which he is, as usual, carrying out assiduously. I shall draw to his attention the <i>Official Report</i> of our proceedings and I am sure that he will join me in giving credit for the dedication of Members present, including you, Mrs Winterton. I know that all those here today have a deep interest in the affairs of Northern Ireland.<br><br>
I shall deal briefly with some of the comments. The hon. Member for Normanton raised a number of important and relevant questions about the quality of street lighting, and we echo his views. I shall ask my hon. Friend the Minister to consider whether there are any general points that he should put in a letter to the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
The bond he mentioned is the normal one that a bank or an insurance company would be able to issue. An alternative, which would of course be acceptable to the Department, would be cash. I hope that that will help to answer the question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does "any means acceptable" mean that the only other means would be a deposit of a bond in cash? Is there any other inference?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a perfectly normal requirement. A bond, which shows that there are funds sufficient for the purpose, can be issued by a bank, by an insurance company, or by any other similar body that would guarantee that funds were available in the eventuality that the hon. Gentleman mentioned unfortunately came to pass. I merely say that cash would be most acceptable. Indeed, we should be grateful for it. One hopes, of course, that the bonds will not be used. We hope that the development will be successful and beneficial to all concerned.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Antrim, South is well known for his great interest in the quality of housing, roads, lighting and public services in Northen Ireland in general and in his constituency in particular. He spoke at the beginning about the parly procedure with these matters. May I assure him and other hon. Members that I have been working hard for the past six months trying to pass responsibilities for the matter back to the elected representatives of Northern Ireland, and I shall continue to do so? I regret that we have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
the procedure, but we must make the best of it, in the meantime. We sent the draft order to all 26 district councils, and 46 other representations went out to other statutory public and professional contacts. The party leaders received the draft order and it was published in three Northern Ireland daily papers. We received a wide range of responses and considered them carefully.<br><br>
In reply to the questions asked by the hon. Member for Antrim, South, Northern Ireland is the only part of the United Kingdom where lighting on private streets is provided by the local authority. I believe such provision to be an integral part of any development and consider that Northern Ireland should be brought into line with Great Britain. Experience on the mainland has shown that developers readily accept the responsibility as the costs involved represent a very small proportion of overall development costs and can lead to greater flexibility of design. That is very much to the benefit of those who buy the properties, and it can help to attract a sale of the properties.<br><br>
I understand the hon. Gentleman's point that margins are likely to be smaller in developments in Northern Ireland because of the lower house prices, but lighting is only a small part of the cost. We estimate that less than 1 per cent. of total development costs would be involved in the order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsythe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would it not have been useful and more satisfactory if a longer period had elapsed between the suggestion being made and the bringing in of the order? It would also have been helpful to the industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no optimum time. I quite understand why the industry would have liked this order not to have been brought in at all. In effect, it is only the reorganisation of current practice into statutory form, so I feel that the industry can probably bear it. I hope that, through it, they may make their developments even more attractive to those who I hope will then buy them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsythe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Minister's stance. I do not wish to be awkward, but it is not standard practice in Northern Ireland, for street lighting to be done by the construction industry. I do not wish to prolong the Committee, but that is not the situation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is important to appreciate that the article to which the hon. Member for Antrim, South referred does not introduce any additional burden on developers. He was talking about article (4):
<br><blockquote><p>"Works for the improvement of a public road joined by a private street".</p></blockquote>
The Department's policy under existing planning legislation provides that, where new development cannot be accommodated except by the improvement of the existing public roads, developers may be required to carry out the necessary improvements. The provisions of that article do not represent departure from this practice. Rather, they will provide an alternative statutory mechanism, which shoud result in more streamlined administrative procedures for dealing with such situations.<br><br>
As to the hon. Gentleman's two questions: yes, appeal will be to the planning appeals commission, and any moneys saved as a result of the order will be retained and used in the roads division. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that it will not be sent back to the greedy hands of the Treasury. The money will be used for the benefit of all

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
people in Northern Ireland, not merely those who are either developers or are occupying the houses that have been so built.<br><br>
I commend the order to the Committee. I assure the hon. Gentlemen concerned that the Minister of State will study the record and reply on any issues that I have not covered.</span></p>
<p>11.10 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister made an interesting comment in response to the hon. Member for Antrim, South—that for the past six months he has been trying to encourage local people to accept some of the responsibilities in their Province. Will the Minister explain in what way, relative to the order, he wishes to have a local interest—either through the district councils or other local bodies or individuals—that would take some responsibility for such matters as street lighting, making up or stopping of public roads? I should be interested to learn how the Minister has attempted to push some of the responsibilities included in the order back on to the local communities, or people in communities, in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
I appreciate that the Minister is to pass on some of my points, such as that about the outstanding street works on record in Northern Ireland and how these will feature in the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
order of preference and about street lighting. As the Minister, through his reponsibilities in Northern Ireland, is familiar with performance indicators, will he comment on the fact that there should be performance indicators to ensure that both new and existing street lighting is of good quality?<br><br>
The Secretaries of State for Health and for the Environment say that the best way that can be done is to have comparisons. Is the Minister prepared to comment on that, and to agree to the principle that the performance indicators should apply to the facilities provided by the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland, on a similar footing to the advice of local government in the rest of the United Kingdom?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have nothing to add to what I said earlier.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Private Streets (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 1992.</p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Committee rose at thirteen minutes past Eleven o'clock.</i></p>
