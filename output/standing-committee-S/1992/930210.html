	<p>[SIR JAMES KILFEDDER 	<i>in the Chair]</i></p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='legislation'>Social Security Benefits (Amendments Consequential Upon the Introduction of Community Care) Regulations 1992</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Bradley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Manchester, Withington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James, I want to raise a procedural matter. Regulation 3 concerns preserved rights of individuals in residential care. Under Section 43 of the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990, there is confusion about the way individuals with preserved rights will be dealt with if those rights are undermined, for example, if the home in which they are living goes out of business. That section makes it clear that the local authority that would be responsible for those residents would not have the power directly to take over those preserved rights and the financing arrangements for individuals. New regulations were promised to explain how the local authorities would deal with categories of people who, under regulation 3, have preserved rights. However, it is not clear which groups local authorities will be able to support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To consider the statutory instrument, which interacts with section 43 of the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990, when draft regulations under that section have not been laid is an abuse of parliamentary scrutiny because the Committee cannot fully appreciate the consequences of what is being asked to approve. I request that we do not proceed this morning until those regulations have been laid and it is clear how people with preserved rights will be dealt with, if those rights are undermined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James, I support the claim that we should carefully consider whether to proceed with the regulations. I understand the issue of preserved rights—it has been drawn to my attention and I am concerned about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand how the Committee can sensibly consider the regulations without also examining the top-up provisions and the arrangements for that. Regulations will have to be laid in future to deal with that matter. It would be much better for the process of parliamentary scrutiny if the Minister were to present us with a series of coherent regulations—they all overlap.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the hon. Members for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Bradley) and for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood). I shall consider their comments but, in the meantime, we should proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i></p>
	<p>That the Committee has considered the Social Security Benefits (Amendments Consequential Upon the Introduction of Community Care) Regulations 1992 (S.I. 1992, No. 3147).—	<i>[Mr. Burt.]</i></p>
	<p>10.34 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the fact that you will consider my comments, Sir James although I am disappointed that we are proceeding with the regulations. There is a large gap in terms of the amount of money that is being discussed for preserved rights and in terms of proper parliamentary scrutiny of legislation; there is a clear relationship between the Department of Social Security, which is responsible for individuals in residential care, and the Department of Health, which, through the local authorities, will ensure their future well-being. We must be certain that people's well-being will be assured, otherwise the way in which the statutory instrument has been presented this morning is an abuse of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Alistair Burt)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his courtesy in expressing his concern to me last night. The Department of Health intends to introduce regulations that will deal with those matters. I do not believe that they impinge on our proceedings today. We are scrutinising the social security regulations. The scrutiny that the hon. Gentleman requires, which relates to the Department of Health's further proceedings in this matter will be subject to the normal process of scrutiny in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation, but I think that it reinforces my point that he recognises that regulations from the Department of Health impinge on the people whom we are discussing. As regulation 3 is entitled "Preserved rights" and the Minister has made it clear that those rights flow through to the new regulations under the 1990 Act and are removed from the responsibilities of the Department of Social Security, we are dealing with only half the issue. The consequence for many elderly people in residential care is that they will be uncertain about how they will be dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hoped that, this morning, we would have been able to get precise information about how the regulations will affect those people. That hope has been undermined by the Government's failure to lay the regulations through the Department of Health such regulations should interact with the social security regulations and be consequential on them. To debate properly what preserved rights entail, we have to ensure that those rights genuinely flow through to the new regime after 1 April. I doubt that that will happen. We must ensure that the public are clear on that matter. I hope that we shall have another opportunity to raise our anxieties on the Floor of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Preserved rights have caused concern in the past and are a cause for concern now among many who work in the residential and independent sector. That issue will cause great anxiety when the provisions of the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 come into force on 1 April.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0101">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Regulation 3 deals with preserved rights that relate to people who are in residential care and who claim income support. In addition, the preserved rights flow through for people who, because of their income or capital, are not currently paid income support. They retain rights to income support in the future if their situation changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That all sounds very grand and as if everything in the world is rosy and clear, but we are discussing not those kinds of preserved rights but preserved rights to inadequate benefits and uncertainty because of the growing gap in, the cost of residential care and the amount of income that people receive through the income support system. Over the years, that amount has increased, but the gap has widened. There is a massive amount of evidence to support that contention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that all members of the Committee have received as many letters as I have from independent homes expressing anxieties. Those letters explain that many existing residents and their relatives experience hardship because income support does not meet the full cost of their care. Homes in the private and voluntary sector are running up debts and going out of business because of the shortfall between benefits and fees. Many residents have had to turn to charities to find top-up money so that they are not evicted from homes. A vast amount of evidence from the charities shows that they cannot continue to make that money available to so many residents. The charity commissioners have questioned the role of some of those organisations. They do not believe that topping up the difference between the fees and the income support levels introduced by the Government is an appropriate use of charity money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many surveys have shown the extent of the shortfall. A survey for the Association of Charity Officers by the Institute of Gerontology showed that, in 1990–91, 117 charities were providing £4.8 million in top-ups to 6,772 elderly people. The average weekly grant was £20.58. Topping up payments absorbed 38 per cent, of the charities' expenditure on elderly people. The average weekly shortfall in the summer of 1991 for elderly people outside London was £57.61 for those in private residential care, £50 for those in voluntary sector residential care, £55.26 for those in private nursing homes and £56 for those in voluntary sector nursing homes. That is one example of the extent of the problem, which occurs because preserved rights are linked to an income that is too inadequate to ensure that those people have the right to remain in their residential home. Preserved rights preserve the right to help with the shortfall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is impossible to judge the effects of regulation 3 because that will depend on how it interacts with regulations yet to be made under section 43 of the National Health Service and Community Care ACT 1990. That section prevents local authorities from paying part or all of the fees for residents who are in homes on 31 March 1993. It is not clear what role the local authorities will play in ensuring that the cost of the gap is met and that the people who have preserved rights will be secure after 1 April 1993.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Regulation 3 provides only the right to some income support without guaranteeing that the fees will be covered. What thought has been given to the position of residents? I want to consider some specific groups. There are residents who manage to meet the fees because relatives or friends make up the shortfall. Who will be responsible, under the preserved rights, for filling the gap if those relatives or friends die or run out of money?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If fees rise and income support does not increase sufficiently, a gap will occur which will disadvantage the residents whose fees have increased above the income support ceiling. That is particularly applicable to residents in terminal care because income support limits for those people are being frozen from April. The cost of terminal care will rise and the amount of income, because the terminal care support has been frozen, will be reduced and a gap will open. Those people might be insecure because the fees may not be met and cannot be topped up by the local authority. In addition, those residents who have been living in supported lodgings or small residential homes since April 1987 now appear, under new paragraph (1ZE), to be about to lose their rights to income support payments towards those fees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, there are people whose fees are topped up by local authorities and who get income support because they were under pension age when they entered care. There is concern about the large number of people who are entering residential care at a relatively young age and a fear that the gap between the fees and income support will grow and grow. There is no certainty that the income support levels will meet that gap or that, over many years, those people or their relatives will have the resources to meet the cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government changed the rules on capital so that individuals have to sell their homes when they enter residential care to enable them to use the money as a contribution towards bridging the cap. All the research shows that capital receipts from the sale of their homes fills the gap for on average, between only five and seven years. Many people are in residential care for much longer than that. Who will fill that gap once their resources and capital have been exhausted? How can that be termed a preserved right in any shape or form? They are preserved inadequacies of the system and there is insufficient information to explain how the gap will be filled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Existing residents will be trapped in a no-man's land by the inadequacy of their preserved rights plus the effect of section 43. How will they find help to make up the difference between their benefits and the fees for the home? The effect of section 43 is that they must be evicted from their current placements before a local authority can step in and help. As I understand the section, the local authority cannot intervene in advance of eviction. It cannot step in and top up someone's benefit because it believes that a placement is appropriate. The person must be evicted and thrown on the mercy of the local authority's new assessment procedure before the local authority can redetermine
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0102">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
what care is appropriate for him or her under the National Health Service and Community Care Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the people affected have become used to living in their homes. They are happy and their relatives are happy with the care that they are receiving but, because of the financial shortfall, they cannot remain where they are. The Minister may say that everything will be all right when the new regulations have been laid. That makes it difficult to debate the issue, because we do not know how the new regulations that will impinge on section 43 will work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been denied proper parliamentary debate, which is worrying. I was on the Standing Committee that considered the national health service and community care. Section 43,
	<br><blockquote><p>"prevents authorities from arranging residential care or nursing home accommodation for people already resident … when the new community care arrangements come into effect. Generally these people will have a preserved entitlement to claim income support at the registered homes rate."</p></blockquote>
That recognises that preserve rights exist, but it is unclear how the local authority will take on its responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister may remember, when we debated the issue on Report, an amendment was tabled to give preserved rights. The Under-Secretary of State for Social Security at the time, the former Member for Windsor and Maidenhead, was active in leading the campaign to recognise the problem. That amendment was agreed on Report. Unfortunately, for other reasons, it did not become part of the Bill. The House clearly recognised that there was a problem, which needed to be addressed. That problem has flowed into the regulations and I am not certain that it will properly be addressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we are only one month away from the implementation of the National Health Service and Community Care Act, we must be clear how people's so-called preserved rights will be safeguarded. I have been contacted about the financial situation in many homes. Many have already gone bust; in some ways, it is better that they did, so that the position of the residents could be sorted out before 1 April. If they have no preserved rights, their assessment can be certain before the new arrangements come into effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People who live in residential and nursing homes are the most vulnerable in our society. Many are too ill, disabled or elderly to fight for their rights. We must ensure that the regulations do not preserve the gap between fees and income support levels, which is increasing and causing financial anxiety and distress to many elderly people. We must ensure that people who are already in residential care have preserved rights if, through no fault of their own, their current accommodation is no longer available, because either the business has gone bust or they can no longer afford to pay the fees and the home tries to evict them. The matter is serious and there is anxiety about it throughout the
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
country. However imperfect our deliberations, I hope that the Minister will reassure us on the points that I have raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.51 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss the regulations and for the comments of the hon. Member for Withington. Before I reply to his specific points, I should be grateful for the Committee's indulgence while I set out the purpose of the regulations. It is inevitable that the debate has already widened. The hon. Gentleman's procedural point illustrated the breadth of issues covered by community care legislation. We are discussing the social security regulations which have already been laid and are due to come into effect in April. It is not possible to have the sort of debate that the hon. Gentleman wants in this forum and to cover all the regulations that may flow from the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990. We are discussing the social security regulations and they can be discussed as an entity. The Department of Health is likely to bring forward regulations based on the section to which the hon. Gentleman referred, but it is important for it to see the regulations before us before it does so. There is interplay between the two, but in dealing with the regulations we can see how the benefits system has altered to take account of the changes being brought forward by community care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The community care reforms were designed to enable people to remain in their own homes wherever possible, to provide proper assessment of care needs and good case management, to promote the development of a flourishing independent sector alongside good quality public services and to secure better value for taxpayers' money. The regulations show how the benefits system is adapting to put those principles for community care into effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Currently, higher levels of income support are available to people in independent residential care and nursing homes to help them to meet their fees if they have insufficient resources of their own. This is a benefit that is intended to bring the income that a person already has up to a set level. For people in homes, that level is the amount of the fees or a set national limit, which ever is the lower, and an allowance for personal expenses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the new community care arrangements from April 1993, people entering residential care and nursing homes will be able to claim income support on a broadly similar basis whether they are in such a home or living in their own home. Additionally, they will be able to receive, as part of their income support entitlement, a new residential allowance as a contribution towards their accommodation costs. Anyone who requires help towards their care costs will, before admission, have approached the local authority, which will assess his or her care needs and will meet any extra cost involved for residents for whom they arrange such care. The local authority will take account of the individual's ability to contribute towards those costs. In deciding the ability of an individual to contribute
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0103">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
towards his or her fees in the care home, the local authority will carry out a financial assessment. That will be broadly aligned to the rules that currently apply to income support under regulations and guidance have been prepared by the Department of Health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In setting out to introduce the new arrangements, we have given paramount importance to the need to reassure existing residents and to avoid imposing too great a task on the local authorities upon whom most of the burden for the new arrangements will fall. To aid the smooth changeover to the new scheme, and to reassure current residents, the present system of income support limits will be preserved in its entirety, including the regular review of the limits, for people already in registered homes at the time of change, even if they are temporarily absent from the home on 31 March 1993 or subsequently leave the home for a short time. Much of the complexity of the package of regulations, which cover housing benefit and disablement benefit—we did not need to discuss them this morning, but they are included in the package of regulations—is due to the provision of that sophisticated system of protection for existing residents across all the benefits involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Withington raised several matters. On shortfall, it is inevitable that some people will contract for fees above the income support limit. Fees are a matter between the home and the residents or their relatives and the Government have no authority to intervene. We have continually made it clear that no Government could meet all fees in full however high they are set. However, we are not aware of any instance of residents who rely on income support being evicted because they could not meet the fees, although residents have sometimes been transferred to other homes. Some homes have closed, but I am not convinced that the closures were a direct result of the amount of help with fees payable through income support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An increasing number of new places are becoming available in residential care and nursing homes and undoubtedly some will close, not necessarily because of the level of income support, but because of other factors associated with the provisions of care and the larger number of places coming into being.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister accept that often people have not been evicted because the shortfall has been made up with grants from charities? Will he further accept that the charities are making it clear that they are running out of money? The opportunity for people to approach charities for help to fill the gap is diminishing all the time and the problem is growing all the time as more and more elderly people seek such grants because of the shortfall. How will the Government react when the charities turn off the tap of money that makes up the difference between fees and income support levels?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman puts forward a hypothesis. The system at present is that income support in many case matches the fees. When that is not
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
so, top up is available and I understand that will remain the case in the future. The hon. Gentleman knows that even under the new system it will be possible for relatives and others to provide extra sums to meet any gap between income support plus residential allowance and fees. We expect the circumstances appertaining at present—that is, that people are not being evicted because of that problem—to continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the hon. Gentleman that the Department of Health is aware of his anxiety, but local authorities can step in before there is any question of eviction and that will remain so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not expect it to be the case and it is certainly not the law that someone must be evicted before the local authority can step in to provide support. Because local authorities will have responsibility to make contracts with homes in the best possible way and to use the money that is being transferred, we expect that the vast majority of cases the allowances provided out of public funds will match the fees being demanded. If there is a shortfall, the existing system, which allows top-up, will continue. As the problem has not yet arisen, I do not see why it should arise in the acute form that the hon. Gentleman fears.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So that we are absolutely clear on what the Minister is saying, will he give an absolute assurance that the local authority will be able to meet the shortfall of the fees for everyone who is currently in a residential home, whether or not the local authority has a contract with that home after 1 April? The local authority should be able to step in and immediately make the top-up from the local authority's resources under the community care regulations, thereby ensuring that the individual remains in the home that he or she was previously living in, regardless of the home's relationship with the local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the local authority will have the power to do exactly what the hon. Gentleman wants, but, that that will be left to the local authority's discretion. I am sure that it would be the intention of all of us to ensure that elderly people continue to live in the same homes in which they are living. The regulations aim to provide that the present income support system that sustains people in residential and nursing home care will continue so that there is continuity and simplicity in the new arrangements. The limits will continue to be revised in the way that they have been revised until now. The consequences that the hon. Gentleman fears should not arise as local authority will retain the ability to step in and prevent them. It will be left to the discretion of the local authority to act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to be absolutely clear about what the Minister says. Is he confirming that, when the regulations are laid under section 43 of the 1990 Act, they will include those preserved rights and will provide the opportunity for local authorities to make top-ups in all cases?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that the Department of Health has a responsibility in this case and that regulations are to be laid in the future. I am afraid that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0104">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
he is asking me to trespass on matters that will be covered by the Department of Health and its regulations. The regulations will be subject to future scrutiny, when the hon. Gentleman will be able to ask questions about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have given the position in respect of the way in which the Department of Social Security considers that the system will work. The precise assurance that the hon. Gentleman wants is a matter for the regulations that are to be brought forward by the Department of Health. I genuinely cannot be of further assistance to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Dickens 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Littleborough and Saddleworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware of the tremendous financial pressure on private residential care and nursing homes because of current legislation? Most local authorities have strict rules concerning the relationship between double and single rooms. Many of those homes are having to reduce the number of double rooms compared to the number of single rooms. That reduction has a tremendous impact on their finances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The biggest problem is that although local authorities have allowed themselves three years to match the new rules and regulations and put themselves on the preferred list, the private residential care and nursing homes have had to make changes immediately, otherwise they would not be included on the list. That means that those homes are at a terrible disadvantage, but if I say more my hon. Friend the Minister might say that we are straying back on to the other ground again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear that I have to tell my hon. Friend exactly that. The complex nature of the introduction of community care has meant that a close relationship between the Departments of Health and Social Security and local authorities has developed. Sometimes that relationship has been difficult to disentangle. I must make it clear that the responsibility for the care component of the community care regulations lies between the Department of Health, local authorities and homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government recognise the tremendous contribution that has been made over the past decade by the independent private and voluntary sectors to the care of the elderly. I am sure that, without their efforts to provide care to the elderly, we would not have been able to look after those people in the way that we have. Sometimes, many homes feel that they are under onerous pressure. It is naturally important to the Government that the best possible service is provided for our elderly people and there will be times when regulations are introduced that the homes find difficult to live with. We also want to ensure that homes are able to continue to give the help and assistance that they want to provide and that the regulations are not too onerous and burdensome. It is that balance that my colleagues in the Department of Health will want to preserve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that we are impinging on Department of Health matters. That reinforces my point of order; I said that there was a difficulty in giving
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
absolute assurances about how the so-called preserved group would be treated in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 43 of the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to subsection (3) of this section, no accommodation may be provided under section 21 or 26 or this Act for any person who immediately before the date on which this section comes into force was ordinarily resident in relevant premises."</p></blockquote>
Subsection (3) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may by regulations provide that, in such cases and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed, subsection (1) of this section shall not apply in relation to such classes of persons as may be prescribed in the regulations."</p></blockquote>
Regulations might be made to clarify the matter but, by implication, the preserved rights will flow through only to certain classes of persons in the new arrangements under the 1990 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want assurances that the preserved right, as it is called by the Department of Social Security, will be a genuine preserved right for those who enjoy income support. I do not want groups of people to be denied their preserved rights because of the inadequacy of the benefit and the growing gap between income support and fees which cannot be topped up by the local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in some difficulty because the hon. Gentleman has strayed from the regulations. I reassure him that the Department of Health is aware of the concerns that he expressed. I understand that the Department of Health has consulted local authorities on his points. It will introduce regulations to deal with those issues. I am unable to deal with those issues today because my sole concern is with the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman has oriented his remarks away from the regulations. I hope that that means that our explanation for what we have set out on income support, housing benefit, attendance allowance and disability living allowance is accepted as a reasonable response to changes in community care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would be a total misrepresentation of my position. I do not believe that I can give that confident assurance for the preserved rights unless I know how the Department of Health intends to deal with people if they cannot fill the gap. That is the issue before us. I should be happier if the Minister changed the subject of regulation 3 from "preserved rights" to "preserved gap". That would flow through to the regulations that will be introduced by the Department of Health to show how the preserved gap would be filled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to put it on record that I will not be satisfied with the regulations until I am clear that all people with the so-called preserved rights will have real rights and security of accommodation when the Department of Health takes over responsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is an appropriate time for me to respond to the important point raised by the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0105">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
hon. Members for Withington and for Roxburgh and Berwickshire. Under Standing Order No. 101, the duty of the Committee is to consider the statutory instrument. It has no other powers. The statutory instrument has been referred to the Committee by the House and, in that sense, normal procedures have been followed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir James. We have taken this argument as far as we can. I appreciate the comments by the hon. Member for Withington and do not wish to leave him in any doubt that his concerns are being considered by the Department of Health. I am sure that when the regulations are brought forward, his concerns will be satisfied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps it would help the Committee were I briefly to describe the rest of the regulations. The regulations allow for the introduction of a residential allowance. The decision to introduce a residential allowance as part of a person's income support entitlement, rather than as part of housing benefit as originally proposed, provides a simplification for individuals and local authorities involved. It is also beneficial in that when people enter homes for a period of respite care, they will continue to be able to receive housing benefit for their home address.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been universally recognised that the ability to provide support through respite care is one of the great successes of the regulations. We all recognise the value of a person providing care—perhaps a close relative, often in difficult circumstances—to have a break. That is why we want to encourage respite care through the regulations, which provide that residential allowance will be paid for a short period of care. We have specifically not restricted the frequency or length of respite care periods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the Committee's attention to an improvement for those using respite care. Unlike income support, which will be taken into account when considering a person's ability to contribute towards care costs, local authorities will be able to ignore attendance allowance and disability living allowance during the four weeks for which it remains in payment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I use this intervention to raise the definition of residential accommodation in the regulation? under the regulations, the residential allowance can be paid to homes in the ownership of local authorities. Many local authorities lease such accommodation to voluntary organisations. Is it within the interpretation of the regulations that, where such a leasing arrangement has been made, that will be classed as ownership in terms of the ability for the residential allowance to be paid?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That might be a matter on which I shall have to write to the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rest of the regulations relate to changes that we have had to make to housing benefit. Although the majority of care home residents already rely on income support to help pay their fees, a minority can claim housing benefit instead. As I have explained, the new
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
income support residential allowance is designed to provide a contribution to housing costs for those entering care homes from April 1993 who need public support. The regulations provide that housing benefit should not be available to people with an actual or a potential entitlement to the residential allowance. That measure is consistent with our continuing policy that help with accommodation costs for the majority of people in care homes should be provided through income support, and will avoid creating any anomalies to the provision in the benefits system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reassure hon. Members that the regulations do nothing to disturb the rules which allow the continued payment of housing benefit for a person's main home while that person is living temporarily in a residential home for a period of respite care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been mindful of the need to protect the minority in care homes who are entitled to housing benefit at the point of change—to return to a form of preserved rights, in this case transitional protection of housing benefit. Therefore, we have taken measures to ensure that those people will retain their entitlement to housing benefit for as long as they live in the same home. However, if they move permanently to a new home, we believe it right that they become subject to the same arrangements as other residents and that they rely on income support for help with their fees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations provide that the small group that is granted preserved rights to housing benefit for care home fees under previous legislation should retain those rights indefinitely on the same basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations have been dealt with by the Social Security Advisory Committee. In his response to that committee's report, the Secretary of State said that the Government welcomed the SSAC's general acceptance of the draft regulations, which arise as a natural concomitant to the new care in the community arrangements. One of the main concerns that emerged from the SSAC's report was that the introduction of the regulations be carefully monitored to identify quickly any problems. We were then, and we are now, happy to reassure the Committee of our intention carefully to evaluate the effectiveness of the Department's new community care arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the debate, it has become clear that the regulations introduce several good and important measures, which support the Government's general care in the community policy. I have undertaken to inform the Department of Health of the concerns of the hon. Member for Withington, to whom I am sure it will respond in due course. I shall clear up the matter that he put to me about the ownership of homes as soon as possible. I hope that hon. Members accept that the provisions contained in the regulations are intended simply to implement the long-planned community care arrangements. The new arrangements, which have generally received cross-party support, have been well received and recognised as a real improvement in care provision. Therefore, I commend the regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

From the explanation that we have heard this morning, it seems even more important that we should wait to see the regulations that will be introduced by the Department of Health so that we may determine how they interact with the regulations before the Committee. Our sole concern is to protect vulnerable people who live in residential care homes. Such people want the preserved right to remain in their homes for as long as they wish. As we need to consider the Depart-
