<br><br><!-- lb --> Arrangements) Order 1993</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Charles Wardle)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Channel Tunnel (International Arrangements) Order 1993.</p></blockquote>
In welcoming you to the Chair, Dr. Blackburn, let me say that I shall be brief and shall treat the order with as much dispatch as I can, but as it involves a series of technicalities, it may be convenient for me to go through them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order provides the legal backing for policing and frontier controls for the channel tunnel and makes all the necessary consequential provisions for co-operation and assistance between the United Kingdom and France. The order introduces no new controls, but new methods of exercising controls that exist already. It is the technicalities that follow from that concept that will be of interest to the Committee. The order will adapt our current procedures to the unique physical circumstances of the tunnel. The tunnel is being built with private money and will run as a commercial enterprise, but the British and French Governments have an important role in supervising the construction and operation of what will be a new, high-profile transportation system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within Government the principal responsibility for the tunnel rests with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport and I do not intend to trespass on his responsibilities today. Later in the year he will introduce other orders, under the Channel Tunnel Act 1987, to deal with security and road traffic matters and the House will have an opportunity to debate those issues then. My concerns, and those with which the order deals, and which will interest the Committee, relate to the practicalities of how we shall police the channel tunnel, deal with offenders and carry out controls on people and goods entering and leaving the United Kingdom through the tunnel. The Home Office is just one of several Departments with an interest in those matters. The order encompasses the requirements of the police, the courts and all the frontier control authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Frontier controls in the tunnel will be juxtaposed at the terminals at Cheriton and Coquelles. The framework for operating juxtaposed controls is set out in a protocol signed at Sangatte in 1991. Some of the provisions of that protocol constitute schedule 2 to the order. Entry controls to the United Kingdom will be completed before shuttle passengers board the shuttle trains. Travellers will find juxtaposed French departure and British arrival controls at Coquelles and a similar arrangement will apply in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
reverse at Cheriton. Passengers on the shuttle trains will go through ticketing booths and then through the departure and the arrival controls in rapid succession in the control zone. The physical layout of the controls will resemble those with which we are familiar, such as the controls at Dover Eastern docks. The area in which officers will be permitted to work—known as the "control zone"—has been agreed between the United Kingdom and French authorities and will be clearly marked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principles of juxtaposition also apply to the through trains that will operate between Paris and London initially and, in due course, from destinations that are further afield, although the practicalities are somewhat different. For those services the trains themselves will be the control zone and immigration checks on arriving passengers will usually take place on board. I say "usually" because sometimes, for operational reasons, that may not be feasible and so controls will be carried out at the point of arrival, such as at Waterloo. For a train with a large crowd of unruly football hooligans or some other group, it may make more sense to carry out controls at Waterloo. Arrangements will be made to put the controls into practice when the train arrives at Waterloo. In the case of the tunnel, like that of all our ports of entry we are maintaining passport checks on all non-EC nationals supported by a light check of EC nationals simply to guard against the possibility of abuse of the EC channel by others. We also attach importance to maintaining the checks necessary for the prevention of terrorism. For those reasons the order extends the provisions of the Immigration Act 1971 and the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1989 to cover passengers arriving and leaving through the channel tunnel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The controls on crossing the frontier through the tunnel will be identical to those exercised at other places of entry. Routine customs checks—as the Committee will be aware—are now a thing of the past and customs checks are increasingly based on intelligence. Border checks on passengers and freight are carefully targeted to prevent the smuggling of drugs, firearms and other illicit material. Similarly, public health and animal health checks will be conducted selectively where there are grounds for suspicion that our requirements are not being met. In that way we shall ensure that the channel tunnel presents no greater risk to the integrity of our port controls than any other point of entry into the United Kingdom
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the order. The nature of the tunnel system and its division by the frontier—the frontier is at a mid point in the tunnel and, as it were, under the water—creates unusual circumstances in which to maintain law and order. Articles 38 to 41 of the protocol create a special jurisdiction regime for the tunnel. That is necessary because in the United Kingdom our courts enjoy a territorially based jurisdiction. Without the special jurisdictional regime, difficult problems might arise. For example, a passenger may board a train in Paris and discover on arrival in London that his wallet has been stolen. The offence could have occurred in France, in the tunnel or in England. It would be nonsense if when the culprit was detected he could not be tried because the locus of the offence was uncertain. The order lays down clear groundrules to enable the relevant authorities to decide how to deal with suspected offences and, by means of article 3, gives the courts full legal authority to try and to sentence defendants who are brought before them for offences associated with the channel tunnel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0763">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
I shall now focus more closely on the main provisions of the order as they relate to each frontier control authority and describe how they will operate. I shall deal with the police first. British police officers will have two main functions in the channel tunnel. While in the control zone on the French side they will exercise frontier controls, principally under the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1989. On the United Kingdom side of the frontier they will carry out their normal law and order duties. Furthermore, special provisions have been made in the order to meet the particular policing needs of the tunnels themselves, where it may not always be apparent on which side of the frontier an offence is being committed and where stopping a train to deal with it would not be feasible. One of them is contained in paragraph 2(4) of schedule 3 and it gives effect to article 40 of the protocol. Under that section, United Kingdom police officers may make arrests in accordance with English law in a very limited area of France in the fixed link where a person is caught in the act of committing or attempting to commit an offence or has just done so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 2(5) provides a complementary power implementing article 39 of the protocol so that if an arrest is made on board a train in England en route to France, the legality of the arrest is not affected by the fact that the train continues on to French territory. When the train arrives in France the suspect must be handed over to the French authorities for them to determine formally where jurisdiction lies. Reciprocal arrangements will be made by the French to mirror those procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In cases where the French decide that jurisdiction rests with our courts, the suspect may be brought back to England as though he had remained under arrest the whole time. Similarly where an officer has made an arrest in a control zone under the provisions of article 10 of the protocol—one relating to a frontier control offence or an arrest of a person sought by the United Kingdom authorities—he may continue to hold the detainee in the control zone and return to the United Kingdom with him without referring the matter to the French authorities. That is, from the control zone at Coqueller. Those procedures have been specially designed to respond to the particular needs of working in the channel tunnel. Without those arrangements, extradition proceedings would have to be implemented—that would be excessive in the context of the working practices of the tunnel, where officers will be carrying out their duties in a clearly defined and limited area. However, if the suspect leaves the control zone, other than in lawful custody, there will be no question of simply retrieving him from wherever he may be: there is no general power of extra-territorial arrest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have spoken about the police and I turn to the powers available to immigration officers. The order modifies the Immigration Act 1971 to apply it to the tunnel. Sub-paragraph (2) of schedule 4 modifies section 3 of the 1971 Act so that a passenger will be regarded as having left the United Kingdom for immigration purposes if he seeks entry to France at Cheriton and is refused it by the French authorities. In those circumstances, when he arrives back at our control point his request for leave to enter will be looked at afresh—just as though he had crossed the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
channel on a ferry and returned having been refused entry in France, even though all of that will take place within the control zone at Cheriton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also had to introduce for immigration purposes, a new interpretation of what constitutes entry to the United Kingdom by way of the tunnel services. What we have proposed is a simple solution which can be applied to all the train services. The provisions in paragraph 1(5) of schedule 4 are conceptually similar to those which apply at airports. Thus, a passenger will enter the United Kingdom for immigration purposes when he leaves a control area designated as such under the Immigration Act 1971. For arriving shuttle passengers, that will be when they leave the Cheriton terminal. Through-train passengers will enter the United Kingdom when they leave the designated control area at, for example, Ashford or Waterloo or, in the case of those on board a north-of-London train, when the train itself ceases to be a designated control area aafter leaving Olympia on its way to other parts of the United Kingdom. I am looking to the future as I illustrate those possibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The entry point for the purposes of Customs legislation has to be a little different. I hope that the Committee will allow me to proceed at this pace because I realise that I am spraying references at a fair rate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bob Dunn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dartford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend clear up a matter which has been raised with me—the position of an illegal immigrant? If an illegal immigrant is discovered on an aircraft and his or her documentation is not in order, a financial penalty falls on the carrier. Will he explain how that applies to an illegal immigrant who arrives in the United Kingdom by train with out-of-order documents?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr, Wardle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will certainly answer my hon. Friend's point. First, such a person would not be discovered on an aircraft. His or her illegal status would be established on arrival at an airport. We have carefully considered applying the provisions of the Immigration (Carriers Liability) Act 1987 to channel tunnel trains, but having taken into account the methods by which immigration controls will be applied, we find that that would not be practicable, workable or realistic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, passengers on shuttle trains will pass through the ticket booth in the departure control and arrival control within the control zone in rapid succession. So the immigration officers can conduct checks and make a decision whether to refuse entry before the train leaves the United Kingdom. That is very different from the position of a ferry operator or an airline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to my reference to Customs, paragraph 10 of part II of schedule 5 provides that goods are treated as imported into the United Kingdom when they are brought into the control zone at Coquelles or when inward controls become exercisable on board the through trains. This is essential, for example, to prevent people detected with illicit goods in the control zone from arguing that they had no intention of introducing them into the United Kingdom but happened to have them on their persons. Presumably, they intended to leave them on the train. Such a loophole would make nonsense of the juxtaposed controls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 was modified in 1990 at the time of the breakthrough of the service tunnel in order to extend provisions in it that relate to ships and aircraft to trains arriving in or leaving the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0764">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
United Kingdom through the tunnel system. The detailed changes proposed in this order must, therefore, be seen in the context of the application of that Act as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order has many tentacles, which I am seeking to describe. Many of its provisions apply already to trains because trains are included in the definition of "vehicles" in the Act. The excercise of Customs and Excise powers in general has been constrained by section 4 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 1992, so as not to impede the free movement of persons or goods between member states except in certain specified circumstances. Nothing contained in the order will detract from those overriding principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned earlier that, on present plans, the controls on passengers using through trains would usually be carried out during the journey. That will not be so with Customs and Excise controls on the inter-capital services—Paris to London or Brussels to London. For trains terminating in London, Customs and Excise will operate an airport-style static control at the terminal. Waterloo represents a natural break in the journey and Customs and Excise believes that a static control will be to everyone's benefit. The majority of passengers will suffer no inconvenience as they proceed through. Those who are selected for questioning will have more privacy. The needs of Customs and Excise to relate baggage to passengers will be that much easier and the whole operation will be more cost-effective. On the other hand, for the trains destined for regions beyond London where there is no natural break in the journey, Customs and Excise will carry out its controls on board the train. In those circumstances, there is no practical alternative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fry 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wellingborough)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend referred to Customs control being situated, in effect, at the terminal points. British Rail is worried about what will happen in the event of an emergency, such as a bomb scare, resulting in the closure of the terminal point. In those circumstances, passengers might be allowed to leave the train at another point. It is clear from the order that there will have to be a suspension of paragraph 26(1) of schedule 4 to enable that to take place. British Rail simply wants the right in an emergency to obviate that. I accept the problem that would arise for Customs, but will my hon. Friend assure the Committee that such a concern is recognised? Can such a change to the law be made fairly quickly because considerable delay will only cause confusion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important point. I am sure that the Committee will want to know that my officials are holding discussions with British Rail about emergency arrangements. Paragraph 26 is not relevant to the circumstances to which my hon. Friend referred. If a train is forced to stop because it has broken down or there has been an accident, the safety and security of passengers will be the first priority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the close co-operation between my officials and the railway operators in ensuring that the necessary arrangements are made to meet the needs of all those involved. The point that my hon. Friend made has been taken—please forgive the pun—on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now want to deal with the provisions in the order relating to rabies defence measures and public health. Part II of schedule 3 deals with the measures that the concessionaires will have to take on the United Kingdom side of the tunnel system to prevent colonisation by rodents and to prevent animals from making their way
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
through the tunnel. The physical barriers will help to prevent animals from making their own way through the system. I assure the Committee that they would have to be super rodents to get through because there will be deep-dug security fences based in concrete well below ground. There will also be closed circuit television, not to mention the trains themselves. It would be a persistent and, I think, lucky rodent that managed to get anywhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Toby Jessel 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Twickenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the rodent be unable to get through the space through which the train goes? Presumably the rodent will be smaller than the train.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a most important point. The rodent, but not the train, will be deterred, if not destroyed by an electrified grid that will take account of precisely what he described. The larger risk of the introduction of rabies into this country, which exists now in our ports of entry, comes from those irresponsible people who smuggle animals upon their person or about their baggage. The controls here would be the same as at other ports of entry. Customs and Excise retains the power to deal with illegally imported animals and other authorities will be watchful for any breaches of our laws.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have described what our officers will be doing at the terminal in England and in the control zone in France, but there is another aspect to the question. By introducing parts of the protocol into English law by means of article 3(2), we are also giving French officers the legal backing to carry out their functions in the control zone in England. The French officers concerned are from the Police de l'Air et des Frontières—the PAF—and the Douane, the French Customs. They will be responsible for controlling persons and goods entering and leaving France on the same basis under French law as at any other of their frontiers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 7 gives effect to one specific provision in the protocol relating to the carriage of firearms by French officers within the control zone. French officers will be allowed to possess firearms in the exercise of their functions within the Cheriton control zone without holding a firearms certificate. The area in which arms may be openly carried, and the attached conditions, are the subject of administrative arrangements with the French authorities. It may be for the convenience of the Committee, Dr. Blackburn, if I say that I believe that the Select Committee examined the matter recently and accepted the principle that I have described. The French police and Customs officers will be allowed to carry firearms on their person only within the control zone—that is, from the booths and on the road from the booths to the loading platforms. At any one time, there will be two police and two Customs officers within that control zone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this country, there is no tradition of officers routinely bearing arms. However, we must recognise that the French authorities have such a tradition. We must balance the expectations of their officers while they are actively exercising the full range of their powers by ensuring that they do so only under those circumstances. Should any French officer act outside the exercise of his function and misuse a firearm he will be answerable to our courts.

I mentioned that reciprocal arrangements had been made in France to implement the protocol. The French can achieve that more simply than we merely by incorporating the protocol into French law. To that end, the protocol recently has been approved by the French Senate. If this order is approved, it will be brought into effect jointly on a date to be agreed between the United

Kingdom and France. Although the opening date of the tunnel may be a little way away yet, the commissioning of the transportation system has begun. It is desirable to have these powers available sooner rather than later, to cater for all eventualities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is more than belt and braces. I hope that I have demonstrated that the approach is thorough. However, it applies the controls that are available in the Immigration Act 1971 to new circumstances in which a train will cross a frontier into this country. The order applies those provisions in a way that is relevant to the new circumstances which are physically different from what is involved when airplanes or ferries arrive from across the water.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have only outlined the order, but I hope that I have touched on its most important elements. I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Several Hon. Members</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I advise the Committee that I intend rigorously to enforce Standing Order No. 101 which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any Member, not being a member of such a standing committee, may take part in the deliberations of the committee, but shall not vote or make any motion or move any amendment or be counted in the quorum."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.55 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for making the position clear, Dr. Blackburn. My colleague, who should have been dealing with the statutory instrument, is required in the Chamber, so I have had to stand in at relatively short notice. I shall observe your strictures and not exceed my rights in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statutory instrument is exceedingly complex, as the Minister acknowledged. I am grateful to him for being so helpful. He is in some difficulty, as we all are, because this complex measure should originally have been part of the Channel Tunnel Act 1987.I understand that the provision was withdrawn because of its complexity and because negotiations and discussions were still taking place. Had it been left in the original Bill, it would have been subject to the usual processes of Second Reading, Committee and Report stages in both Houses, so would have had much more detailed scrutiny than is possible in a statutory instruments Committee. We can only probe and then either agree or disagree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should make it clear that we do not intend to obstruct the important process of reaching agreement, but there are important issues to discuss, as has been shown by the questions asked by Conservative Members. The explanatory memorandum refers to administrative agreements. Will the Minister explain the processes that will be involved, in terms both of reaching agreement and the scrutiny of those agreements? I understand that those administrative agreements will be reached by discussion between the police, Customs and immigration authorities in this country and the relevant authorities in France. That makes sense, but the Committee should be aware of the nature of those agreements. Will the Minister say what
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
arrangements will be made to inform us, to ensure that the agreements are properly understood? As they will not have the force of a statutory instrument, they will not be scrutinised in Committee, but they should be subject to some sort of scrutiny in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the Secretary of State for Transport would introduce regulations covering his responsibilities, and the Minister referred to security and road traffic responsibilities. Will he outline which of the security responsibilities of the Secretary of State for Transport will be affected by the further subsidiary legislation and how that relates to the responsibilities for which the Minister himself is accountable, which are dealt with in the statutory instrument that we are considering today? He referred to the interest in the statutory instrument of several Departments. Given the complexity of the arrangements, I understand the reason for that. However, can I assume that the Minister speaks on behalf of all those Departments today? Is he satisifed that the relationship of the responsibilities between his Department and others was fully taken into account when the detail of this statutory instrument was prepared?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke of circumstances when the normal processes could not be observed while on a train and said that sometimes arrangements would have to be made at Waterloo. I appreciate his argument. Sometimes it would be difficult to exercise those processes in transit. Will the Minister say a little more about those arrangements? How will they be ordered? What effect will that have on the responsibilities of, primarily, the police, I suppose, and perhaps the immigration and customs authorities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister tell us about staffing at the French end—that is, where there will be British jurisdiction in the tunnel and on the other side? The staffing implications for police and Customs are important. The adequacy of staffing for Customs and police has come into question generally in recent months. It has been assumed that there will be a reduction in Customs cover with the completion of the single European market. But, plainly, serious requirements will arise from these arrangements. The Minister should satisfy us that there will be adequate staff and arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Animals are an important factor and this subject is referred to in the Explanatory Note. There has been the greatest public concern on that issue over the years running up to the opening of the tunnel. Will the Minister tell us more about the arrangements relating to animals? Clearly, he and any officials would want to ensure that the arrangements are satisfactory. As the Minister may accept, all too often we may be told that something is satisfactory only to discover later that problems have arisen. As our time in Committee is limited today, will he tell us a little more about those arrangements and perhaps write to members of the Committee afterwards about the details? It is clear from one of the questions asked that it is a matter of concern to Members on both sides of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order refers to fire fighting, but not in much detail. I think that I am correct in saying that the Minister did not specifically mention fire fighting in his speech. How will the detail be scrutinised? It is one thing to say that there must be complementary arrangements between the French and British authorities, but how will that be ensured?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Plainly, the fire and emergency services have responsibilities for fire issues. That is an important aspect when dealing with something as contained as the tunnel. In addition, there is much dependence on the fire services for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0766">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
various kinds of emergency cover, some of which are not always allowed for in the financial arrangements for fire service authorities. That aspect has particular relevance for the tunnel. Which authority will be responsible for the fire and emergency arrangements in the tunnel? How will the funding be arranged? How will it be ensured that that covers all the functions that we shall reasonably expect the fire service to carry out? Non-fire responsibilities are always a bone of contention in terms of financial arrangements. I should be grateful if the Minister would assist us on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of civil emergency was raised by a Conservative Member. There is general concern about the planning for emergency provisions. Only last week, in a statutory instrument Committee that dealt with proposals to replace the old civil defence arrangements, I said that there was a need for fresh, primary legislation. It has been called for by emergency and civil defence authorities and fire authorities around the country. Will the Minister explain more about planning for emergencies, both in terminals and in the tunnel? You, Dr. Blackburn, would accept that that is an important issue on which the public should be given reassurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of carriers liability is not dealt with in the statutory instrument and I should be grateful if the Minister would explain the way in which it will be covered. There has been a request from several authorities, including the Chamber of Shipping of the United Kingdom and the Passenger Shipping Association, for the extension of the Immigration (Carriers Liability) Act 1987 to cover the channel tunnel. The Minister may say that the issue will be in the statutory instrument to be dealt with later by the Secretary of State for Transport. If that is the case, we should not deal with that matter today. If it will not be dealt with in that way and the Minister cannot tell us how it will be dealt with, he should explain why it is not covered in this particular statutory instrument. We would have expected it to be covered now, rather than later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The French police have much wider powers to stop and demand papers than British police constables. To what extent will those powers be exercisable within the British half of the control zone? I accept fully that we must have elasticity across borders to allow for the necessary complexity of arrangements between the two countries. But, that necessary complexity raises questions about the different powers of officers of the French and British jurisdictions. I want to be a little more satisfied that that issue has been explored fully by the Minister. Officers of the French jurisdiction have many powers and different rules, which must be explained to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to the fact that the French police carry firearms as a matter of routine. My understanding is that that applies not only to gendarmes and other police officers or their equivalent, but to customs officers. How does that affect the arrangements and how precisely is it covered in the statutory instrument? It seems to be dealt with partly under the administrative arrangements, so is not explicit in this statutory instrument. That is one area on which the House should be satisfied, rather than simply being told that that will be dealt with in administrative arrangements. We have concerns that should be satisfied now. If matters have not been finalised, we wish to hear from the Minister how he will satisfy us later on. In particular, we need to know how the different jurisdictions
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
and requirements on firearms are to be satisfied on British soil, including the control and use of firearms by French police operating on British soil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is then the question of how ethnic minorities are dealt with. That has been a bone of contention and a cause of complaint. Complaints have been made in some quarters—I put it with care—that the arrangements in France have sometimes been less sympathetic than those in this country. In my previous career, working with young people, I came across incidents on both sides of the channel that have caused a little disquiet. Arrangements need to be made to ensure that such matters are dealt with sensitively. What arrangements have been made to ensure that the highest standards are observed on both sides of the channel—by the French and the British authorities—in the application of all sorts of regulations that apply in relation to ethnic minorities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the question of police complaints. Complaints raised against the police are always sensitive matters. I suspect that it will be even more difficult to deal properly with those complaints in the control zones on either side of the channel tunnel and within it. Where should complainants go? Should they complain through the normal complaints process in the United Kingdom against British police acting in France and vice versa in relation to France? It is important to make such information explicit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statutory instrument also refers to data protection. I understand that it allows exemptions to French officers processing data in the control zone and vice versa. There are reciprocal arrangements between the French and British police authorities on the exchange of data. This is always a difficult area. I find it so, Dr. Blackburn; although perhaps you and other hon. Members do not. I should be grateful if the Minister would explain how the regulations and relevant legislation will apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the Minister should explain fully what British police will be able to do in French territory—the British control zone at the French end of the tunnel. I am not certain whether I am correct, but I understand that we are limited to acting under the Prevention of Terrorism Acts or in relation to people wanted on warrant. Other frontier control duties exist, but those powers are not exerciseable by police in the normal course of events.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Police officers in the United Kingdom have the full power of police constables. Will the police have those full powers in the control zone or will they be limited to Prevention of Terrorism Acts and wanted persons powers? That would be relevant for people arriving in the United Kingdom in a boat. If someone who is drunk or behaves in a way that requires the attention of a constable gets off a boat, the power of officers to intervene—not in relation to frontiers—is quite clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Their powers to intervene in the control zone are less clear. Obviously, there must be close co-operation between British and French authorities. There will need to be a good understanding between them I know that discussions are taking place between British and French police on those matters, but we need to know clearly what powers can be exercised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress that I have had an extremely short time to try to comprehend the order. The series of questions that I have asked shows its complexity, which makes it inappropriate for the statutory instrument procedure. As I said at the beginning, our objection to the measures being introduced in this way will not lead us to obstruct them or
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0767">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
vote against them today. However, we should note that this inadequate process does not allow us to give the measures the fuller consideration that would have been possible if they had been dealt with in primary legislation, as originally considered appropriate. If the Government had introduced supplementary primary legislation, these matters could have been expeditiously considered by both Houses. We certainly would have co-operated, as we are co-operating today. A series of matters needs to be dealt with, but it cannot be dealt with satisfactorily today. I am certain that the Minister will do his best to meet the challenge—a challenge offered not by me, but by a procedure that is unsatisfactory to us both. I suspect that the Minister and I agree at least on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the provisions on animal control. Phrases such as
	<br><blockquote><p>"so far as is practicable"</p></blockquote>
appear frequently. Paragraph 4 of part II of schedule 3 provides for the installation of fencing and electrical controls. Are the defences against rabies fully secure? Paragraph 5 seems to deal with stray animals in the tunnel itself rather than animals transported by passengers. Paragraph 2 is about animals being lawfully transported "through the tunnel system". Further details of those arrangements would be useful, although perhaps not now, as I realise that the Minister's time is limited. Paragraph 2 refers to "some duly authenticated documents". That seems to be a vague formulation. Will the Minister explain precisely what that means? How far does the phrase "so far as is practicable" allow the application of common sense? Or, does it allow rather wider discretion, which hon. Members might not find satisfactory?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have done my best—at a speed that matches the Minister's—to raise those questions that, on first examination, seem appropriate to our consideration of the order. I cannot raise all the questions that should be asked. Thus, I express my reservations about the nature of the statutory instrument process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If the Minister accepts the invitation of the hon.

As the only member of the Committee from the county of Kent—the county most directly affected by the channel tunnel and the high-speed rail link, which will go through my constituency to London—I wish to raise three subjects that have already been mentioned. In dealing first with my earlier intervention, I should be pleased if my hon. Friend the Minister would write to me outlining the arrangements for the detention of illegal immigrants and the penalties that may accrue to those responsible for carrying them. If no argument can be made for distinguishing between the railway service and other forms of entry into the country, we should seek to ensure that the high-speed rail link and the rail service operate on all fours with other forms of transport into the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
I wish to pursue the matters of policing and emergency arrangements. I listened with interest to the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael). I shall proceed from a different point, namely the burden of the cost to the people of Kent of policing and emergency-cover services. We have been advised by the Home Office, over the years, of an annual increase in the size of our policing and fire services. On examination, the figures reveal that most of that increase is attached to the channel tunnel and related works and does not have a direct bearing on policing and staffing levels for the whole of Kent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way, because I knew that I would overlook something. My remarks on the financing of policing the authorities were supposed to relate specifically to Kent. The hon. Gentleman is raising an important matter. I can assure him that I am very sympathetic to the police authority in Kent. The area at the end of the rail link is covered by the Metropolitan police, so police will be involved at the end of the tunnel, at the end of the line, and in areas in-between, especially in emergencies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister say which authority is ultimately responsible for planning emergency cover, anti-terrorist activity, and so on? Kent county council needs reassurance on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the House debated the channel tunnel some years ago, apart from the worry about terrorism and the possibility of the tunnel being used for an act of extreme terrorism, my colleagues and I had the largest mailbag on the subject of rabies. We on the Conservative Benches want nothing rabid coming through the channel tunnel, whether it be animal, Socialist or Liberal Democrat. We want a completely rabid-free tunnel. Will the Minister explain to me and my colleagues in Kent the anti-rabies arrangements? That will go a long way towards reassuring our constituents that everything has been done to retard the movement via Kent of rabid animals and other things.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.23 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jesscl</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point, I should be grateful if my hon. Friend the Minister would clarify how rabid rodents will be prevented from running along the rail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am loathe to prolong the debate, but want to reiterate the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Dartford (Mr. Dunn). Will my hon. Friend the Minister write to me about my comments on paragraph 26(1) of schedule 4? It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Persons operating international services shall not, without the approval of the Secretary of State, arrange for any through train to stop the purpose of enabling passengers to leave it except at a terminal control point."</p></blockquote>
There is a legitimate point to answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under paragraph 27(2), I understand that the Department wishes to retain the right to insist on the names of passengers on certain trains being supplied. I have a copy of a letter from Mr. Boiling to EPS Ltd, which states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"we do consider that there could be some value in retaining this requirement for through trains; although we do not envisage routinely applying it to European Passenger Services."</p></blockquote>
The idea is that this will apply to small, unusual and irregular services. Will my hon. Friend make it clear that there is no question that it will apply to everyday services through the tunnel? The ferries and major airlines do not need that sort of impediment and it would be unfair treatment for British Rail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.25 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Dowd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lewisham, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: People in south-east London are delighted not to be getting a high speed link. I ask the Minister to clarify a point relating to through trains. Obviously, all trains from this side of the channel will originate in the United Kingdom but not all of them will be destined for France only. Equally, all trains coming from the other side will not necessarily have originated in France. Will the Minister assure us that the arrangements for the trains are identical, regardless of their origin on the other side of the tunnel?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.27 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I commend the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth. Despite short notice, he asked a lot of questions, many of which are pertinent to our deliberations. I shall deal with them in the sequence in which he raised them but, first, I shall answer, on a last in, first out basis, questions asked by other hon. Members. That is also an accountancy principle although I am not an accountant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Dowd) that the treatment of checks on through trains will be identical. That applies to through trains from Brussels, Paris and other destinations. Trains from those two capitals are more likely to arrive in the early stages of the development but they may well come from further afield in due course. The fact that through trains will arrive from several different destinations poses practical problems. For example, my hon. Friend the Member for Dartford (Mr. Dunn) spoke about carriers' liability, and I shall come to that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Mr. Jessel) asked a pithy and pertinent question. Let us suppose that a super rat has worked out the problem of the electrified grid, discovered that it cannot get its teeth through the deep fence or its concrete footings and decides to venture on to the line. The peril that it faces is trains. It will have to be one heck of a sprinter and will need an extraordnary sense of balance to stay on the track and reach the other end before it is overtaken or met head on by a train.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jessel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will hop off.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may do so but if its heart survives that experience it will encounter similar problems at the other end. Although that is possible in theory, I understand that the electric grid is designed to prevent that as far as possible. There are also strict poisoning regimes, so the chances are that a super rat will perish if it feels hungry along the way. Above all, a rat on the rails will have to watch out for trains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham very seriously, but the chance of any creature getting through, rabid or otherwise, is slender. I am told that the air shock of a train moving at 80 mph through the tunnel would kill a rat. Super rat is up against it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to detain hon. Members for longer than is necessary, so I shall turn to some of the other issues raised. My hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Fry) referred to passenger lists. I shall write to him about both his points—the detention of passengers when a train stops for any reason and passenger lists. It may help if I say that the order enables an immigration officer to require a train manager of a through train to provide a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
passenger list, just as he may require captains of aircraft or ships to do. That power is not invoked routinely, but it is desirable for operational reasons, such as the clearance of tour groups. In the tunnels, passenger lists may also be useful to facilitate the swift clearance of charter services which may in due course operate through the tunnel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To amplify my earlier answer about the detention of passengers, the modification of paragraph 26 of schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971 reflects the provisions that currently apply to ships and aircraft. The law regulates the method of entry of commercial transportation systems bringing passengers to the United Kingdom. Ships and aircraft entering the United Kingdom from outside the common travel area may generally make their first call only at ports of entry. That principle is being extended to international train services passing through the tunnel. They may therefore stop for the purpose of enabling passengers to alight only at terminal control points, for example Waterloo or Ashford. I shall seek to amplify that answer for the convenience of my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dartford (Mr. Dunn) talked about the application of immigration controls. Earlier, I sought to explain that the provisions of the Immigration Act 1971 will apply. The purpose of the order is simply to ensure that those provisions apply with proper and full affect to passengers using the tunnel. There will be no variation in those controls. Indeed, as my hon. Friend and other hon. Members know, the Asylum Bill will shortly reach the statute book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions of that Act, as it will then be, will also apply in exactly the same way. There is no intention whatever of varying our firm but fair immigration controls. If someone applies for asylum on a through train or at Coquelles on the shuttle service, that asylum applicant will be taken to the United Kingdom and considered with the usual dispatch under the provisions of the Asylum Bill. Such an applicant would by definition be a safe third country case because he or she would have been in France when he or she first went through the controls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth and my hon. Friend the Member for Dartford were interested in cost. They asked who will pay for policing? The Channel Tunnel Act 1987 obliges Eurotunnel to pay the Kent police authority for the policing of the British part of the system and since 1 January 1993 Eurotunnel has contributed to the law and order policing costs of the channel tunnel. I understand that the authorised establishment of the Kent constabulary from 1 January 1994 will be 3,140 officers, which will include 142 posts approved during the past five years specifically for the channel tunnel. The Metropolitan police will perform policing and frontier control functions on through trains and at the London stations. To do that, they will provide 109 officers from existing resources—mainly officers released from operational duties through the civilianisation programme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understood the Minister to say that the officers required will have to be found by the Metropolitan police from within savings resulting from civilianisation, rather than from additional provision made by the Government. Is the Minister satisfied with that arrangement? Surely that will mean that fewer officers will be available to the Metropolitan police to meet its
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0769">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
responsibilities. In placing those additional responsibilities on the Metropolitan police, do not the Government have an obligation to provide the appropriate resources?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am absolutely satisfied with the arrangements. Agreement has been reached with the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis to release additional officers through the processes of civilianisation. The recently appointed Commissioner announced his intention of finding additional officers—although they will not be used for policing the tunnel—from within the administrative framework of the Metropolitan police so that they can be released for beat duties. The Commissioner will not be under the pressure that the hon. Gentleman fears.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that agreement had been reached, but there is more than one sort of agreement. Does he mean that the Commissioner is happy and enthusiastic about what sounds like the theft of a considerable number of officers from his force? The problem of crime in this country is very great, and has been debated three times in the past week on the Floor of the House. There has been a 121 per cent, increase in the burden of reported crime. Has what is effectively a cut in establishment been accepted with enthusiasm by the Metropolitan police?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that you, Dr. Blackburn, would rule me out of order if I were to follow the hon. Gentleman down that line of argument and begin to talk about the success of Operation Bumblebee. I shall not do that. I cannot speculate on the weekly or hourly mood of the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis, but I can tell the hon. Gentleman that the Commissioner has already made plans to release additional officers in the way that I have described. If the Commissioner feels that he needs more staff, I have no doubt that he will make a case for increased establishment. That will be considered in the usual way, but I am not persuaded that such an increase is justified. I give way to the hon. Member for Nottingham, North, who I know has London interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Heppell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have London interests, but in this instance I wish to speak up for the Metropolitan police. It is no use the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis asking for extra police in the usual way. Every chief constable in the country may ask for extra staff in that way, but in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, for instance, civilianisation has allowed extra policemen to be put on the beat. The Minister implies that in the Metropolitan police, any extra staff found through civilianisation will be syphoned off for the policing of the channel tunnel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Member for Nottingham, East (Mr. Heppell). My formerly hazy Nottingham geography is now more accurate. What the hon. Gentleman says is not the case, first because the civilianisation process in the Metropolitan police has already freed up more staff than the number that I have mentioned, and secondly because we are at an interesting point in the argument about police resources. I do not wish to stray out of order, Dr. Blackburn, but the police White Paper was published only this week. One of its key

elements is the intention to stop the old procedure under which bids for resources had to be expressed in terms of the number of police posts—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister is straying into matters of the police budget that are out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand you strictures, Dr. Blackburn. It is a subject on which I can enthuse but I shall not do so because you tell me that I am straying out of order. I hope that the subject of security will be in order, as both my hon. Friend the Member for Dartford and the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth raised that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Responsibility for security for the channel tunnel rests, as for all other modes of public transport, with the Secretary of State for Transport. He will introduce a further order in respect of security under section 11 of the Channel Tunnel Act 1987 after the summer recess. As a result of my right hon. Friend's initiatives, that measure will be in place later. That, too, will be the subject of the resolution process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth said that he suspected that we agreed about the way in which the complexities of the order came to pass and about the confusion that he felt that they might cause. I disagree. Section 11 of the 1987 Act provides for implementing the international arrangements between France and Great Britain, and the protocol that followed the Act was not signed until 1991. The 1987 Act provides for statutory instruments to be laid in the same way as today's order. It therefore follows the usual procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister misses the point. I am not, of course, suggesting that he does so deliberately. I understand that it was originally intended that the issues covered in the order would be part of primary legislation but that they were withdrawn because the agreements to which the Minister referred would not be arrived at in time for consistent legislation to be enacted, and that is why arrangements were made to use the statutory instrument procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was talking not of the danger of confusion, but of the lack of scrutiny and proper examination which, though understandable, would put the Committee in great difficulty in its attempts to do its job properly. If complex subsidiary legislation is rushed, there is always a danger that matters that should not be overlooked will be. That is the position today. I do not suggest that we are pursuing improper procedures in Committee. You Dr. Blackburn, would ensure that we did not. I am suggesting that we may not have adequate time for full scrutiny of such a complex statutory instrument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, that is not so. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman to confirm my point and enlarge upon it if necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the hon. Gentleman's circumstances here are difficult in that he agreed to attend the Committee at short notice. I commend his approach to the subject. Members of the Committee have been able to go to the Vote Office and collect the draft order and other relevant documentation, so it is available. Nothing about the order, or this debate, seeks to skimp over the detail. All that I sought to warn the Committee at the outset was that this was a complex issue with many details being addressed. I intended to cover in outline as many of those details as I could in my opening speech. There is nothing peculiar to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0770">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
the circumstances of the order that puts it at variance with the usual practice of the House of Commons. The 1987 Act provided for statutory instruments to be laid in the usual manner. As a result of advice that has wafted towards me, I am prompted to add that it was made clear that controversial matters, or matters of public or parliamentary interest, would be debated under the affirmative resolution procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may now be allowed to turn to the important subject of fire and emergencies. The treaty of Canterbury requires the chairman of the safety authority, or his agent, to take, in an emergency, the measures that are necessary for the safety of persons and property within the fixed link. The chief officers of the emergency services in Kent and the préfet of the Pas-de-Calais have been appointed as the chairman's agents for this purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked whether the additional costs have been provided for the Kent fire brigade. Eurotunnel has largely met Kent fire brigade's additional costs for personnel, training and specialist equipment, amounting to some £923,000, up to the opening of the tunnel. Eurotunnel will meet the costs of the additional training of 53 extra firefighters who will be seconded to the new Eurotunnel fire station at a cost of £300,000. It will also meet the annual running costs of the station of £1,400,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of responsibility for safety in the tunnel was raised. The bi-national channel tunnel safety authority which will advise the intergovernmental commission is resonsible for ensuring that all appropriate national and international safety requirements are met. In addition, national safety agencies and authorities retain their responsibilities up to the frontier and in the middle of the tunnel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I explained at the outset that the powers of the French police in the United Kingdom relate only to frontier control purposes within the control zone, and, within the zone, to the area that I described—from the booth along the road to the departure platform. Law and order generally in Cheriton is the responsibility of the United Kingdom police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Constables under the control and direction of the chief constable of Kent are responsible for policing the United Kingdom part of the tunnel system. While working on English territory, whether at Cheriton, in the tunnels up to the frontier, or on board the shuttle trains, they have available all their usual powers as police officers. While working in the control zone on French territory—at Coquelles—their role is more restricted, as the role of their French counterparts will be at Cheriton. Their primary function in the control zone will be to carry out frontier controls, principally to enforce prevention of terrorism legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within the control zone in England, French data protection law will apply to data used by French officers in the exercise of their functions. Similarly, United Kingdom data protection law will apply in the control zone in France to data so used by British officers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth asked about firearms. I tried earlier to describe the restricted conditions in which French police officers and French customs officers could carry their firearms. As I said, we have to recognise that it is customary for French officers to be armed while on duty. The protocol provides that officers will be able to act in the area of the juxtaposed controls as though they were in their own territory. That has resulted in our agreeing to a small number of officers,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
no more than four—two police and two Customs officers—doing so at Cheriton. If there was a misuse of firearms, those officers would be answerable under British law in United Kingdom courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn briefly, for emphasis, to the Carriers Liability Act 1987. We considered applying that Act because we regard it as an important check on the documents of passengers travelling to this country before they depart for it. But, after considering the practicalities of the shuttle trains and the through trains, we decided that it would not be realistic to apply the 1987 Act. That is not to say that the provisions of the Immigration Act 1971 and of the Asylum Bill, when it is enacted, will not apply. They will, in all cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I come to the subject of ethnic minorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the Minister is having to rush through the many questions that have been raised—he has a fast pace. He should give the Committee a full explanation, as I suggested earlier, by writing to members of the Committee about those matters that he cannot cover adequately today, a copy being placed in the Library, as you so helpfully suggested earlier, Dr. Blackburn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Earlier, I undertook to sift through the report of the Committee's proceedings, and to answer in letter form those matters that require amplification. I shall certainly do that on the provisions of the 1987 Act and on our decision not to apply those provisions to the shuttle and through trains operating in the tunnel. Although I have spoken on that subject twice, we have a little time at our disposal so I shall now add to my remarks—none the less, recording what I say later to ensure that my answer is as thorough as the Committee would hope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not believe that the effectiveness of immigration control will be significantly reduced. As I said, carriers' liability procedure is used not only in the United Kingdom but in most European countries and member states of the European Community. The EC has made it clear that if there is no carriers' liability the provisions will be used, as they are in north America and Australia; it is a widely used and sensible control to check documents. In those circumstances, it will not be practical or realistic to use such controls, but that does not mean that our own controls will be significantly reduced. The control is made effective by a number of different measures. I have alluded to the Immigration Act 1971; that Act applies, as will the Asylum Act. Our immigration controls will be in place, with checks being made on the through trains or, if there is a large crowd and it is difficult to make that check, at Waterloo—or at Coquelles for the shuttle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth spoke about ethnic minorities. So far as British immigration controls and the work of the other authorities is concerned, I assure the hon. Gentleman that no distinction will be drawn on any ethnic basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In passing, I now recall another matter raised by the hon. Member. He asked whether other Government Departments worked closely with the Home Office in the preparation of the background information for our debate. All those Departments whose responsibilities are touched on by the order have co-operated; if we were able to carry out a scrutiny of those sitting in the Public Gallery, we might find other Departments represented,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0771">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
including the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and Customs and Excise. I assure the hon. Gentleman that there has been full co-operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman alluded to the French controls. Those are a matter for the French authorities. The hon. Gentleman will know from our debates on the Asylum Bill on the Floor of the House and from what his hon. Friends heard in Committee, that this country has high standards. A strengthened complaints procedure has been set up. I have no doubt that French officers, too, aspire to the highest possible standards. If their behaviour gives rise to complaints, that will be a matter for the French
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
authorities. I hope that I have covered all the points—or as many of them as I see in my notes. I once again commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dr. Blackburn. In view of the sensitive nature of these matters, I feel that it is appropriate to place on record that I am a shareholder of Eurotunnel. I do not know whether that is relevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
