Value Added Tax (Beverages) Order 1993</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Paymaster General (Sir John Cope)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Value Added Tax (Beverages) Order 1993 (S.I. 1993, No. 2498).</p></blockquote>
I would like first to explain the background to this order. Hon. Members know that it is necessary for the Treasury to patrol the boundaries of every tax. We must take account of changes in the marketplace and business practice. Taxpayers, not unreasonably, constantly try to test the boundaries of the law with us and the courts to seek advantage for their businesses. I do not complain about that—I am a chartered accountant after all—but it means that the Treasury, Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue sometimes need to protect the revenue. That is what we are doing today.<br><br>
The order covers fruit juices, which have been subject to VAT since 1974 and to purchase tax before that; but several things have happened since then. Approximately eight years ago a new product began to emerge—mass-produced freshly squeezed orange juice. This is now produced in very modern plants on a substantial scale, but the juice is untreated and as such has not been classed as a "manufactured beverage", which are the relevent words in the statute, so it has not been subject to VAT. That has led to complaints, particularly from apple juice producers, that VAT is unfair on them. They point out among other things that they use a lot of home-produced fruit whereas all orange juice comes from imported fruit.<br><br>
Meanwhile some producers of orange juice which is pasteurised but not otherwise treated appealed to VAT tribunals that their juice was not manufactured within the meaning of the law and said they should not have to pay VAT. In the first such case—that of Sunjuice Limited—a tribunal decided that the juice was manufactured, but in a second case another tribunal decided that it was not manufactured. Both cases have now been appealed to the High Court as to the meaning of the 1974 legislation concerning a product that was not at that time on the market.<br><br>
I should make it clear that if the order is accepted today, that case will still be relevant to the tax paid up to date.<br><br>
It is obvious that the present position with regard to pasteurised juice is most unsatisfactory, both for us and the trade, which does not know whether to charge tax. I understand that the case could take two years if, as is possible, it goes all the way to the House of Lords. When it is over, we would still have to decide whether the 1974 law, as settled by the court, left a satisfactory and fair dividing line. It therefore seems best to end the uncertainty and decide the matter for the future now. The court case is still relevant to the tax paid to date, which is likely to be some millions of pounds.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
The question remains, "What is a fair dividing line?" If one looks at the supermarket shelves to try to settle a fair and satisfactory dividing line between different sorts of fruit juice, my judgment is that it is right to tax them all. The majority are taxed now and have been for a long time. It is the more expensive products that are VAT-free at the moment.<br><br>
I do not think that the difference between pasteurisation and other treatment is a satisfactory dividing line. Nor do I think that the sector of the industry producing fresh juice—untreated except for the packaging process—and now with sales of about £50 million should be treated differently from the rest, with total sales of about £1 billion a year. The order provides that all fruit juices will be treated the same for VAT. I commend it to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>10.35 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Oxford, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Paymaster General said that it was the job of the Treasury, Customs and Excise and the Government to patrol the boundaries of every tax. I thought that they were extending the boundaries of almost every tax. Barely a week passes without the Government doing something wicked to increase the imposition of taxation and extend the burden of VAT. I am worried both about the procedure that is being followed and about the content of the order.<br><br>
I have received representations from several bodies in the industry: the Food and Drink Federation, the Soft Drinks Consortium and the British Retail Consortium. I shall quote from the letter I received from Mr. Simon Nayyar of the Westminster Communication group, writing on behalf of several companies—Johnson's Fresh Products Limited, Orchard House Foods Limited, St. Ivel Chilled Products Limited, Sunjuice Limited and Sunripe Limited—<i>[Interruption.]</i> Conservative Members seem to find what I am saying amusing. It is certainly not amusing to the companies affected because, as the letter states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The UK freshly squeezed juice industry, whose retail value is £50 million, believes that this Order, were it to be implemented in its current form, would cripple its business. The industry, which began in the mid-1980s, is the world leader in this market. It is highly competitive in the international marketplace, despite having to bear importation costs for fruit … Its product quality is unrivalled. It operates to hygiene and production standards that are significantly higher than other international producers'. The industry is cost-efficient (price per litre, in real terms, has fallen steadily since the 1980s), it is profitable, it provides significant direct and indirect employment opportunities within the UK and it has tremendous export potential within the Community and elsewhere."</p></blockquote>
Mr. Nayyar points out that, if the order is implemented, in addition to damaging the strong market that these firms have built up, there will be an almost immediate loss of 530 jobs in the industry and 1,500 contractors' jobs will also be put at risk. The organisations foresee as much as £1 million in corporation tax receipts being lost to the Exchequer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Pawsey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rugby and Kenilworth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman say on what basis the industry has worked out those job losses? Will he also help me by saying what the new cost of a pint of fresh orange juice will be following the imposition of VAT?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not have all the details of the calculations that form the basis of those estimates; but, knowing their business, the companies concerned will have made a good estimate of the price elasticity of demand for their product.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0435">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will allow me to answer his first intervention, I shall gladly give way again. Those organisations know their market and know what the likely effect of the imposition of VAT will be on sales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman has not had an opportunity to do his homework as thoroughly on this matter as on other subjects, would he agree with me that the situation might be gently exaggerated? I would be more persuaded if he could tell us the basis on which the figures were calculated.<br><br>
Before I became a Member of Parliament in 1979, I was a managing director of a group. In a similar situation, I might have been tempted to gild the lily. I wonder whether that is the case here. I am not suggesting that it is; I am merely seeking advice. As the hon. Gentleman is developing his case, it would be helpful if he could provide that information.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is suggesting that the lily is being gilded. That is a slur on the firms which gave the information to me and to other members of the Committee. The calculations would have been made on the basis of price elasticity of demand for the product. As a former managing director, the hon. Gentleman will know that any successful firm has a good understanding of the way in which its market is likely to react to price change.<br><br>
There is certainly an element of estimation of a price change. The results might be even worse than the industry predicts. The substantial point is that the order and the imposition of VAT on those products puts jobs, successful businesses and corporation tax receipts at risk.<br><br>
I am also concerned about the procedure which we are following. Several representations have stated that the industry was not consulted. Can the Paymaster General tell us whether the industry was consulted, what form that took, what response the Government received and what answers they can give?<br><br>
The order is yet a further erosion of the zero rate of VAT. I fear that the way in which VAT is being applied to what is undoubtedly a natural food will set an unfortunate precedent. Will the Paymaster General give assurances that it is not the Government's intention to apply the same procedure to other pressed liquids which are at present zero rated? As he is busy, in his words, patrolling the boundaries of the tax—in my words, extending the boundaries of the tax—what candidates are on the horizon for VAT changes? That should worry us all.<br><br>
The Paymaster General referred in his letter to me about the order, and in his opening remarks, to the desirability of achieving similar treatment for all fruit juices so that similar products are treated the same way for VAT purposes. Another way of achieving equality of treatment would be to bring all the drinks into the category of zero rating. The Paymaster General should explain why, whenever the Government are confronted by anomalies and difficulties, they always instinctively react by extending taxes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I again gently probe the hon. Gentleman's knowledge of the subject by asking—he may have had an opportunity to consider the matter in more detail than I—what the revenue implications would be if VAT were added to other fresh juices?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Given that Customs and Excise are not at the Opposition's disposal to estimate the receipts, I happily refer the hon. Gentleman's question to the Paymaster General who, I am sure, will have the information at his fingertips. The right hon. Gentleman will be only too pleased to tell his hon. Friend how much extra revenue the Government intend to pull in by extending VAT.<br><br>
There is another aspect to this matter. The Paymaster General referred to the products that we are discussing as being sold at a higher price than similar products—I think that he said that they were relatively expensive. It is, however, precisely because natural foods have an ever-increasing market appeal that the share of the market commanded by such companies and their products has been increasing. One of the reasons for that is, of course, that natural pressed fruit juice is a healthy item to be drinking, so the imposition of VAT is additionally undesirable—it is an imposition on a natural product with health benefits.<br><br>
The Paymaster General presented the order as innocuous; in fact, it presents major problems for the industry. It will undoubtedly destroy jobs and it represents a further attack by the Government on the zero rating of food. The Paymaster General asked, somewhat rhetorically, "What is a fair judgment on this matter?" I say that a fair judgment is that this order should be rejected.</span></p>
<p>10.45</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Henry Bellingham <span class='memberconstituency'>(Norfolk, North-West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I represent a constituency where there is a considerable amount of food manufacturing. There is one company in my consistuency which manufactures fruit juices. Furthermore, in west Norfolk, there are several food equipment manufacturers, and throughout East Anglia probably at least half a dozen companies involved in manufacturing fruit juices would be affected by the order.<br><br>
I have several questions for my right hon. Friend the Minister. Why is the order being rushed through? Why the lack of consultation? I am particularly angry because I am a parliamentary private secretary and on the pay roll, and I would have thought that the least he could have done would have been to consult Members of Parliament who might be affected by the order—those who have factories and businesses in their constituencies or nearby. It is particularly odd not to have had any consultation at all with the industry. The order is important and will have an impact on several businesses.<br><br>
I do not know whether the figures mentioned by Mr. Nayyar and by other companies such as Tropicana (Europe) who have written to us are correct but, either way, the amount of money that the order will bring in is very small. Against VAT, one must set off the loss of corporation tax receipts. If there are any redundancies at all on any significant scale, and even if we discount the figure given in the letter to the hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) by 50 per cent. £5 million in receipts will be completely wiped out, and a cost to Her Majesty's Government will probably be added to that. I should have thought that the Government would want to avoid that, particularly at the moment.<br><br>
There is another point: my right hon. Friend the Minister asked where to draw the dividing line. I understand that that was the subject of much debate in the VAT tribunal. I should have thought that is was very simple: either the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0436">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
juices have additives or they do not; either they are natural products or they are not. I should not have thought that it needed a scientist of great repute to work that one out.<br><br>
The order penalises healthy drinking and healthy products. We all know, from the many articles that have been written, about the effect that additives can have in juices and other drinks as well as other food products. There has recently been a tremendous emphasis on trying to produce natural foods and natural drinks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with the case being developed by my hon. Friend. Indeed, as a regular drinker of the juice. I certainly believe that it is healthy, as well as flavoursome, and an excellent drink. However, this is a new industry. It is clearly a lively, thriving industry which has developed a new market. We heard from the hon. Member for Oxford, East that the market is expanding considerably. Given all that, does my hon. Friend really believe that serious damage would be done to the industry?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bellingham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. I do not know the answer, but it would have been sensible to have had a consultation period, instead of giving the industry only two days warning and letting it read about the measure in the newspaper when the order was laid before Parliament. Representatives of the industry should at least have been consulted.<br><br>
We are discussing an important industry. My hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Mr. Pawsey) may not have a beverage firm in his constituency, but we all know that the recovery, although real, is nevertheless fragile. We do not want successful employers who have invested heavily suddenly to have to start laying people off and seeing the growth in their businesses curtailed.<br><br>
In a way, we are penalising success. The matter ended up in the VAT tribunal because several companies had been extremely successful, which led to other businesses that produced non-fresh juices and other beverages challenging their status. I shall repeat the point made by the hon. Member for Oxford, East. The matter was on its way through the judicial system; it had been through the VAT tribunal and was en route to the High Court. Surely that was the time when such debates should have taken place. Why did the Treasury launch a pre-emptive strike, without consultation and without bringing into that process Back Benchers who have beverage firms in their constituencies? I should be grateful if my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General answered my questions.</span></p>
<p>10.51 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir John Cope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Several points have been made—by the hon. Member for Oxford, East, by my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, North-West (Mr. Bellingham) and by my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth. The first concerned consultation and the procedure that the Government have followed. I have seen the letters that have been circulated by various parties and to which the hon. Member for Oxford, East referred. I know of the criticisms that they contained, repeated today in Committee.<br><br>
The conflicting tribunal decisions issue has been around for some time, as have the complaints from apple juice producers, in particular, and others about the status of their product compared with the status of fresh orange juice
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
products—an issue that has received much attention this morning. Hon. Members know very well that the Treasury does not consult before putting tax proposals of this type before the House. Once we had decided what we wished to do, given the approach of the Budget, we could have tucked away the proposal in the Budget itself.<br><br>
We preferred, however, to introduce it to the House separately and thus to end the uncertainty. It was quite proper to put the matter first to the House by laying the order on the day the House came back after the recess, and to debate it today. The measure will come into effect at midnight on Budget day, which is an appropriate time.<br><br>
It is always a dilemma for Ministers, not least those concerned with tax matters, to decide on the extent of consultation and to ensure that the House is treated properly when introducing proposals, and I have explained the route that we have chosen for this measure. Since the order was laid before Parliament, I have discussed it with representatives of the companies to which the hon. Member for Oxford, East referred. Naturally, we have received written representations from those industries and others, too.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman makes the case that slipping the measure in as an order and giving us short notice of it—and the industry even less notice—is preferable to including it in a Budget speech on the Floor of the House and thus subjecting it to the full rigours of a Finance Bill debate. There would have been more public scrutiny and longer for the industry to contemplate the consequences of the measure if it had been introduced, as it should have been, in the Budget. The reason why the Government did not take that course of action is because they wanted to give the industry and the public the minimum opportunity to react against the measure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir John Cope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The measure would not have been in the Finance Bill. It would have been an order and would have come to this type of Committee, because that is the nature of the legislative process for such matters. The sole question is whether it would have been better to announce it in the Budget in the middle of other measures which I am not going to discuss today.<br><br>
Other points have been raised—especially the effects of the order on the fresh orange juice sector of the market. The effect on jobs is extremely difficult to gauge. The firms concerned have made estimates in, I am sure, good faith. They did their best to make their case. However, it is not only the effect on the producers of the juice that should be considered, but the effect on other firms producing competing products which, at present, are at a taxation disadvantage vis-à-vis the producers of fresh juice. If we had not acted, the pasteurised juice producers would have improved their position if the second VAT tribunal decision had stuck, or not if the first had stuck. Pasteurised juice producers have a very large share of the market. We have to consider the effect both on revenue and on the industry.<br><br>
It is difficult to foresee the exact effect of such a change on concerned parties. I shall not be drawn into makeing a forecast because, apart from anything else, the outcome depends on the manufacturers' decisions as well as those of the consumer.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0437">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the right hon. Gentleman saying that he does not have an estimate of the effects of this order on the Treasury's revenue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir John Cope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have made various calculations and have seen those of the manufacturers. None are reliable enough to give a forecast to the Committee at this stage. It will be difficult even to gauge the full effects in retrospect when we know what the manufacturers' and consumers' decisions turn out to be.<br><br>
The health value of the products was also mentioned. That depends primarily on the vitamin C content, which varies between products. Indeed, freshly squeezed unpasteurised orange juice has a vitamin C content similar to many juices that are treated in other ways, such as to give them a long life. The vitamin C content is important, but is not solely an advantage of the freshly squeezed product.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty <span class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister tell the Committee the retail cost of fresh orange juice? Is he aware of how expensive it is, even in a supermarket?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir John Cope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It costs about £1.89 a litre. Obviously, that varies from supermarket to supermarket. It is at the higher end of the price range for similar juices, both orange and others, and is therefore, one of the more expensive products.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister have an opinion on the fact that it is often important for a young, growing family to be persuaded to drink pure orange juice instead of fizzy liquids? Has he considered the effect of the increased price that the order will entail?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir John Cope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Other orange juices are available with equal vitamin C content. They are not fizzy, but they are treated to provide a longer shelf life—and they are much cheaper. They are much drunk by the families to which the hon. Gentleman referred.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth asked why all fruit juices could not be relieved of VAT instead of extending the tax to freshly squeezed orange

juice, which is only a small sector of the industry. It has a turnover of approximately £50 million in a fruit juice industry with a total turnover of £1,000 million. If all fruit juices were relieved of VAT, the revenue cost would be approximately £155 million, which we would have to find elsewhere—and that would not be easy. The tax has applied to most fruit juices for many years and I believe that our decision to impose VAT on freshly squeezed juice is correct.</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am unconvinced by the Paymaster General's response. He has not demonstrated that there has been proper consultation and he has not persuaded me that the interests of the industry have been taken into account. I am sure that the Committee is disturbed at the erosion of the zero rating of food. In the interests of fairness and jobs in the industry and to preserve the principle that food should not be subject to VAT, we shall press the matter to a Division.</span></p>
