	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft British Alcan Primary and Recycling Ltd (Rateable Values) (Scotland) Order 1992.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the agreement of the Committee, it will be convenient to debate also the draft British Gas plc.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of the entire Committee, may I first say, Mr. Hogg, what a pleasure it is to see you again chairing a Committee on a statutory instrument. I believe that this is the first such Committee of this Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> Some of us served on one yesterday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the first that I have attended in this Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 12 orders under consideration relate to the valuation of non-domestic property. They prescribe the levels of rateable value to apply to the so-called formula valued industries, as from 1 April 1992, and relate to the valuation of certain public utilities. They prescribe either the rateable values, or the rules to be used in determining the rateable values for this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The orders update the prescribed rateable value for each industry for last year, to take account of material changes in circumstances and the revised level of industrial derating. The updated rateable values are reapportioned among rating areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton)—in case this is one of the questions that he intends to ask me—that the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, Scottish Assessors' Association, and the undertakings themselves have been fully consulted on the orders and are content with them. On that basis, I commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
	<p>4.32 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I, Mr. Hogg—for the second time in this Parliament—congratulate you on being Chairman. I am slightly surprised that the Minister did not thank me on behalf of his colleagues for not saying no when you, Mr. Hogg, invited the Committee to consider the orders together. Otherwise, we would have sat for one and a half hours on each order. The temptation was powerful, but I am not a member of "Scotland United" and so not in favour of the destruction of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister owes the Committee some explanation. Hon. Members who bothered to read the orders will have seen that each of them ends with a revocation. For example, the water undertakings order states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Water Undertakings (Rateable Values) (Scotland) Order 1990(a) and the Water Undertakings (Rateable Values) (Scotland) Order 1991(b) are hereby revoked."</p></blockquote>
Every year, this group of Members of Parliament meets to discuss these and similar orders. It seems to me—and, I am sure, to the Minister—that that is a silly undertaking for Members of Parliament, whose time would be better spent elsewhere. The hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. Dykes) is looking at his watch, thinking that I am right. Most of us would prefer to be doing other things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why on earth do we come back year in, year out, to discuss these orders. I accept that the normal rateable values do not apply to pipes, underground railways, and underground and overhead cabling—and that therefore normal rates are not paid. Surely the Minister could come to some arrangement with the organisations concerned, and find a better way of dealing with the matter than this traditional annual event.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The water undertakings order is in some ways the most ridiculous of all. Members from English constituencies may not know it, but water in Scotland is still a local government responsibility. As yet, although there are threats, the water industry in Scotland had not been privatised. Orkney Island council will pay £130,961 in rateable value on its water pipes and so on. To whom will it pay that money? to Orkney Island council. It is absurd that there has to be an order for Members of Parliament to coinsider for an island council to pay itself £130,000. Presumably transferring that money will cost something.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The £14 million in rates that is paid to a variety of district councils by Strathclyde regional council is taken back by Strathclyde regional council from the ratepayers in those district councils through the water rate. It would be much better to arrange for no transfer, for there to be no charge imposed on ratepayers in those local authories. The whole operation is absurd. Perhaps the Minister agrees, and we can pass on to something more useful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.37 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would go so far as to agree with the hon. Gentleman's description of the operation as "absurd", but I sympathise with his comments. On behalf of my colleagues, I express gratitude to the hon. Gentleman for not dividing the Committee and forcing what could have been 12 one-and-a-half-hour debates on the orders. It is completely irrelevant that my car is going to the airport for either the 8.15 pm shuttle or the 9 o'clock British Midland flight to Glasgow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there had been a flight at 6.15 pm, I would not have spoken at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0235">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister and the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) should not debate their travel arrangements. They should stick to the orders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take your admonition seriously, Mr. Hogg, but no doubt you to heard what I said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's point has substance. I agree that the prescription of rateable values is not an ideal means of assessment, and the industries involved share that view. For example, they do not have a right of appeal. We proposed to them that the matter should be dealt with under the planned 1995 conventional revaluation. We are preparing for that, and exploratory meetings have already been held between my officials and representatives of the electricity supply industry and the dock and harbour authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the process is unsatisfactory, and we will resolve the matter at the next revaluation in 1995. When that is done, there will be no need for this annual meeting to consider the orders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
