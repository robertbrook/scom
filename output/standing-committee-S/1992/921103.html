	<div class='legislation'>Draft European Communities (Definition of Treaties) (Europe Agreement Establishing an Association Between the European Communities and their Member States and the Republic of Hungary) Order 1992</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Mr. Tristan Garel-Jones)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft European Communities (Definition of Treaties) (Europe Agreement Establishing an Association between the European Communities and their Member States and the Republic of Hungary) Order 1992.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the agreement of the Committee, it will be convenient to discuss the other order before us, namely, the draft European Communities (Definition of Treaties) (Europe Agreement Establishing an Association between the European Communities and their Member States and the Republic of Poland) Order 1992.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Garel-Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the United Kingdom can ratify these agreements, they need to be specified under section 1(3) of the European Communities Act 1972. That is why we are having this debate today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we last debated the agreements on 17 February, the House welcomed them and looked forward to then-early ratification. Unfortunately, the process of ratification both by member states and the European Parliament has not been as speedy as we had hoped, primarily because of the time which elapsed before final versions of the texts in all Community languages were made available in Brussels. The European Parliament gave its assent to the agreements in September. Since association agreements with the countries of eastern Europe were a British initiative, it is appropriate, I hope that the Committee will agree, that the United Kingdom should be among the first to ratify them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I get this clear? Is the Minister saying that when the order goes through, the agreements will be ratified in the normal way? In other words, they will not come before Parliament again, but will simply be signed under the Ponsonby rules and will therefore be ratified. Can the Minister assure the Committee that we might yet have another opportunity to discuss the agreements, or is this the last that we will see of them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Garel-Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the hon. Gentleman is right. This will be the last opportunity that the House has, through this Committee, to look at these matters because, as he rightly says, this is an international treaty and therefore would thereafter proceed under the Ponsonby rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The association agreements are mixed competence agreements. Those elements which fall under Community competence—primarily the trade liberalisation measures—were brought into effect earlier this year under so-called
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
interim agreements, which were scrutinised with the main agreements in December and January, and debated on 17 February. Since it is unlikely that the main agreements will have been ratified by all parties in time for them to come into effect on 1 January 1993, the interim agreements, which are due to expire on 31 December, will be extended until such time as the main agreements come into force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members may wonder why we have not submitted a draft order specifying the European Community association agreement with Czechoslovakia as well. I hope that they will find the explanation simple and convincing. The European Parliament has declined to consider the agreement. Ratification cannot therefore be completed in time for the agreement to come into force before the dissolution of the Czechoslovak federation on 1 January 1993.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be difficult to proceed with agreements with the two new republics until one knew—or, indeed, knows—the terms on which the separation will take place. Assuming that that takes place smoothly on 1 January, the Community will need to establish arrangements with both new republics; that is likely to be done through similar individual agreements. Hon. Members will have an opportunity to scrutinise any such agreements at a later date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a long haul to overcome the artificial division of Europe into east and west that was maintained for 40 years. New links have had to be and are being developed and encouraged. The Council of Europe, the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, NATO—through the new North Atlantic Co-operation Council—and the European bank for reconstruction and development all have their different parts to play in the process of returning eastern Europe to the mainstream of our world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the EC has a pivotal role, not least in view of the fact that most central and east European countries see membership of the Community as a priority. The association agreements—or, as they are technically known, the Europe agreements—are the basic fink between the EC and those countries. They anchor them to the Community by providing a framework in which relations between the EC and Hungary and Poland will develop. Moreover, they recognise the aspiration of membership and, indeed, are a means by which that can be achieved. Our intention is to interpret them positively and give them real substance so that they can fulfil their prime function of reinforcing political stability and economic growth in Poland and Hungary. The content of the agreements can be considered under five broad headings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first and most important element is trade liberalisation. Those provisions are already in force. The agreements envisage the gradual establishment of a GATT compatible free trade area over a maximum 10-year transitional period. They allow for the asymmetric lowering of trade barriers: the EC will reduce its barriers more quickly than Poland and Hungary. It is vital for those countries to have increased access to the large EC market as quickly as possible as they restructure their economies. The agreements also provide for a substantial measure of trade liberalisation in agriculture, which is the area in which Poland and Hungary are most likely to become competitive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the short term, the beneficial effects of the agreements are weighted in favour of Poland and Hungary. That is right, but, to the extent that member states need to make
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0650">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
sacrifices, we have argued successfully that the burden must be shared equitably among us. Comprehensive GATT-type safeguards and anti-dumping provisions have been included. They can be applied to all products if that is necessary to counteract unfair or damaging imports. We firmly believe that improved trade access and foreign direct investment are more effective ways in which to assist economic reform than aid. But we also believe that trade should be fair, and are prepared to support EC action when dumped or subsidised imports can be shown to seriously injure domestic industry. In the longer term, Poland and Hungary are committed to removing their subsidies and harmonising to EC standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second element is economic co-operation. The aim of that is to help Poland and Hungary to build up the political and economic structures of a modern state. The heading covers a wide range of sectors, from education and training to information technology and telecommunications; from industry and investment protection to financial services and monetary policy; from agriculture and the environment to energy and nuclear safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third heading concerns the approximation of laws and standards. If Poland and Hungary want it to, the EC will use its technical assistance programme to help in that area, for example with the drafting of laws. The aim is for Poland and Hungary to bring their legislation closer to that of the EC, both in terms of existing laws and future legislation that they will put in place to meet the needs of market economies. That approach fits in well with their intention to apply for EC membership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fourth aspect is the political dimension. Central and eastern Europeans most want to belong to the EC. To help that long-term ambition and give a foretaste of what membership involves, the agreements will set up association councils which will meet once a year at ministerial level to review and build on those agreements. Those meetings will also be an opportunity for a dialogue on foreign policy co-ordination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the absence of that formal mechanism for dialogue, two informal substitutes for those councils have taken place under our presidency. The first was a meeting of EC Foreign Ministers and their Visegrad three counterparts in Luxembourg on 5 October. As the joint statement which was issued on that occasion made clear, the meeting was a significant development in the process of strengthening dialogue and co-operation between the EC and the Visegrad countries. Last week, the Prime Minister hosted a most successful summit attended by the leaders of the Visegrad countries and President Delors. A joint declaration stressing our commitment to intensify political dialogue at every level was issued, and the meeting itself focused on implementation of the association agreements. It agreed a number of practical initiatives to give substance to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, there is the question of financial arrangements. The agreements themselves are not intended to cover financial assistance. That is handled separately, and the Community's record is good. The Community set up the Phare programme of technical assistance, originally for Poland and Hungary, but now including all of central and eastern Europe. The cumulative commitment to date is approximately £1,600 million. The Community has also led the G24—Group of 24—provision of balance of payments
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
support to countries in the region. Approximately £920 million has already been provided in that respect, and proposals under consideration total nearly—330 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want the Visegrad countries to join the Community as soon as they are able to assume the obligations of membership. As the European Council in Lisbon in June reaffirmed,
	<br><blockquote><p>"co-operation will be focused systematically on assisting their effort to prepare the accession to the Union which they seek".</p></blockquote>
The timing of their accession is up to them, but we aim to give them every possible assistance towards that goal, and the association agreements are the best means of doing that. The agreements are dynamic and designed with an evolutionary clause to allow them to develop. They provide the tools for consolidating democracy and creating liberal market-oriented economies. The United Kingdom took the lead in suggesting the agreements in the first place and in constantly encouraging our Community partners to be as liberal as possible during the negotiations. That is widely recognised and appreciated in Hungary and Poland: it will indeed be appropriate for the United Kingdom to be one of the first to ratify the agreements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.41 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the problems that we face is that the long and somewhat obscure titles of the documents cover a serious and important issue. It is right that we should consider the detail of these large agreements that the Minister has described, but, as I have often said, it is a pity that Parliament does not have a proper opportunity to ratify treaties in the way that other country's Parliaments do. However, given the Government's problems with the ratification of another treaty, the prospect of going through such a process for agreements with Poland, Hungary and, eventually, Czechoslovakia would not fill the Government or their Whips with amusement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I came to the Committee in a hurry after meeting the market committee of the Folketing, the Danish Parliament. It is currently the most famous parliamentary committee in Europe. It is appropriate that we are sitting under a painting entitled "Alfred inciting the Saxons to prevent the landing of the Danes". The significance of that will not be lost on the Minister who, although he has not displayed it this morning, has a good sense of humour. That is why he was the Deputy Chief Whip of his party for so long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the orders—the Europe or association agreements, or whatever title we choose to give them. Even if we divide on other matters in the House in the next 48 hours, there is no disagreement about our enthusiasm for bringing the Visegrad three and the other countries of central and eastern Europe into the broader European family. We hope that the Europe agreement on Czechoslovakia will be approved by the European Parliament soon and brought before our Parliament, although, clearly, there will be problems because Czechoslovakia may no longer be the country it was when the agreement was negotiated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agreements represent a step forward; a small step thwart with problems, but a step forward nevertheless. I am sure that the British Parliament will give them an enthusiastic send-off even if what I am about to say will somewhat militate against that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0651">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
I cannot help noticing the less than packed Benches on my side of the Committee and I am sure that the Government's Foreign Office Whip will be relieved that, for once, the equation is slightly different from that which appears for tomorrow night's vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Davis (Boothferry)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You wish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder who wishes that more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the association agreements, which, despite being welcome, hide major issues. Those issues concern the political implications of these countries' aspirations to become full members of the EC and the economic implications of what the Minister calls trade liberalisation, although it is not as liberal as it appears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agreements refer to those countries' aspirations to become members of the EC, but in terms that seem almost one-sided. The association agreement on Hungary states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Having in mind that the final objective of Hungary is to become a member of the Community and that this association, in view of the Parties, will help to achieve this objective …"</p></blockquote>
That seems somewhat unilateral and one-sided, which, of course, is deliberate. The countries of the EC have decided that they will not jointly subscribe to the objective of full Community membership for Poland and Hungary, although they should. That is a weakness in the agreements, because, although that membership aspiration is recognised and included in them, it does not seem to have the approval of the rest of the EC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we believe—we would be right to do so—that the EC represents a historic example of the way in which previously warring countries can co-operate, integrate and share sovereignty and that its example stands in stark contrast to events in eastern Europe, surely we can grasp this opportunity to show that we support the aspirations of Poland and Hungary to eventual full membership of the Community. I believe that if we did, and if we were explicit in doing so, we could establish targets towards which they could work and which would help them to build their economic and political structures. That development is crucial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The economic provisions of the agreements pose a problem. Trade liberalisation was the slogan with which the Minister launched the association agreements. However, major barriers to trade still exist in them. Indeed, the rigid quotas specified in the agreements for iron, steel, textiles and food—basic commodities for potential exporters—are perhaps tougher than the Minister would have wished and certainly tougher than those countries can bear at the present time. How are they to build their economies and their export markets if we artificially restrict their exports in key areas? I appreciate the sensitivities of western Europe, riven, as it is, by recession. I represent a steelworks constituency in Scotland, so I am especially sensitive to the way in which eastern European countries might export to the detriment of the home industry. But, if we subscribe to the belief that our security is tied up with their economic stability, we cannot place in their way economic barriers that they cannot overcome. That is one of the problems with association agreements. They are not seen as a step in a process, but, perhaps by busy Ministers and extremely busy civil servants, as a landmark; a point in the exhaustion cycle that they have reached. The agreements will stand rigid and nothing will move beyond them because so many other matters are left on the agenda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
I urge the Minister and the Government to advance the process, and to ensure that the quota levels established in the agreement are considered constantly in the timetable envisaged so that we can make sure that those countries have the markets that they need to build their economies. Without that, the democratic transformation of the former communist world will not take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this country, we must recognise—the sooner the better because time is running out—that our security, in the broadest sense imaginable and including defence, depends on the economic stability of eastern Europe. If we did not know that before, we know it now only too well when we consider what is happening in Yugoslavia. The news this morning that Croatia and Slovenia are turning away large numbers of refugees and asylum seekers pursued by the deadliest of forces shows that we cannot remain immune to the pressures resulting from economic instability in eastern Europe. We must address those problems, not necessarily from a sense of altruism—although rightly and properly we should be concerned about what is happening there—but because it matters to our constituents and to future generations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to the Government's know-how funds for central and eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Only last week I resigned from the advisory committee on the know-how funds, on which I have served from the beginning. I did so not through any disagreement with Ministers but due to a lack of time. The funds have done a remarkable job. In my travels in central and eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, I have heard repeated compliments paid to the British know-how funds. They are relevant, appropriate, flexible, and administered with professionalism and a lightness of touch that gives them a considerable advantage over programmes such as the Phare programme mentioned by the Minister. Those funds are an important ingredient in the way in which those countries will tackle their problems. However, the know-how funds are pathetically small. The great British achievement in uniting an amazing range of people to praise the funds is confounded by the fact that the amounts of money devoted by the British Treasury to them are pitifully small for the task and for the returns that Britain might expect from them when they have been applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also pay tribute to the imagination of the Government, although those who were responsible for the imagination have moved on to greater and, in some cases, lesser things. The creation of the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, which seeks to export political know-how, was one of the brighter ideas in a dim Government catalogue. The chairman of the Westminster foundation is a member of this Committee and he chairs that body with remarkable bipartisanship and skill. He does so because the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) and myself are his vice-chairmen and therefore give an excellent steer to it. Within six months of its foundation, we have been able to help with the process of building democratic institutions in the hope that other countries will learn something from the successes of our political system—for there are some, deeply hidden—and miss out on some of the greater perils that we have also discovered. I am sure that those countries will watch tomorrow's debate with new enthusiasm thanks to the work of the Westminster Foundation for Democracy. It

The vote tomorrow will show that the right hon. Gentleman's problems appear to be behind him—there is nobody behind me now except my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, West (Mr. Canavan) who is robustly supporting me. That is a rare but welcome occurrence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have taken a long time to respond to the Minister's statement, but it was not too long to reflect the importance of the issue. Hidden behind the obscure title of the orders, and buried in the vast documents and association agreements, is a glimmer of hope that, perhaps, we are beginning to see the way in which we might tackle the problems to the east of our continent. What is needed is vision and ambition for those countries that managed, without pain and bloodshed, to transform themselves so quickly from communist dictatorships into pluralist democracies, but which might just as easily return to such dictatorships if we miss the historic opportunity to help them. The association agreements are not enough, welcome though they are. I urge the Government to ensure that they continually consider all the issues and try, however difficult it is for them, to rise to the occasion and see beyond their own immediate huge problems and to recognise the opportunity presented to them. Britain cannot simply be self-satisfied at being the first country to ratify the agreements: it should be the first country to say that this is the first step and that there are many steps to take yet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Garel-Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) for his characteristically constructive and fair response to the debate, He is, of course, in many ways both an admirable and a tragic figure. I am choosing my words with care, because I realise that the result of the important vote that will take place tomorrow will be announced at 11 am, not at 10.30 pm—I refer to the election to the shadow Cabinet. It has always been a mystery to the hon. Gentleman's admirers, such as myself, why he is not a member of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should be placed on the record that, during the 10-year reign of terror in the Labour party, when the most respectable socialists could move about only by night from one safe house to another, the hon. Member was one of the very few who stood firm on Britian's membership of NATO; on Britain's need to retain a unilateral nuclear deterrent; and on Britain's membership of the European Community. His party, with characteristic generosity, has rewarded him for his principled stand throughout that decade by consistently failing to elect him to the shadow Cabinet. The real sadness for me is that, after a decade of that principled and difficult stand, which I and many people in politics admire, he invited the Conservative Government to rise to the occasion. Tomorrow evening, he and many who believe as he does, have an opportunity to rise to the occasion, but they have sunk to it in a lamentable manner. Although the hon. Gentleman keeps up a brave face for the media, I do not think that any of us who know and admire
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
him believe that he, for one minute, regards the amendment tabled by his party to our motion as anything other than a disreputable and tawdry little ploy. But there we are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are these attacks in order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Garel-Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, I hope that I have irreparably damaged the hon. Gentleman's prospects of joining the shadow Cabinet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his welcome for the association agreements. He is perhaps being a little unfair on some of our Community partners in saying that the wording of the agreements is not sufficiently positive in recognising and welcoming the aspiration of Poland and Hungary to be members of the Community. He is right that there have been misgivings about enlargement—not simply enlargement of the EC to include the Visegrad three, but enlargement of the European Free Trade Association. It is worth putting on the record that this is one of the areas in which the Government—from the time of the previous Prime Minister, Lady Thatcher, to the present day—have taken a lead in the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When Lady Thatcher first unfurled the banner of enlargement, it was regarded by a number of our partners with grave suspicion, and was even thought to be a British ploy to undermine the effectiveness of the Community. However, it is a great success for Britain. Even as we speak, EFTA members are on the brink of commencing negotiations to join the Community as full members. The association agreements, which we can fairly claim were a British invention, are undergoing the process of ratification for Poland and Hungary and, as the hon. Gentleman rightly said, we hope that the same will also soon apply to the Czech lands and Slovakia. That has been a long-term objective of Britain's policy in the Community, and it is happily coming to fruition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if, as is probably true, there have been some reservations on the part of some of our partners, the Government have never had any such reservations. We have made it clear, and will continue to do so, that we do not regard Community enlargement as a means of undermining the process of enhancing its effectiveness, which is also taking place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman was also right to say that the British Government are disappointed at the extent to which the trading arrangements in iron, steel, textiles and food have not been as generous and ample as we would have wished. We need no urging to make them more generous and ample. It is well known that we take a forward position in the Community on this matter. I am delighted to welcome the hon. Gentleman to that group of people in the Community—of which, as I have said, the Government are in the lead—which wants liberal, open markets. Most of the opposition to what we want to do comes from our few remaining statist, socialist partners who are eager to protect their own steel, textile and food industries in ways that do not open up the Community markets as much as we would like. However the hon. Gentleman very sensibly touched on the difficulties involved. There is a problem in Scotland with raspberries, for example. It is all very well to preach economic liberalism, but it can cause severe difficulties for our own manufacturers, traders and horticulturalists. Therefore, it has been right to include in the agreements the GATT provisions on anti-dumping, and so forth.

I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his remarks on the know-how funds. It is only fair to say that, although the Government can claim credit for taking the initiative, the success of the know-how funds is due in large measure to the fact that they have been run on a non-partisan basis. The hon. Gentleman made a substantial contribution to that. We all wish that we could put more money into them. The hon. Gentleman was right to make that point: we all agree with him, but different ends of the spectrum compete for resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his remarks about the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, which is admirably chaired by my hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, West (Sir J. Spicer). The Government are entitled to take credit for that initiative, but it can only succeed if it is run on a non-party basis. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will continue to play a role in ensuring that the democratic process takes root in eastern Europe and in assisting the understanding of democracy. Whatever democratic socialism means these days—I am not sure what it means—it should be explained to those in eastern Europe who are interested in historical studies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman summed up better than I could our self-interest—I do not want to be too moralistic—in a wider, stable Europe. There is also a moral imperative that the previous Prime Minister spotted immediately and which her successor has followed through with verve and panache. In Britain we have spent 45 years campaigning against the evils of totalitarian socialism in eastern Europe. The people of eastern Europe have revolted against that
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
and it would be immoral if we did not give them as much economic, political and financial support as possible. As the hon. Gentleman said, we have a self-interest in doing so because the preservation of a stable, democratic Europe is of prime importance to the United Kingdom. I believe that the order advances that cause, so I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
