	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Mills. I am sorry to intervene at this stage, but perhaps you could clarify the position. The Committee was originally convened to meet on Thursday of last week and we were all carded accordingly. That was cancelled and we then received cards to attend the Committee on Wednesday of this week. That was also cancelled and some members of the Committee were again carded for today. Others were not, including myself and hon. Friend the Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley). I should like an assurance that such difficulties will not arise again on statutory instruments that come before this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. I was appointed Chairman of the Committee at extremely short notice, so I cannot answer his question in full. However, I shall certainly take it up with the appropriate authorities. As Chairman of the Committee considering the statutory instrument, I assure the hon. Gentleman that I shall make representations to ensure that such a difficulty does not arise in future. It was clearly confusing and unfair to hon. Members and I shall ensure that the Gentleman receives a substantive reply that outlines the reasons why it occurred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.32 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Nicholas Soames)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Lead in Ducks and Geese) (England) Order 1992.</p></blockquote>
It may be for the convenience of members of the Committee to know about the order in more detail. The events that gave rise to it are that a private veterinary surgeon sought a diagnosis from our veterinary investigation centre at Shrewsbury of the cause of illness in a goose belonging to a farmer in Billingsley, Bridgnorth. The goose was one of some 78 geese and 300 ducks among which there had been unexplained illness and death. The post-mortem carried out on the goose sent to Shrewsbury revealed very high levels of lead in the liver of the bird—198 parts per million. For comparison, the Committee may find it helpful to know that there is a general statutory limit of one part per million for lead in food. Therefore, the problem was serious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A farm visit was immediately organised by the Ministry's veterinary investigation staff. It revealed significant numbers of ducks and geese displaying typical symptons of chronic lead poisoning. Lead shot was discovered in the gizzards of some of the birds examined. According to the farmer, his land lies directly in the path of a now defunct
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
clay pigeon shoot. Subsequent analysis of further samples revealed lead levels in kidneys and livers from birds displaying clinical symptoms to be between 100 and 400 times the general statutory maximum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In discussion with the Department of Health, we concluded that action was necessary to ensure that no birds from the affected flocks were put into the food supply. Against that background, my officials alerted the local environmental health department of Bridgnorth district council and approached the farmer to seek his co-operation in ensuring that the integrity of the food chain remained fully protected. A check of his sales and other records confirmed that there had been no sales of ducks or geese for some months prior to the current incident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was put to the farmer that all birds not displaying clinical symptoms should be moved to a clean site. They could then be released into the food chain if, after a further month, they remained healthy. A second option was that all the viscera from such birds should be removed as a prerequisite for sale. Ministry veterinary staff also explained to the farmer and to his own veterinary surgeon that there was little likelihood that birds displaying clinical symptoms of lead poisoning would recover and that they should be humanely destroyed on welfare grounds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister believe that that was a major incident, a serious incident, or neither?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The levels of lead found in the geese and ducks was such that, had they entered the food chain and been eaten, the consequences could have been extremely serious. The duty of my Department and of the Department of Health is to protect the integrity of the food chain at all times. We therefore had no option but to proceed as we did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall continue to outline the case; the hon. Gentleman may wish to interevene later. The farmer rejected the options put to him and the advice offered. In the absence of the required undertaking not to sell birds from the affected flocks for food, it was clear that statutory action would be necessary to enable us to be sure that the public were not put at risk. An order was therefore made under Part I of the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 banning the movement of the affected holding of ducks, geese and any food or feed products made from those birds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am naturally conscious of the serious impact that the restrictions are having on the farmer concerned. This morning I had a meeting with my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Gill), who is his Member of Parliament. He robustly expressed to me his concerns on behalf of the farmer. As I explained to my hon. Friend, we would not take such action lightly, nor would we do so unless there was a paramount requirement to protect the integrity of the food chain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence of risk to consumers was compelling and, in the absence of the farmer's co-operation, it was right and essential for us to act to protect the food chain. The Department is continuing to monitor the situation and to advise the farmer on the welfare implications of the incident, his management options, prospects for the safe release of birds and food products into the food chain and the future use of the land that has been affected by the clay pigeon shoot. In the meantime, our intention is that the restrictions will remain in place for as long as is necessary to ensure that consumers remain fully protected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0052">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
	<p>10.37 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, may I say that I have no criticism of the Department or of MAFF officials. From what I have heard, the way in which they conducted themselves throughout the affair is exemplary. My criticisms relate to the order; to a debate that took place in 1985 when the Food and Environment Protection Bill was being considered in Committee and on Report; to statements made by Ministers at the time; to undertakings given by Ministers on Report; and to the financial position of the farmer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order was made under section 1(8) of the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985. Mr. Haycock, the farmer concerned, was, in my view, offered a reasonable deal by MAFF when it offered to find alternative pastures for his flock. However, the issue of what happens to his land remains and the question of compensation for the incident is not provided for in current legislation. Mr. Haycock says that the order will put him out of business. He says that his flock is worth £5,000, that his land remains contaminated and that the order prohibits the use of hay on the land. He is now trying to sell that land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Haycock is aggrieved because he did not cause the pollution; it was caused by those who organised the clay shoot some 30 or 40 years ago. He claims that some of his chickens are now dying. I do not know what the position is, but I am sure that in the light of what I have said MAFF will investigate whether chickens are dying. I am sure that it will want to take the necessary action if that proves to be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter was raised in 1985 in the Committee considering the Food and Environment Protection Bill. A late colleague of ours, Brynmor John, moved an amendment that I want to draw to the Committee's attention because it gives us our first opportunity to consider whether there should be a change in the law.The amendment proposed that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Ministers may jointly by regulations provide for the payment of compensation to any person who has incurred loss or damage as a result of the making of an emergency order in circumstances where … the person responsible for the release of substances giving rise to the making of that order cannot be identified."</p></blockquote>
That is the problem. Mr. Haycock cannot identify those who were responsible, all those years ago, for polluting the land from which his stock is to be removed—an action that will result in him losing a great deal of money. If that amendment had been accepted, Mr Haycock would receive compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. John said about relevant cases:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The first is where an order is made and food is not handled, moved or sold and a crop perishes, yet is found to be unpolluted. The other case is where pollution has occurred, but no individual polluter can be identified. I gave the example of the water authorities".</p></blockquote>
He later said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I believe that amendment No. 7 and the linked amendments should be accepted, so that the Government compensate in these two rare cases. This is an emergency happening, and it is inconceivable that small producers should be asked to bear the loss"—</p></blockquote>
Mr. Haycock is a small producer—
	<br><blockquote><p>"for an accident over which they have no control and of which they often have no warning."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee H,</i> 21 March 1985; c. 44–49.]</p></blockquote>
The incidents involving Mr. Haycock precisely meets the terms of that amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Ministers tried to be helpful. The hon. Member for Medway (Dame P. Fenner), who was responsible for such matters at that time said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am assuming again that my comments on insurance"—</p></blockquote>
she believed that insurance was the way for people like Mr. Haycock to protect their interests—
	<br><blockquote><p>"would cover the person who has suffered if the polluter could not be identified and sued. On insurance, I would like to make the point that officials of my Ministry have been in touch with representatives of the insurance industry, and I can say that my noble Friend has already assured the other place that the word 'uninsurable' has not"—</p></blockquote>
there was an argument in Committee about whether that sort of risk was insurable—
	<br><blockquote><p>"passed the lips of the insurance companies with which we have been having discussions. Discussions continued over a period, but no doubt those affected by this legislation will take careful note of its implications and opportunities for the insurance industry."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee H;</i> 21 March 1985; c. 55.]</p></blockquote>
A debate raged in Committee for several hours, and was repeated on Report, on whether it was possible to insure against the possibility of orders being taken out in the future. Indeed, we must consider that today, some eight years later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. John had taken advice from insurers in the market and he said that there was a serious conflict of evidence concerning insurance. Two reputable national organisations and a reputable firm of insurance brokers said that they has asked insurance companies whether they would insure at a reasonable premium, and the answer had been no. So a Member of Parliament was told by people in the market that insurance was not available. That is very important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When Parliament considered the original legislation that gave Ministers the right to introduce the orders, Ministers expressed the view that farmers could insure against the introduction of an order that would wipe out their incomes. From subsequent information gained from the market, it appeared that such insurance policies were not available. Over recent weeks, lengthy inquiries have been made among brokers and underwriters specialising in agriculture and pollution. All have said that Mr. Haycock could not have obtained insurance against the loss in the past. In future, a person in a similar position to Mr. Haycock would be highly unlikely to be able to find a policy to cover such a loss.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not a trick question, I am trying to understand the hon. Gentleman's point. Will he define what he means by saying that the type of loss involved in that case is uninsurable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cambell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Haycock was contentedly farming his geese and ducks. An order was suddenly imposed on his land by the Government, as a result of which he has lost the use of his land and £5,000 worth of his stock, and he feels aggrieved. Someone should pay the bill. If he could not get insurance from the market to pre-empt that risk, surely the Government should provide a suitable scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had only 28 incidents since the Act was introduced in 1985. In reply to a recent parliamentary question, the Minister said that there were five cases in 1986—they related to Chernobyl—one in 1987, none in 1988, 11 in 1989—of which 10 related to the lead in an animal feed incident—five in 1990, three in 1991 and three in 1992. We are not considering vast amounts of public money. The gentleman's livelihood has been placed at risk,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0053">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
as a result of no action for which he could be held responsible. If it were impossible to secure insurance insurance, he should be compensated by a relevant authority. If a person in a similar position to Mr. Haycock were able to find a policy to cover such a loss, its cost would be prohibitive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several insurance experts, such as John Waarr of Fielding Sweeton Jones, were not surprised by that outcome of the legislation. They expected the case to be the start of a landslide of similar cases resulting and say that they predicted such a result at the time. Perhaps they exaggerate by speaking of a landslide, but it is interesting that they predicted it when Labour Members were arguing in Committee that that would be the outcome. They say that the insurance industry in general has moved against pollution liability and, in many cases, places an exclusion clause in general policies against such liability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Experts such as John Lawson of P. W. Creamer and Company say that at the heart of the legislation there is tension between two legal principles, caveat emptor—let the buyer beware—and the principle that the polluter pays. It is necessary to consider how those principles would be resolved if a major disaster occurred in Britain when the problem was multiplied many times. Thankfully, the legislation has not been tested in Britain by a major disaster—although some people might say that Chernobyl was one. Only in those circumstances will it be possible to test whether insurance claims stand up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if insurance policies exist, it is likely that, because of the amount of money involved, the meaning of the wording in policies will be subject to lengthy litigation. Victims of pollution, especially when the polluter cannot be identified or if he is a man of straw will find that they have no one to sue, no possibility of making a successful insurance claim and that no compensation will be available to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Insurance against pollution is available under an environmental impairment scheme, but it covers sudden and unintended incidents that lead to pollution, such as the unexpected rupture of an oil pipe or a chemical tank. Even if Mr. Haycock had such a policy, it is extremely unlikely that the insurance company would consider that pollution caused gradually over the years was sudden or, even given the circumstances, that it was unintended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only way in which it would be possible for someone like Mr. Haycock to have a chance of being covered in the future would be if he were to approach an insurance company to arrange for an environmental audit of his land. That is a significant proposition—a person obtaining an environmental audit of his land in the event that such insurance policies were to be made available in future would be unrealistic. Yet in 1985, when we debated the Haycocks of the future, no reference was made to insurance being made available. Such schemes are available primarily for large businesses such as chemical companies and would be prohibitively expensive for a small farmer. One insurance representative estimated that the cost of such a policy in the case to which I am referring could be as high as £10,000 per annum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. David Knott, of the underwriters Sun Alliance, also confirmed that Mr. Haycock could not have successfully insured his property against loss as a result of pollution. He said that in late 1989, early 1990, insurance companies deliberately inserted a clause into policies to exclude all but
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
sudden and unintended pollution. Sun Alliance said that that would preclude any pollution claim of such a nature and that policies before that date would not cover that sort of loss in any event.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The underwriter also said that Mr. Haycock could not claim on his insurance policy, which would cover only third parties who had sustained loss as a result of pollution from his land. He would be covered against a claim against him by his neighbour, but he would not be covered for losses due to pollution on his own land. As only third parties are covered, Mr. Heycock would have no claim against his neighbour's pollution insurance policy even if he had one. We must bear in mind that the neighbour almost certainly would not have such a policy. Even if he did, it is almost certain that pollution over a long period would not be covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the National Farmers Union adviser, the overriding legal position is that a buyer of land must beware. Mr. Haycock's solicitor, on purchase of the land at the preliminary inquiry stage, could have asked whether there was any reason why it would not be possible to use the land for breeding geese and ducks. If the solicitor had asked that question, Mr. Haycock could now rely on it. However, the chances, that that question was asked are slim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason I have laboured that specific case is because we are dealing with a principle. It is an example of what we predicted would happen during our discussions in 1985. I spoke at length in Committee and on Report predicting the inevitability of such an incident. We argued with Ministers that insurance would not cover those eventualities because insurance companies would not provide policies at reasonable prices. The Government said that they were not prepared to pay compensation because it was a matter for action in the courts between the parties concerned and they would not intervene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that we are talking about vast sums of public money, but I do believe that responsibility falls on the state when, as in this case, the financial livelihood of a man or woman is prejudiced as a result of the introduction of an order. The state must provide recompense, which is what we argued in 1985. When the Minister replies, I hope that he will say a few words on that matter. If he should find that difficult without taking further legal advice, perhaps he will correspond in some detail on those issues.

An article appeared in the magazine 	<i>Sporting Gun</i> in February 1991 for a machine called the "Clean Machine". The device was designed by an engineer called Mr. Russell Garrod and the article stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Engineer Russell Garrod is all set to let loose an unusual machine on Britain's most heavily used shooting grounds…to recover lead pellets left lying in the soil. Shooting enthusiast Russell, of Eye Hill Engineering near Ely, Cambridgeshire, has spent months and thousands of pounds perfecting his Clean Machine with civil engineer Peter Dunham. And it's now at work clearing up spent pellets at Lakenheath Rod and Gun Club in Suffolk. With impressive results. Lead, wads and broken clay fragments from years of shooting are being recovered and the soil returned to the ground in 'original' condition… The Clean Machine scoops up top soil and feeds it into a massive, rotating, drum which separates out the lead pellets. Stones and other rubbish are fed on to a conveyor belt and dumped into a trailer. Every grain of soil goes back on the land … The great beauty of the machine is that it's commercially viable and environmentally acceptable; shooting grounds can now be kept clean and any 'lost' lead recycled."</p></blockquote>
The article refers to a number of sites in the United Kingdom that are polluted by lead shot where the machine could possibly be used. I only draw attention to the article because I believe that departmental officials should be

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
aware of it. If Mr. Haycock finds it impossible to sell his land, it could be argued that such equipment should be used to clean it. If it is possible, I believe that the state and the taxpayer should pay because the order has been introduced by the Government as a result of a problem that occurred through no fault of Mr. Haycock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bob Cryer 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have joined the Committee, but not because I was selected to serve on it. That great privilege was awarded to its other Members, but not to me. However, I have taken advantage of the right of hon. Members to speak on a Standing Committee, and a very useful right it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I speak also as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments. One of the beauties of that Committee, laid down by Standing Order of the House, is that its remit includes examination of all affirmative and negative procedure instruments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The terms of the Standing Order do not allow the Committee to discuss the merits of the Instruments, but it has to draw the attention of the House to any defects that it considers they may contain. It has done so on this occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) raised the question of changes in the date of the Committee sitting. I must express appreciation for one change to the original date agreed by the Government Whips, because if it had not been made the Committee would not have completed its deliberations in time for its report to be available to this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we raise a point on an order, we must allow the Department time to provide a memorandum. It is only fair to allow a Department the opportunity to offer an explanation. If this Committee has sat on the original date, the Joint Committee would still be waiting for the memorandum from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and would not have been able to print it and provide it for this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When Committees such as this are being established, it is important for them to inquire whether an instrument has completed its consideration under the jurisdiction of the Joint Committee. The Standing Order of the Commons should be changed to resemble that of the House of Lords, which cannot debate an instrument until the consideration is complete. I hope that that explains one change in the Committee date; it does not explain the second. As a result, the eleventh report of the Joint Committee is available to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that we queried is relatively small, but it raises consequentially two further points. Schedule 4(2) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"No person shall move from the designated area any meat or other product derived from drakes, ducks, ganders or geese which are or have been in the designated area."</p></blockquote>
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food would generally interpret "other products" as food products, but it is a wide expression and it could cover feathers, for example, in which there is a commercial trade. Duvets can be filled with feathers, and if Mr. Haycock, the farmer, is in the serious financial position described by my hon. Friend, he will no doubt want to sell any products that he can that are not part of the food chain. However, the order might be interpreted as preventing him from doing so because it refers to "other product" and paragraph (2) does not specifically say, "related to the food chain".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
In its memorandum, the Department argues that any interpretation should, of necessity, be based on the preamble to the order, which emphasises food products. I stress two points. First, an order is as important to individuals and affects them as much as primary legislation. The vast bulk of legislation that emanates from this place each year derives not from primary legislation, but from the powers that the House gives Ministers by means of delegated legislation. It is, therefore, important that legislation should be as accurate as possible and should not require interpretation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As our report made clear, our counsel said that the courts would almost certainly interpret "other product" as products based on the food chain. For the phrase to be defined, it would be necessary to go to the courts. We should not put through Parliament, and Ministers should not produce, legislation that is open to such interpretation. The courts are not available to the generality of our people. They are too expensive, and the Government are considering cuts in legal aid that will make them even less accessible. It might cost £300, £400 or £500 to obtain advice from counsel. From the remarks of my hon. Friend, who has done an extremely good job of investigating the background to the order, it is clear that Mr. Haycock is not in a position to obtain an interpretation from a lawyer or to go to the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must be a general rule of Parliament that when we have to depend on interpretation by the courts, our legislation is a failure. The Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments has drawn the special attention of the House to the order because we consider the situation unsatisfactory. Orders should stand on their own merits and be clear to the users, because they will be used by ordinary people who will be bound by their terms. In this case the user will be a specific farmer in a specific area of land. An order might affect only a handful of people, such as Mr. Haycock and his family, or 1 million people, but the principle is the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful that the Committee deferred its sitting and allowed me to draw the matter to its attention and have it recorded in its proceedings. As Chairman of the Joint Committee for several years, I know that it is a continuing struggle to try to ensure that legislation is satisfactory. We all have an opportunity of participating in primary legislation, but not in delegated legislation. Orders are produced by Government Departments and presented as a 	<i>fait accompli.</i> In this case, because the order was produced to deal with an emergency there was little opportunity for consultation. I understand that; it is not a criticism. Orders are not amendable—that is one of the deficiencies. There are very few Acts that allow amendments to statutory instruments. Even though it would be easy to amend an order to clarify it and avoid the necessity for interpretation by the courts, we cannot do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Heppell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We welcome the measures that have been adopted, although we take on board the comments of my hon. Friends the Members for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) and for Bradford, South (Mr. Cryer). However, the measures and the Clean Machine to which my hon. Friend the Member for Workington referred are both attempts to shut the stable door after the horse has bolted. Preventive measures are needed.

	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
We welcome the fact that the situation covered by the order will be monitored. I recognise that there have been only about 20 such incidents, but they could recur across the country. Everyone, including the British Association for Shooting and Conservation, acknowledges that the cause must be removed, and that the cause is lead shot. I hope that when the Minister replies he will tell us his views on lead shot and that he does not share the view of the British Association for Shooting and Conservation that lead shot should be phased out by September 1997, but by a voluntary ban. If there had been a voluntary ban in the case that we have discussed, there would have been no ban at all. Statutory measures are necessary to ensure that lead shot is ruled out by 1997.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.9 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I shall deal with the points made by the hon. Member for Bradford South, who is here in his capacity as the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments. For a junior Minister to have the presence in a Committee of such a great man is a remarkable tribute to the importance not only of the order, but to the high regard the hon. Gentleman obviously has for the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr Boswell) will have heard what the hon. Gentleman rightly said about the inconvenience caused to members of the Committee because the dates of our sitting were changed. That was as inconvenient for me as it was for the hon. Gentleman, but he knows more than most that we are mere toads beneath the Whips' harrow and we have no alternative other than to heed their bidding. Nevertheless, I note what he said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the points made by the Joint Committee in its eleventh report. Our response to its criticism of the wording of the order was that, as the premable to the order clearly limits the prohibitions to a potential health hazard resulting from the human consumption of food derived from geese or ducks, the order should be read as applying only to food. Nevertheless, we undertook to consider carefully the criticism made by that Committee when drafting similar orders. The Committee was good enough to note in its report that it accepted our undertaking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell the hon. Member for Bradford, South that we have no wish to prevent Mr. Haycock, if he so wishes, from selling the feathers from those birds. To avoid any doubt, we could consider issuing a consent order under section 2(1) of the Act and we shall not bring a prosecution. I hope that I have set the hon. Gentleman's mind at rest. As for the broader aspects of such difficult legislation, we accept that it must be used extremely sparingly, and that has been so since 1985.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for the hon. Member for Workington for his remarks about the way in which officials from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food handled the matter and dealt with his inquiries. I stress that chickens are far more discriminatory feeders than geese and it is extremely unlikely that they will have picked up lead. The chickens on the farm have shown no signs so far of illness, nevertheless they will be watched with care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one who knows the hon. Member for Workington well will be surprised at the care and detail with which he presented his case this morning and the thorough research
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
that he has carried out, especially on insurance. However, now is not the time for us to go into detail about future legislation or the working of the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to take up the hon. Gentleman's general points. As he knows, no provision was made under the Food and Environmental Protection Act orders of 1985 for compensation. Not only did our late and lamented friend, Brynmor John, during the passage of the 1985 Act, propose that compensation should be paid but, when the Food Safety Act 1990 was being discussed in the House of Lords, Lord Stanley of Alderley proposed that it should be paid in such cases to which the hon. Gentleman referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee should know that all parties supported the overturning of those amendments when the 1990 Act was discussed further in the House of Commons. It was argued that Ministers should not be constrained by financial consideration when introducing public protection measures. Officials from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food spoke to the insurance industry in 1989. It was accepted that cover could be provided, but that the premium would be high if the demand for it was low.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the hon. Gentleman's principal point was not so much that cover could not be arranged because Lloyd's and other insurance markets would, if there was a demand for it, ensure that there was capacity for a risk to be insured. Whatever criticisms may have been made of Lloyd's in the past few years, no one would deny that it remains the greatest insurance market in the world and coverage of any major or minor risk for which there is a demand can be obtained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point about insurance made by the hon. Member for Workington. As he knows, the Department has been much involved in that matter recently in relation to farmers in Derbyshire, in the constituency of the hon. Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner), who has vigorously represented the views of his constituents to me. He says that they should be compensated by the Government. The other day we were also pressed vigorously by the "Country File" television programme on why we should not have laws similar to those of Holland. I believe that the Dutch have a national fund from which compensation is paid and their Government then pursue the polluter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not have a similar provision in our legislation and there is no point in trying to deal with the position as we would like it to be; we must deal with it as it is in relation to the order. I have noted the points made by the hon. Member for Workington and I give him an undertaking that we shall continue to keep a careful eye on the issues. As he pointed out, the orders are used extremely sparingly and only when they are essential. He also said that we are talking about relatively small sums of Government money. The difficulty is that Ministers must not be constrained in undertaking acts of public protection by the possibility of having to pay large amounts in compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, that represents a serious blow to Mr. Haycock and I appreciate that the points made by the hon. Member for Workington were directed to helping him in the serious and unfortunate position in which he finds himself. The hon. Gentleman will want to know that Mr. Haycock purchased the land in about 1983, but he did not buy it with the intention of farming ducks and geese. I understand that his original farming operation was for sheep. It was only a short time ago that he decided to diversify into ducks and geese and, in doing so, he built a pond on which they could live. The spoil from the pond was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0056">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
scattered round the farm and the lead shot was contained in that spoil. We accept that that was a most unfortunate turn of events but, as matters stand under legislation, it is for Mr. Haycock and his advisers to pursue the polluter on the principle that the polluter pays.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noted what the hon. Member for Workington said about the "Clean Machine" and lead shot. We take seriously suggestions that might be of help to us and I know that my officials will have taken note of that made by the hon. Gentleman. We shall draw the attention of the Department of the Environment to that machine to see whether it could be of use. People in the country have strong feelings about clay pigeon shooting, so we wish to keep the matter under careful review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Nottingham, East (Mr. Heppell) asked what the Government were doing to encourage the use of non-toxic shot in shotgun cartridges. The Department of the Environment is pursuing an initiative on the substitution of steel for lead in shot for 12-bore cartridges used in wildfowling over wetlands. It is hoped that such shot will be available in commercial quantitites by September 1995 so that the use of lead shot over wetlands can be fully phased out by September 1997.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current incident arose from entirely different circumstances, that is, from clay pigeon shooting more than a decade previously. We are considering the best medium for giving advice to farmers on protecting stock on land which may have been shot over.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a thorough and considered debate and the hon. Member for Workington has rightly raised important issues relating to the livelihood of Mr. Haycock, for whom we must all have a great deal of sympathy. It remains the view of the Government that the measures that we took to protect the integrity of the food chain were unavoidable, bearing in mind the high degree of lead poisoning. I hope that the Committee will see fit to endorse the Government's stand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Haycock's income has been destroyed as a result of action taken by the Government to solve a problem that he did not create. I have argued that he should be compensated by the state in the absence of reasonably priced insurance being available on the market. The Minister said that those matters were considered in another place in 1989 and that because the House of Lords
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
felt that by placing a responsibility on Ministers to compensate might interfere with the judgment to take action, it would be improper to introduce legislative change. That is not a reasonable position for the Government to take. Mr. Haycock may well be one of a number of people who have been similarly affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that his Department would consider these matters and keep an eye on developments. He has not given an undertaking that Mr. Haycock will be compensated in any way for the removal of his income and the destruction of his livelihood and property, I put it to the Minister that the state could act, even without an amendment to the law, simply by purchasing that site.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that we do not have to change the law of the land to enable the Department to purchase that site. Perhaps the Minister would clarify whether that is the position. It would then be a matter of discretion for the Ministers. I am sure that Ministers are in a position to purchase land for their use or for whatever reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Minister has tried to be helpful, he has not sufficiently dealt with the possibility of people's incomes being destroyed. The Government could have reacted more reasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to delay the Committee. I appreciate the learned Gentleman's point. I must emphasise that there is no provision under the Food and Environment Act 1985 for the payment of compensation. It is not true that the order caused Mr. Haycock's difficulties; the lead poisoning in his birds caused them. More than half his birds have died. Our order has protected the integrity of the food chain, which we are absolutely, irrevocably obliged to do. I hope that, in the light of that discussion and our shared concern and anxiety about Mr. Haycock, the Committee will see fit to support the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
