Draft Veterinary Surgeons Qualifications<br><br> (EEC Recognition) (Amendment) Order 1993</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. David Currry)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Veterinary Surgeons Qualifications (EEC Recognition) (Amendment) Order 1993.</p></blockquote>
I hesitate to tell any Committee that a measure is purely technical in case members of the Committee think that I am having them on. In fact the draft order is almost less than technical. It is a minor procedural change to meet Community obligations. We have mutual recognition of qualifications in veterinary surgery and other areas. The measure does not deal with any question of principle, but with circumstances in which mutually recognised qualifications change.<br><br>
There are two elements in the order. First, it would change the names of the qualifications in Spain and Greece, and, in particular, it would change the awarding body and the type of qualification. Secondly, where the qualification has changed anywhere in the Community because of that, it would protect the status of people who held the prior qualification which was part of the mutual recognition arrangements. Those are the exclusive matters dealt with by the order.<br><br>
In practice, the changes have been implemented by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons since 1991. It is entirely happy with the formalisation of the arrangement. The arrangement permits people only to register as veterinary surgeons. It does not guarantee employment because that is a matter for those who might want to hire them.</span></p>
<p>10.31 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours <span class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that the draft order is a technical measure. However, I want to raise one or two small matters.<br><br>
Paragraph 2 refers to:
<br><blockquote><p>"(diploma of veterinary surgeon) from the faculty of geotechnical sciences of the Aristotle University of Saloniki or the School of veterinary medicine of the Aristotle University of Saloniki".</p></blockquote>
Despite faxing that institution last night from the Library to find out about that qualification, I have not extracted a reply. I wanted to establish the basis on which it claimed that the qualification was equal to a similar qualification available in the United Kingdom.<br><br>
I understand that the European Commission has a committee which examines whether, on application, it should accept that qualifications are equal. Can the Minister tell the Committee anything about the course at those two faculties? I spoke to the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons last night and, as the Minister said, it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
has no problem with the arrangement. The Committee is entitled to know the basis on which it has been accepted that the qualifications are equal in value.<br><br>
There are many schools in the member states of the European Community. Over the years, the nature of training has been discussed by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. In addition to work carried out within the Community, the college has kept a roaming eye on that matter. It has expressed concern about student-teacher ratios and course content. It is for the Community to be satisfied that qualifications are equal.<br><br>
I understand that economies in sectors of the Commission's budgets have placed a question mark over funds to ensure that there is equivalence. I should like the Minister to give the Committee an undertaking that the part of the European budget that is allocated to examining for equivalence will be fully protected so that we and British veterinary surgeons can be assured that training available abroad is equal to that in the United Kingdom.<br><br>
One of the reasons for raising the issue is a dispute which, to some extent, is still going on. Since the beginning of the year, environmental health officers are no longer responsible for inspecting abattoirs. The role has been given to veterinary surgeons, whose services are costly for local authorities and abattoirs. It would be wrong if the quality of labour available for meat inspection in some member states was not as high as that in the United Kingdom, or if abattoirs abroad were able to hire people at lower prices, thereby becoming more competitive.</span></p>
<p>10.35 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Shaw <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dover)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a small constituency interest and concern on this issue, in so far as many live animals are exported from Dover port. We maintain that the trade should continue and that standards should remain high.<br><br>
Before 31 December ports were controlled by British rules and regulations and British veterinary surgeons checked the export, quality, condition and welfare of the animals. Will veterinary checks on animals that are exported through Dover port now be undertaken by vets from the EC, whose standards may be lower than British veterinary standards? Could there be a further diminution in standards?<br><br>
I recently met farmers from my constituency who support the trade, but they are concerned that it should be carried out with a high standard of animal welfare. The Government have taken the lead in Europe in trying to promote the highest possible standards in animal welfare for the trade. There is concern that standards have been loosened since 1 January. I am concerned that they could be further loosened by recognition of veterinary qualifications that are below the standard that has so far operated in the United Kingdom. I should be grateful if the Minister could comment on that.</span></p>
<p>10.38 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Stevenson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I seek further clarification of the issues that have been raised. They are important, although I recognise that the Minister is correct in saying that, in essence, the measure is technical. Technical measures have a habit of sometimes rearing up and biting, if care is not taken at the outset.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0302">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
I can inform the hon. Member for Dover (Mr. Shaw) that for many years it has been the practice to subject meat for export to veterinary checks. Meat for the home market has not had such checks, and that is one of the significant changes. However, the hon. Gentleman raises a valid point.<br><br>
I seek clarification on standards. Can the Minister elaborate on how the scheme will be monitored? How will we be assured that monitoring will be effective and that high standards will be maintained as the recognition of qualifications becomes Community-wide? The Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons seems to be satisfied about the way the scheme has been implemented since 1991. How will the scheme be monitored so that we can be sure that those high standards are maintained?</span></p>
<p>10.39 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Green way <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ryedale)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Veterinary surgeons who have been trained in the United Kingdom have the reputation of being the best trained and most professional veterinary surgeons in the European Community. As a result of the Order may we look forward over the medium to longer term to them taking posts abroad so that the standards of veterinary medicine and, particularly, of inspection of livestock on the continent, can be brought up to United Kingdom standards?</span></p>
<p>10.40 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Budgen <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wolverhampton, South-West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The debate seems to have developed into a wider discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Budgen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister could give us some information about how the Government think the veterinary profession will develop. The profession seems to have been at the forefront of rows about the way in which the Community is developing, particularly regarding the new requirements for abattoirs, which used to be operated on a small-scale, local basis but which are becoming increasingly large and expensive to set up and run. Much of the expense is accounted for by the requirement to have very intelligent, well-qualified veterinary surgeons available at every stage.<br><br>
Our age group knows from the agony of seeing our children trying to get into university, that the most highly qualified students are those who want to study veterinary science. I am reminded that, usually, three or four grade As at A level are necessary to get into any of the places in this country that offer qualifications in veterinary surgery. Those highly intelligent, hard-working, extremely well-qualified people are then required to do the often boring and menial job of looking at meat. Previously that job was done by less qualified people.<br><br>
Perhaps the Minister could refer to this matter because many members of the Committee think that the EC is becoming increasingly preoccupied with expensively acquired qualifications, rather than operating in a more pragmatic way, as the bad old British system used to operate, with less qualified people using their experience and common sense.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
<p>10.42 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr.Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First I shall try to deal with the question by the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) as to how we establish which qualifications should be recognised. The Community has laid down a training directive that spells out the essential content of the course. I shall be happy to abstract from that directive the esential qualifications and write to the hon. Gentleman and other members of the Committee spelling out the sine qua non of the contents of the course.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Workington asked how the inspection is carried out, and the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Stevenson) also asked about that. That matter is the responsibility of a committee of national experts. The process is not carried out by bureaucrats but by veterinary experts of each member state who perform a tour of inspection of institutions in each member state.<br><br>
I take account of what the hon. Member for Workington said about the provision of finance. As he will know, the Paymaster General is responsible for budgetary matters for the Government, and I shall draw his attention to the hon. Gentleman's concern about that budget provision. We certainly want standards to be vigorously enforced. I shall pass on to him the comments that have been made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that he wants those standards to be vigorously enforced. Will he assure the Committee that the Government would oppose any attempt to reduce moneys available for monitoring equivalence in standards?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly assure the hon. Gentleman that I shall tell the Paymaster General that it is a matter of the utmost importance to my Department and entrust him to take consequential action in the budgetary council. Nothing that we have discussed in the Committee makes a blind bit of difference to veterinary checks at Dover. Those veterinary surgeons are appointed by my Department as part of the state veterinary service. My hon. Friend the Member for Dover will find that we appoint only those who have an eye for the highest standards of animal welfare because we are aware of the concerns that are expressed throughout the country.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South asked about monitoring. That is in the hands of national experts, not in the hands of bureaucrats. I was asked about British veterinary surgeons working abroad and vice versa. We know about some working abroad. We believe that there are 11 in Germany; 11 in France; 63 in Ireland and one in Denmark. A greater number of overseas veterinary surgeons are working in the United Kingdom, partly because, traditionally, they perform a rather wider range of tasks—especially in the food-health and food-hygiene sector—on the Continent than veterinary surgeons in the United Kingdom. Figures are available because in the United Kingdom people are registered. There are some 500 in total, but not all of them are working.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) asked about veterinary surgeons in abattoirs. He will know that that is a feature of the inspection arrangements that came into force on 1 January and apply to people in abbatoirs, although not in cutting plants where people with less formal qualifications can continue to work. Some local authorities have experienced problems in finding vets willing to undertake the work and,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0303">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
in some cases, charges have been excessive. We are considering whether to put some sort of cap on the charges that can be levied. There is scientific proof that, in ante-mortem inspections, qualified vets can identify some potential problems which may not be picked up by people with lesser qualifications. It is essential that veterinary surgeons should fulfil that ante-mortem function in the slaughterhouse.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Budgen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is there any evidence that the less well-qualifed people did a bad job and made mistakes?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We believe that if vets do the job—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Greenway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not answering the question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have hardly started to answer the question. The answer is that some cases of disease have been picked up by vets during ante-mortem inspection. It is essential that such cases be indentured and not go on to slaughter. The obvious case is that of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, which was identified by veterinary surgeons at ante-mortem inspection.<br><br>
No slaughterhouse has yet been refused a permit. We are considering the matter of costs to see whether we can make the more reasonable because costs are causing considerable concern. I know that that is at the top of the agenda of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like more clarification on the point that I raised. A qualified body of experts checks the maintenance of academic standards. We anticipate that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
they will do their job thoroughly. However, that was not the context in which I asked my question. Once people have the necessary qualifications and a certificate and are allowed to practice in any member state, as this technical order by its incorporation into British law will allow, how will their effectiveness be monitored? There is sometimes a gap between academic qualifications and the ability to maintain the necessary standards when the job is actually being done.<br><br>
My question was not so much how will academic centres' standards be checked as how the activities of those from other academic centres who have the necessary qualifications and certificates and who come to the United Kingdom will be monitored. We need to be assured that academic centres will be monitored and told how that will work in practice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Monitoring in this country will be undertaken by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons in the same way that it would monitor any veterinary surgeon of whatever nationality who had received endorsement of registration from the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Veterinary Surgeons Qualifications (EEC Recognition (Amendment) Order 1993.</p></blockquote></p>
