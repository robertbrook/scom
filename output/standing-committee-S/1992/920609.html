	<div class='legislation'>Draft Education (National Curriculum) (Foundation Subjects at Key Stage 4) Order 1992</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education (Mr. Eric Forth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Education (National Curriculum) (Foundation Subjects at Key Stage 4) Order 1992.</p></q>
The draft order would amend section 3(2) of the Education Reform Act 1988 by removing art and music from the list of subjects that 14 to 16-year-olds are compelled to study under the national curriculum. It is the last of a series of measures introduced to increase flexibility and choice in the curriculum for pupils aged 14 to 16. Those measures reflect concern about the pressures on the school timetable for that age group if there is to be room for specialisation, for the study of a wider range of academic subjects—for example, the classics or a second modern language—or for vocational study.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right to require pupils up to the age of 14 to study all the subjects of the national curriculum. We need to ensure that our children receive a rigorous foundation in each subject of the national curriculum, including art and music. However, as pupils grow older, they and their parents and teachers begin to look at what lies beyond compulsory schooling, whether in work or in further study. They need to be able to make choices that will help them to progress towards their future responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Introducing flexibility is not a retreat from the principles of the national curriculum. In the last two years of compulsory education, we can offer room for specialisation and differentiation, and should do so. We therefore propose that the legal requirement for pupils aged 14 to 16 to study art and music should be lifted. I commend the draft order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Fatchett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister to his new appointment and am glad of the opportunity to debate education with him not only in Committee but on the Floor of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not being critical when I say that the Minister is new to the education debate; it is simply a statement of fact. Since he has taken over as Under-Secretary of State for Education, he has doubtless had the opportunity to read the 	<i>Hansard</i> reports of the Standing Committee's work what was then the Education Reform Bill. I am sure that he would have enjoyed every moment. However, he would also have seen that his argument was put then by the Opposition. It is always a pleasure to see the Minister support Labour party policy. It may be rare, but we welcome it and hope that there will be many similar occasions. I realise that his post is not the subject of election within the Conservative party, so I can sing his praises without damning any possibility of his being elected to a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
higher position. My inside information suggests that that would in any case be difficult, but if the need arises I shall do my best for him as campaign manager.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Minister's conversion to Labour party policy, but it raises several interesting points. It is worth doing more than the Minister has done: We should talk about the success of 14 to 16-year-olds in the arts at key stage 4 and the growth in the number of youngsters taking GCSE arts subjects. The interest shown by youngsters in the performing arts, such as drama and dance, has grown substantially, as has the number of GCSE and post-GCSE examination successes. We should welcome that because the arts make a distinctive contribution to school life. I realise that the Minister is not saying that children should not have that aesthetic experience. However, it is worth remembering that Her Majesty's inspectorate and the Gulbenkian report recognise that the arts can help individuals across a range of experiences. For instance, many youngsters have developed self-confidence and an ability to express themselves as a result of studying drama and the other performing arts. We must not lose that range of experiences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister comes to wind up this possibly short debate, he will, I know, want to join me in congratulating those who have been involved in the delivery of the arts in our schools on their success and on the way in which those subjects have played a substantial role in the development of the school curriculum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also needs to clarify certain points that are central to the Government's policy. If he had read the comments that we made during consideration of the Education Reform Bill, he would know that the Labour party argued for greater flexibility at key stage 4. The Government have now taken that on board, but the problem with converts is that they come late to a viewpoint and fail to understand it in its entirety. That is the difficulty for the Minister and the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not consider the curriculum at key stage 4 piecemeal. The Government need to ask the National Curriculum and the School Examinations and Assessment Council to examine how key stage 4 is working and to consider its integration into other parts of the national curriculum and into post-16 education. The Government cannot have flexibility on some subjects and then try to pretend that that does not relate to the curriculum as a whole. What we need—and what the Government fail to do in this draft order—is to examine the whole of the post-14 curriculum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister give a commitment that at some stage the Government will produce a draft order which deals with the whole of key stage 4? We could debate such an order and consider how to make progress. All the three major political parties now agree—uniquely, perhaps, on educational issues—on this point. We need flexibility, but the way in which the Government are going about it is likely to cause problems for schools. There is a danger, for instance, that the flexibility provided for in this draft order will result in the arts being relegated to a second-class subject area. That may not be best for individual youngsters or for the development of expertise in particular schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need a debate and perhaps a draft order so that we can examine the whole of key stage 4.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Keith Hampson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be useful to put the record straight before anyone assumes that the Labour party has taken the lead on the national curriculum. I remember that in 1976 we had an entire year of the so-called great debate when the national curriculum was discussed across the country. The Labour party could not make up its mind what to do. It did not want a national curriculum and it has not wanted one for a very long time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fatchett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we pursued this historical debate we might get out of order. However, may I suggest to the hon. Gentleman—I know that he takes a keen interest in these matters—that if he looks at the Second Reading debate on the Education Reform Bill in November 1987 he will see references in my speech and in that of my hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw) to the Labour party's commitment over a number of years to the development of a national core curriculum. The hon. Gentleman will also know—although this does not go back quite as far as some of the earlier references—that in the 1987 general election all three major political parties were committed to the development of a national core curriculum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the hon. Gentleman cannot say so openly, I suspect that privately he agreed with the Labour party when we argued for a tight core but with flexibility. The right hon. Member for Mole Valley (Mr. Baker) wanted a much tighter straitjacket for the national curriculum. The hon. Gentleman differs from his hon. Friends because, having been a teacher and having been involved in education, he trusts teachers. The Conservative party's education policy from 1987 onwards has been to mistrust teachers and to place a staitjacket on the individual syllabus and on the national curriculum. I know that quietly and covertly the hon. Gentleman, who was a useful member of the Standing Committee, was very keen to support Labour party policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerry Steinberg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(City of Durham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is also true that the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West (Dr. Hampson) supported Labour party policy on the review body for university staff, but unfortunately when it came to the vote he voted against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fatchett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Hogg, I may have become a conduit for an interesting discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. With all these people supporting Labour party policy I wonder why it lost the election. Will the hon. Member for Leeds, Central (Mr. Fatchett) return to the main point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fatchett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The simple explanation is that the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West stood as a Conservative and fooled people on that basis. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] My hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) makes an interesting point that I shall not pursue. I suggest to the hon. Gentleman and to my hon. Friend that they discuss the point later because it is worthy of further discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has talked about the need to develop specialist schools, post-11 on some occasions and post-14 on others. If there are to be specialist schools—for the performing arts, technology, the classics, humanities, economics or vocational subjects—what will be the relationship between those schools and the national curriculum? Will there be an opt-out from the national curriculum so that specialist schools can tilt the balance in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
the curriculum towards the specialist subject? If it is the intention that that should take place at the age of 11, as the Secretary of State for Education seemed to suggest on his recent visit to Birmingham, what will happen to key stage 3? If that is the intention, why have key stage 3 testing at the age of 14? There cannot be a universal system if the Government intend to develop specialist schools. Are we having almost the last debate about key stages 3 and 4? Do the Government intend to scrap the national curriculum? A national framework and specialisation may not easily fit together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will there be guidelines on specialisation? Will those guidelines suggest that a certain percentage of the school timetable should be spent on certain subjects, such as the prescribed subjects of English, maths and science? The Government have to come clean. They have talked about magnet schools and specialist schools. Will those schools differ and how will they operate outside the national curriculum?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the Government's intention that virtually every secondary school should opt out. Will they opt out in to specialist status? The hon. Member for Castle Point (Dr. Spink) nods wisely. He has clearly read the central office brief with great interest. The hon. Gentleman should not try to pretend that he is a free thinker; the Whips will be very worried about that. There is never any joy in the Conservative party for free-thinkers, unless at some stage they wish to run for the leadership of the Conservative party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Castle Point has read the brief and wishes to see the opting out of all secondary schools. Where opt-out has taken place so far, it is a Conservative phenomenon. The majority of the schools that have opted out have opted out of Conservative-controlled local government. There is a very good reason for that. Those schools have opted out of the low levels of investment that Conservatives put into education. It is not, as the former Prime Minister said in one of her triumphalist interviews in 	<i>The Independent</i> in September 1987, a Labour phenomenon. The fact about opt-outs is that schools are opting out of the control of the Conservatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opt-outs have not taken off. There is now a new salesperson for the opt-out campaign, I read a Department of Employment press release that said that the Under-Secretary was travelling round to visit as many schools as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is rare.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fachett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, as my hon. Friend says, it is rare for an Education Minister to do that. Presumably, the Under-Secretary wishes to bring the good news to teachers that there is a new face at the Department of Education and also to try to sell the policy. So far the policy has failed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Under-Secretary is right in his assumption that the policy will take off. It is implicit in the Secretary of State's statement that those schools may become specialist schools. What would then happen to the national curriculum, which the Minister has told his constituents is a good means of levering up standards? Is he dropping the national curriculum? Does he want specialisation at the cost of the national curriculum? We know why the Conservative party wants opt-outs in the secondary sector. It wants selection at the age of 11 and does not have the courage to tell the electorate. Whenever the Conservative party has had to put the argument about grammar schools

to the public, it has lost the debate. It will continue to lose that argument because selection is wasteful. The Conservative party want selection through the back door of opt-out, but does it want specialisation in a way that would end the national curriculum?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Robert Spink 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Castle Point)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since the two systems of specialisation and grant-maintained status both embrace excellence, that does not mean that they are mutually exclusive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fachett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention, because he represents an Essex constituency. Essex county council has been a major loser in the grant-maintained game. Schools are opting out of Essex control. I understand some of the reasons for that. I attended a meeting in Essex a few months ago at which the chairman of the Conservative-controlled education authority said that he was sorry about the cuts in school budgets. The decision was not his but had been imposed on him by the standard spending assessment made by the Government. I understand the internal difficulties for the Conservative party in Essex and the hon. Gentleman's embarrassment about arguing for grant-maintained status when his local education authority strongly opposes it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Spink</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a matter of correction, the Essex education authority has not made cuts. It increased capital spending by 14.7 per cent. last year and by double the rate of inflation, about 8 per cent., this year. The 8 per cent., figure refers to revenue, the earlier figure to capital.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fatchett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a difference between Conservative office briefs and those of the chairman of the education committee. I suggest that the hon. Gentleman should talk to his colleague, the chairman of the education committee, who has a different view of what is happening to education in Essex.

What will happen to the national curriculum? I hope that in his reply the Minister will outline the balance of the national curriculum and the level of specialisation and say when the Government intend to give their overall view of the key stage 3 and key stage 4 developments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Typically, the Government have come to the right decision on education but without understanding the arguments, or going the whole way. We need a full reappraisal of key stage 4: how to make it work, how to inject flexibility and how to allow student choice. The Government's approach will lessen the importance of arts subjects and will not achieve flexibility. We need answers on that and on specialisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Member for Leeds, Central (Mr. Fatchett), I welcome flexibility within key stage 4 and within all parts of the national curriculum. I do not want to get into a battle about where the concept of flexibility originated. If I said that it was with the Liberal Democrats, we would argue left, right and centre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's move towards flexibility is welcome. I agree that we need a major review of key stage 4 and of how to organise the desperately needed flexibility. The move towards flexibility does not imply that music and art should wither on the vine for pupils in the 14 to 16 age group. Many hon. Members are worried about the present
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
shortage of music teachers. I shall be interested in the Minister's comments on that shortage and on any plans that the Government have in mind for training music teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be growing concern in local education authorities about the effects of charge capping and other cuts to the education budget for extra-curricular activities, where music and art play such an important part. In my own constituency, which is covered by the local education authority of the county of Avon, charge capping is creating a serious problem for the continuation of work in the extracurricular areas of music and art, of which the county is justifiably proud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, too, would be interested to hear answers to the questions about flexibility, specialisation and grant-maintained status. I suspect that this is not the correct place for that debate, so I shall not pursue it. I very much support the move towards flexibility, but I do not believe that it can be achieved in the way that has been proposed: by taking bits out of key stage 4 and leaving other bits in. A major review is required. Therefore, I support what previous speakers have said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Mildred Gordon 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bow and Poplar)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While I believe that 14-year-old should have flexibility of choice, I should be very worried if music and art education were lost in the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to indulge in some personal reminiscences, which I believe are valid. When I was a child, my mother was very poor and could not afford the fare or the uniform to send me to any of the exclusive schools that were on offer to junior county scholars, so she sent me to the local grammar school. As it wanted to do its best for east end kids, it pushed us through as many academic subjects as possible for matriculation, to the extent that we learnt scripture by reading the Bible in French to enable us to have extra time studying French. Every pupil at that school dropped music, art and similar subjects at the age of 14. The message was that those subjects were not as important as academic subjects and that we did not have time for frills, which is what they were considered to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had been told that I was tone deaf, so I was glad to be relieved of the humiliation of music lessons. If I had been asked, I would have said that I did not want to study music any more, but, some years later, when I met girls from the more exclusive schools, I began to realise how deprived I was and how much better was their education. They had wider cultural background and a wider understanding of the arts and some knowledge of a musical instrument stays with us all out lives, while the Pythagoras therorem and things of that ilk are forgotten. In the long term, music and art are among the most important things we learn. Therefore, if the curriculum is to be flexible, it must be balanced by strong guidance from the Government to schools so that the curriculum is not entirely academic and subjects such as art and music are not dropped because they are considered to be frills. I know that in primary and junior schools music permeates the day in many ways, but that is not the case in secondary schools. If those subjects do not form part of the curriculum, there is a danger that they will be dropped entirely after the age of 14. I should hate to see that happen. It would be a severe loss to pupils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike Gapes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ilford, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, Central. Although we should allow young people of 14, 15 or 16 to make informed choices about their own future, sometimes peer group pressures is such that they make choices that they later regret. I formed an appreciation of impressionist painting only in my 20s. In my teens I was not interested in such things. I very much regret that I cannot play any musical instrument. I gave up music at school when I was given that option of doing music or woodwork or art. In my school we had to give up one of those subjects each year to concentrate on O-level subjects at the later stage. There is a danger that by crudely changing the way in which we deal with these subjects, we could deter those children who should take them up and who come from families that have little interest in music and art from making informed choices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While is support my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, Central I have some concerns about the measure. It will need to be considered and reviewed if there is any indication that large numbers of young people will not have the benefit of learning art or music as part of their education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Banks 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harrogate)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I make a short intervention and congratulate my hon. Friend on bringing forward the measure? It is entirely right to make this provision. Art and music are enormously important. Everyone recognises that when those subjects are taught they can lead to lifelong appreciation. My music teacher was thankful when I gave up trying to learn the piano after about two attempts. I have never been very good at art, but having been taught art appreciation, I am very grateful for the enjoyment that I have since had from it. Had I been forced, however, to take examinations in a subject for which I had no aptitude, it would have been a disaster and would have turned me away from what I now enjoy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is entirely right that we should pursue the teaching of art and music, but that we should drop it at key stage 4, as suggested in the order. I give it full support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.58 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Immediately may I thank the hon. Member for Leeds Central for his kind words. I welcome his welcome for my welcome for his welcome for whatever has happened over the past few months. Having arrived at this stage, I am spared any blushes that there might otherwise have been because, as I have arrived so recently on the education scene, my slate is relatively clean. I have none of the baggage or burdens that one might normally carry in these circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is encouraging to notice that there is common ground between all the political parties. I hope that that will be to the advantage of education as a whole. I do not want to use that tired old phrase about political footballs. Justifiable arguments can be made about these important matters. I feel no sense of shame at finding common ground. If we have been able to move in the direction that Opposition Members have been suggesting for some time, so be it, and I am delighted to have made them happier people as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
Let me say in passing that I think that the recent election is over and that the result has been decided. If Opposition Members are still involved in it and feel the need to expound their thoughts accordingly, I would not want for a moment to deny them that opportunity. We, however, are getting down to business. No doubt the Opposition will catch up with us in a few weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, I join the hon. Member for Leeds Central and his hon. Friends in welcoming the considerable progress that has been made in the treatment of arts and music in education. I join Opposition Members in praising the teachers involved for the dedicated work that they do to enthuse pupils. I was at a school in London just the other day. I hope that members of the Committee saw the rather attractive picture of me in 	<i>The Times</i> today, portraying that visit. During that visit, I went into a classroom where music was being taught. I saw how that enthusiasm was communicated to a group of seven-year-olds. They were at the early stage of developing an appreciation which I am sure we all hope will grow. Our view—which, plainly, is shared—is that it is right that such appreciation should develop and grow up to the age of 14 and it is thus defined in the national curriculum. By then, most youngsters can begin to understand—guided by teachers, parents and others—the subjects which they may or may not wish to study in more detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As art and music, for example, are included in the national curriculum's subjects up to the age of 14, many young people will want to continue them to GCSE and beyond. That is good; it is their choice. Therefore they determine what they want from education and from which subjects they will derive most benefit. However, to go on from that and from the limited matters covered by the order and say that we should embark on a general review by the National Curriculum Council or the School Examinations and Assessment Council of key stage 4 as a whole—as the hon. Member for Leeds Central and, I believe, the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) suggested—is not necessarily right at this time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been struck by the extent to which people in education say, "We have had so many upheavals and changes that we need a period of consolidation and stability." Invariably I ask them, "You do not mean, do you, that there should be no changes? You are not suggesting that we freeze everything as it is in every respect, are you?" They answer, "No, we do not mean that. There should be some adjustments, fine tuning or changes", which I believe this order would bring about. However, we must keep in perspective the yearning among educationists for a period of stability and predictability, one in which all those involved can come fully to terms with the curriculum and with testing, to the benefit of the children. That, I believe, should be the priority. Therefore, I tend to resist calls, no matter how attractively expressed, for widespread reviews at this stage. I doubt whether calls for a review would be widely echoed in education. Some people may believe, and legitimately so, that changes of detail can be made. This order is perhaps a good example of that. But please, at this stage, let us not have widespread reviews or more fundamental upheavals. I do not believe that that is what people want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fatchett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Minister's remarks about what, in education jargon, is called innovation fatigue. There have been too many quick changes. We had arguments about them in the previous Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
Perhaps I may take up the point made by my hon. Friends the Members for Ilford, South (Mr. Gapes) and for Bow and Poplar (Ms. Gordon) about the development of the order when it becomes law and is implemented in schools. There is danger of an imbalance in the experience of some youngsters between the ages of 14 and 16. There is the difficult task of providing freedom of choice, together with a structure. I understand what the Minister said about that. However, we must avoid circumstances in which youngsters do not have breadth of experience. The Government's previous statements about the national curriculum show that breadth of experience is needed. Much experience was brought together through the National Curriculum Council. It reviewed the curriculum in schools prior to the implementation of the national curriculum and revealed that the curriculum was getting squeezed for too many youngsters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that background, if the Minister rejects a review of key stage 4, how will he monitor the implementation and development of key stage 4? It is important that, at that age, we achieve choice and flexibility and also maintain some discipline and structure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly. That is an important question. The answer is fairly simple. The National Curriculum Council has its tasks to perform. Soon, we shall have the new inspectorate to which we shall look to provide us with much information about how schools perform and what is happening in them. In that respect, we shall define its remit fairly broadly. We are also putting in place the increasingly broad reporting systems, which may not be universally welcome but which should help all those who want more
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
information about what is happening in our schools, and how they are performing and achieving. Over the next two or three years, that will provide us with a much clearer picture. We shall know what is successful and what is unsuccessful. That process will give us the opportunity to make necessary changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not deny that changes will have to be made—I am sure that members of the Committee will agree with that—but we shall soon have in place a sophisticated series of mechanisms whereby better and more sharply defined information will be available, on which we can base the decisions that will need to be made to develop education within the broad framework that we have defined. I hope that I shall not need to say much more. I am pleased that on this occasion, my first opportunity to appear in Committee in connecton with my new responsibilities, I have been able to operate against a background of such commonality of approach and harmony. I hope that that will always be so, and that we shall always be able to reach such harmonious conclusions so quickly or—dare I say it?—occasionally even more quickly.
