	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='legislation'>Post Office (Abolition of Import Restrictions) Regulations 1993</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. Patrick McLoughlin)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Post Office (Abolition of Import Restrictions) Regulations 1993 (S.I. 1993, No. 1324).</p></blockquote>
The statutory instrument amends section 63(5) of the Post Office Act 1953 by removing the restriction on the import of fictitious stamps and the material means for making them into the United Kingdom from other member states of the European Community. Let me stress that it is a technical amendment designed to bring our legislation into compliance with our obligations under article 30 of the treaty of Rome. It will remain a criminal offence, under section 63(1) of the 1953 Act, for any person to possess or sell a fictitious stamp or to possess the material means for making such stamps anywhere in the United Kingdom. It will also still be illegal for any person to be in possession of these things on entering the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the treaty of Rome, member states are under an obligation to facilitate the achievement of a single market, and to remove any restrictions on the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital. Restrictions on the importation of goods can be permitted only, if they can be objectively justified as being consistent with article 30 of the treaty, which ensures the free movement of goods, for example under article 36 of the treaty. Given the prohibitions on the possession, selling and making of fictitious stamps in subsections (1) and (2) of section 63 of the Post Office Act 1953, the Government do not feel that they could justify the continuance of a provision that specifically prohibits the importation of fictitious stamps from another member state either by reference to article 36 of the treaty or on any other ground of objective justification. We are, therefore, obliged to remove this restriction—hence the regulations. They form part of a wide range of single-market measures foreshadowed by my right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade in a written answer on 17 December last year. They were also the subject of a scrutiny debate in Standing Committee as recently as last Wednesday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.32 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Cousins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are debating a relatively obscure corner of the single-market legislation, albeit charming in its own way. The measure reflects a general switch from reliance on cross-border controls to reliance on internal policing and supervisory regulatory systems in this country, which lie behind the frontier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
The regulations would have passed unnoticed had we not experienced an extremely prolonged delay in the outcome of the Post Office review. I shall not dwell unduly on the matter, but I draw the Committee's attention to the controversial remarks of the Minister's predecessor in the columns of that august magazine, 	<i>The Spectator.</i> Not for the first time in its history, that magazine has been responsible for the minor undoing of various Government policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister explain how he proposes to police and supervise the system? What enforcement powers and regulations will be in place? At present, we rely on cross-border controls to monitor the position. On what shall we rely in future? Who will be the supervisors? Who will undertake the policing of the regulations? The measure is of particular significance in the light of the revelations by the Minster's predecessor that the Government intend to privatise the Royal Mail. Apparently, such an intention has already been made, and I place on record our anxiety that such matters have never in all these many weary months been reported to Parliament. Yet the Minister's predecessor made the Government's intention clear in the 	<i>The Spectator.</i> Now would be an appropriate time for the Minister, without declaring all the Government's hand in this respect, to refer to the matter, to suggest how that obscure corner of our regulatory system is to be policed and to say what the Government propose for the stamping systems of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our humble intention is to bring the matter to the attention of Parliament and we hope that the Minister will respond positively to some of our points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.34 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Benn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chesterfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have an interest in this matter as a former Postmaster General. I congratulate the Minister for reading with such clarity and skill a brief written not by his Department, but by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The instrument is interesting, apart from being signed by a Minister who has been sacked. The validity of the signature of the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) is a matter that the Law Officers will no doubt explain. However, the position in relation to the regulations is that we cannot import into the United Kingdom
	<br><blockquote><p>"fictitious postage stamps and dies, plates, instruments and materials for making them"</p></blockquote>
unless they have been produced in the European Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations preventing fictitious postage stamps, dies, plates and materials were introduced by a Conservative Government in 1953 for the good reason that forgery is a problem. However, it seems that forgery is all right as long as it comes from another member of the EC. Moreover, although it will still be illegal to have those items in this country—presumably, other countries have made the same regulations—it will not be illegal to export them to France. That is absolute nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations cause me to think of a range of problems, the first of which is subsidiarity. Is it necessary to allow
	<br><blockquote><p>"fictitious postage stamps and dies, plates, instruments and materials for making them"</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0208">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
to move freely? Is forgery to be protected by the treaty of Rome? Have we any power to defeat the instrument?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope to persuade the Committee, but I am not being controversial. Let us suppose that the Committee decided that the regulations were absolute nonsense and that the trade in forged postage stamps was not a desirable or necessary part of our move towards a federal Europe. As citizens of it as a result of the Maastricht treaty, one right that we never had before is that we can buy forged postage stamps from France and Germany. I know that the loyalty of the Whips is strong and that many members of the Committee will be moved not to reject the regulations by the prospect of knighthoods, preferment, peerages or invitations to royal garden parties. However, I urge the Committee seriously to consider the power that we are supposed to have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a feeling that if we were to turn down the regulations, those who favour fictitious postage stamps, dies, plates, instruments and materials could take this country to the European Court. The court might say, "We are sorry, you may have rejected the regulations but it is part of our duty in administering the new European Community to rule that you must have fictitious postage stamps in your country."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The instrument is not exactly earth shattering and is not as important as Lady Thatcher's motion tomorrow, but it has a bearing on the common-sense right of this or any other country in the Common Market to keep out those wretched, fraudulent products. To be candid, if the French decided that they wanted to stop fictitious postage stamps being imported from Britain, I would welcome that. I would regard it as a common-sense rule for the French postal authorities to use subsidiarity to their advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Committee to throw out the instrument. I know that the Minister has a subsidiary brief—I can see him using his highlighter to mark it. He will say that it is inherent in the referendum of 1975 that those products must be allowed to move to ensure the prosperity of Europe and that the Pacific rim countries are producing large numbers of fraudulent postage stamps which must be kept out. There comes a moment, even in this House which is a centre of ritual and ridicule, when we should say to the Minister, "Go away and think again about the matter."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To finish on the point on which I began, I am rather proud that, as Postmaster General, I played a part in introducing some decent postage stamps in Britain which were very popular. I introduced the first Churchill stamp in the philatelic bureau in Edinburgh, so I have an interest in ensuring that those awful frauds are kept out of the country. If I am told that they must come here because of the European Community, that will reinforce a certain prejudice into which I shall not go any further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Rowe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Kent)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having heard the right hon. Gentleman's opening remarks, I wonder whether his argument could be described as draining the cup of debate it its lees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether that was a point of order. My own view is that the right hon. Gentleman made a most entertaining and relevant contribution to the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.40 am</p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the first Standing Committee that I have attended since I have been at the Department of Trade and Industry. My officials told me that this was a non-controversial matter, but when I considered the people who had been appointed to this Committee, I felt that it might not be quite as straightforward as had been anticipated. The points that have already been raised by the right hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Benn) have gone some way towards demonstrating that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, the matter was foreshadowed, as I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman knows, in the response given by my right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade, who said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"So from next year there will be no importation or exportation offence for conterfeit currency, and fictitious postage stamps and the dies for making them as far as goods travelling between the United Kingdom and EC countries are concerned."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 17 December 1992; Vol. 216, c. 	<i>475.</i>]</p></blockquote>
That was part of a long and substantial reply by my right hon. Friend explaining the whole background to our position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To reply to the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins), I have made it clear that the Government have not yet concluded our review of the Post Office. At such time as the review is concluded, we shall of course make a statement to the House, as we have said on several occasions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Benn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister quoted the President of the Board of Trade. Forecasting nonsense from Ministers does not commit Committees to endorsing it. All that the Minister has said is that President of the Board of Trade, also advised by his officials, said that the change was bound to happen. That does not settle the matter; the matter is officially for us to decide, otherwise we should not have been summoned to the Committee at great inconvenience. I hope that the Minister is not saying that we have a duty to follow the forecast by the President of the Board of Trade of something that many may feel to be inherently absurd.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the right hon. Gentleman. I am sorry that he has been inconvenienced by attending Parliament; I should have thought that he felt that to be a duty placed on him by his election to the House. He says that there is nothing new in forecasting nonsense from Ministers; perhaps he has past experience of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman asked the reason for the regulations. The reason for them was foreshadowed in the written answer of my right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade. The other reason is that, whether he likes it or not, we are part of the Community. A referendum was held in which he took a substantial part and the outcome was that the British people endorsed our remaining part of the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the single market, as I have already said, the European Court of Justice takes a strict view on the need to achieve legal certainty by the removal of provisions of national law which appear inconsistent with Community law, even though it may seldom or never be necessary to rely on the offending provisions in practice. The Court has held that member states have an obligation to draft national laws that are unequivocal, so that they give persons affected a clear and precise understanding of their
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0209">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
Community rights and obligations. Where the language of a provision is contrary to the terms of article 30, the effect could be misleading and the member states will not have complied with the obligation of clarity, even if the removal of the provision will make little substantive difference to the legality of entering the country while in the possession of certain goods. That in no way changes clause 63 of the Post Office Act 1953, which I think was the piece of legislation to which the right hon. Gentleman referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Benn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is right to bring fraudulent postage stamps from France, Italy and other member countries, what is wrong with bringing them from other places, such as Indonesia, Nigeria, Costa Rica or Haiti? Why is the Minister so committed to the idea that fraudulence should be judged by its origin and not by its nature?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that the Committee decides to throw out the measure today—which I seriously hope it will—what will happen? Is this a fraudulent Committee which, in the Minister's opinion has no right to turn the proposal down because in 1975 the British people allegedly voted for the importation of fraudulent postage stamps? I do not recall the Prime Minister of the day, Mr. Wilson, or the Conservative party saying, "Vote for membership of the EEC so that these items can be imported from France and Germany." The Minister must be serious. Do we have the power to throw out these regulations? If we did so, what would happen?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have made my position perfectly clear. If the right hon. Member for Chesterfield wants me to make the points that I made earlier, I shall do so, but I think that I have covered them. The measure is a requirement under the single market, which has brought tremendous benefits to the country in terms of inward investment—even in the right hon. Gentleman's adopted county of Derbyshire, and not so far away in Nottinghamshire too. I can tell the right hon. Gentleman that this measure will not change section 63 of the Post Office Act 1953, which make these items illegal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is odd how often in Committee, when one starts to lift stones, especially if it is my right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield doing so, creepy-crawly things appear from under those stones. I have been fascinated by the past 20 minutes and I am curious to ask a question. To what extent has fraud been suspected in the past, let alone proved? Are we talking about how many angels there are on a pinhead, or about something that has happened? What evidence does the Minister's Department have about the amount of fraud or alleged fraud?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.47 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Olner 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nuneaton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am amazed by this morning's proceedings, and by the fact that we are being asked to approve regulations that will permit the importation of fictitious postage stamps and dies, plates, instruments, and so on to make such stamps, while it will remain illegal to have and to use such things in this country. It is nonsense to allow such illegal items to be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
imported. It is not only a silly argument, but it will set a serious precedent. The taking of particular substances in this country is deemed to be illegal. Is the Minister saying that if we accept this regulation, which sets a precedent, drugs could be imported without fear? It might be illegal to take them, but it would not be illegal to import them. I appreciate that the Minister has not wound up yet, but he did not give an adequate answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[Hon. Members: "He has wound up".]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must tell members of the Committee who are not au fait with its procedures that the matter can be debated for an hour and a half. The Minister can be asked to respond any number of times. After hearing members of the Committee saying that he has wound up, I can only say that he may have to wind up again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Olner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point is that the Minister did not respond adequately to the question posed by my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central about the policing of the importation of illegal items such as fictitious postage stamps.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.49 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was worried about being accused of making another winding-up speech and upsetting members of the Committee. I accept that there are grounds for the questions raised by the hon. Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Olner) and the right hon. Member for Chesterfield. The measure is designed to meet our obligations as far as the European Court may be concerned and under the single European market, which we consider important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will remain illegal to enter the United Kingdom with fictitious postage stamps because it remains illegal to be in possession of them. That is the simple point of the measure.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Nicholson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Taunton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend the Minister completes his second winding-up speech, will he clarify the point that he was making just before he sat down at the end of his first winding-up speech, with reference to section 62 of the 1953 Act? Will he confirm that there is nothing in the regulations concerning the importation of genuine postal stamps, services and so on into this country from abroad, and that the regulations apply only to fictitious items?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Taunton (Mr. Nicholson) may have misunderstood the section to which I referred. I was referring to section 63. I agree with my hon. Friend's summary of the position. Section 63 will remain in force.

On the question of policing, that will remain as it is under section 63 of the 1953 Act. Policing and enforcement will be carried out by the same agencies as at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Hoon 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ashfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The more I have listened to the debate, the more puzzled I have become. Initially,

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
I was content to allow the measure to proceed without challenge, but the more the Minister has explained it, the more confused I have become.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful if the Minister would explain the legal basis that makes the changes necessary. He referred to the Post Office Act 1953. I am not especially concerned about the United Kingdom aspect, but I do not understand why the European Court of Justice would require the change to be made in UK law. Moreover, if it is to be based on the concept of a single market, we need further explanation of the European basis of the proposal. Although I frequently disagree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield about European legislation, he is right to say that such a proposal lays the single market and the European Community open to proper criticism, such as he has made. The Minister should explain more precisely the European basis for the proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.53 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Benn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister tells us that it would be illegal to own fictitious postage stamps and so on in this country, but that it would not be illegal to import them. Importation is an act of human beings, so if someone arrives at Dover in a ship with fictitious postage stamps, it would not be illegal to import them, according to the new regulations, but it would be illegal for anyone in Dover to receive them. It would still be legal to import them. However, a product cannot be imported without being handed from one person to another. My first point, therefore, is that the position is absurd. If I went to Dover tomorrow and received a package of fictitious postage stamps, the act of receiving them would be importation and it would be illegal. It is a rottenly phrased measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point relates to the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Ashfield (Mr. Hoon). We have differed on the European Community, but I have never heard him argue that it is in favour of the promotion of fraud, so those differences do not matter much. However, let us suppose that the measure was not about fictitious postage stamps, but about fictitious bank notes and that the French had decided to print some pounds sterling—as they might well do. Before the ecu comes in, they might want to get their hand in with some new currency printed on their security presses. Presumably, another regulation would be introduced saying that we could import fictitious pound notes if they came from the EC, but not if they came from the third world. In that event, the Minister would say, "I am sure that the House will go along with the proposal because we have already agreed that fictitious postage stamps can come in, so why not fictitious bank notes?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the war, we printed German marks and dropped them by parachute into Germany to increase inflation as part of our economic warfare against that country. I always wished that the Germans had dropped a few pound notes on us in return as I would have found them very welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal is absurd and the recognition and defeat of absurdity must be one of the last remaining functions of the House of Commons, especially in relation to subsidiarity. When the Prime Minister went to Edinburgh, he defended subsidiarity vigorously, but did he say that subsidiarity would not prevent anyone in the Community from importing fictitious postage stamps?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
I ask the Minister to adjourn the Committee and to have further talks with his Post Office advisers, who are very decent people, and with the lawyers, who are doing their best. He should take the instrument away and not ask us to vote in support of it because when the record of the Committee's proceedings is available to people outside the House, it will do enormous damage to those who are in favour of the European Community. They will realise that one of its unexpected aspects is that we are encouraging the free movement of fictitious and fraudulent dies and stamps. The genuine articles are integral to the sovereignty of a country and it is no accident that bank notes are issued in the name of the Treasury or the Crown, and that postage stamps bear the imprint of the sovereign. We are discussing matters that go close to the heart of what is meant by a nation administering its own postal and financial services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we have made fun of the Minister, I ask him to take the proposal away and to tell us that he will return later with a new measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.57 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Member for Chesterfield for putting so much emphasis on the matter of subsidiarity, so I regret that he was unable to join us in the Lobby on the Third Reading of the Maastricht Bill because that will introduce—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must rule the Minister out of order. The Maastricht Bill has no relevance to the regulations, which relate to the Post Office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your ruling, Mr. Winterton. However, the right hon. Gentleman referred to subsidiarity and I was trying to point out to the Committee that it relates to the Post Office and to the regulations on which the right hon. Gentleman was questioning me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ashfield asked for an explanation of the legal base for the regulations. Their purpose is that we should comply with the obligations set out in article 5 of the treaty of Rome, in so far as it relates to the objectives set out in article 8A. Article 5 requires member states to facilitate the achievement of Community aims and to abstain from any measures that could jeopardise the attainment of the objectives of the treaty. Article 8A requires the Community to adopt measures with an aim of progressively establishing the internal market over a period expiring on 31 December 1992 and provides that the internal market shall comprise an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured in accordance with the provisions of the treaty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The free movement of goods is ensured in accordance with article 30, so member states are under an obligation to facilitate the achievements of the internal market and to remove any restrictions on imports, except in so far as they can be objectively justified consistent with article 30. Hence the amendment to section 63(5) of the Post Office Act 1953 which previously restricted the importation of
	<br><blockquote><p>"fictitious postage stamps and dies, plates, instruments and materials for making them".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Linlithgow asked about forgery. I can tell him that it is very limited and is not seen as
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0211">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
a huge problem. Policing will be carried out by police intelligence, as at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Forgery has taken place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not like to give a direct yes or no on that point. It is an illegal act, and illegal acts take place and are prosecuted. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman giving further information, as I cannot give a specific yes or no on that particular point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister enlighten us on the point raised by me and by my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow? Evidently there is a need to prosecute in this matter. Who are the prosecuting authorities? Have prosecutions been carried out as a result of border controls or under some other control, such as the Post Office Act 1953, to which the Minister has just referred, and which will still be in force?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman surely knows that we are referring to a criminal offence, so the prosecuting authorities are the police.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The detecting authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The detecting authorities and eventually the prosecuting authorities, depending on when the offence took place. If the hon. Gentleman wants further information on when such an offence last took place, I shall copy the reply that I have promised to send to his hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's explanation of that legal base, but I am troubled. The Minister cited the general provisions on free movement in the treaty as justifying the proposal. Such provisions are generally used to complement a directive that sets out a standard approach across the Community. Usually, such changes to national legislation are consequential on a specific directive. There are directives in the pipeline dealing with post office services, for example. My right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield properly said that if we were to accept this proposal, it would create a hole in European legislation, because if we change this part of our national legislation, we should create the possibility of an offence across the Community of importing such material.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the Minister will be in some difficulty if we change our national legislation and eliminate that offence. It is not possible for the European Community to pass criminal law. There is some debate about that, but the preferred opinion of the European Commission, which is supported by most member states, is that it is not possible for the European Community to create criminal offences. In creating the standards of a single market, it is difficult to see why we need to go as far as eliminating this piece of national legislation. That will not achieve the objective that is required by the single market—the free movement of persons and goods. There appears to be no justification for eliminating a criminal offence, which cannot be reinstated at European level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I ask the Minister to respond to that lengthy intervention, I must say that I hope that its
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
length will not be taken as a precedent by other members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was an intervention, so I hope that I shall be allowed to give the hon. Gentleman a longer response. I do not wish to repeat the points that I have made about the legal base. I take note of and respect the fact that the hon. Member for Ashfield has also served in the European Parliament and has taken interest in such matters. He is legally qualified, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am told that the provisions of article 30 are not dependent on the existence of any directive. They have a direct effect and, as the hon. Gentleman said, the Community has not competence to create a criminal offence. However, article 30 does not necessarily need a directive. The instrument's legal base is article 30. We believe that such an amendment is required. As the right hon. Member for Chesterfield said, the measure was signed by my predecessor who has made his views on the Community well known. He believed that it was required in terms of bringing forward the single market, and I consider that to be correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Benn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Winterton. I shall try to be brief. I served on the Council of Ministers for five years, and I was president of it during our presidency. I do not remember the Commission insisting that forgery should take place across the whole Community in the interests of free movement. After all, we are discussing forgery and let us not believe that the forgery of stamps and bank notes does not occur—it does. Will it be in order to move the Adjournment of the Committee, Mr. Winterton, so that the Minister can have further time to consider the serious arguments that have been advanced? I do not know whether that would be in order, given that it has been a long time since I was a member of a Committee that dealt with a statutory instrument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is in order to move the Adjournment of the Committee, I shall do so—and perhaps win the support of Conservative Members who may have different views—to allow the Minister to reconsider the matter. I cannot believe that anyone—even the most passionate Euro-federalist—either believes in forgery or believes that the free movement of forgery is an integral part of our move towards an integrated Europe. Furthermore, I do not believe that the Commission or the Council of Ministers has ever said that forgery must be free to move. In those circumstances, perhaps you would advise me, Mr. Winterton, whether it is in order to move the Adjournment. If it is not, I hope that the Committee rejects the regulations in the knowledge that they would return in a better form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be very unusual for the Chair to accept a motion to adjourn the Committee. Clearly, if the Minister sought leave to do so because of the contents of the debate, it would be more appropriate for me to consider allowing such a motion to be put to the Committee. At this stage, however, it would not be appropriate for me to accept a motion to adjourn the Committee, but I hope that the Minister has heard what the right hon. Gentleman said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Winterton. There is considerable evidence that such fraud is growing in significance because of the use of commercial
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0212">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
mailing as part of usual business activities, which has experienced a huge growth. The Minister has been unable to explain to us the policing of the matter and the extent of the problem. Yet he proposes in the regulations to remove an important control. I urge you to consider that point, Mr. Winterton.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am considering the matter. I said that it would be very unusual for the Chair to accept a motion from the Floor of the Committee to adjourn our proceedings. As the hon. Gentleman knows, I must be entirely impartial and act in accordance with precedents, whatever I may think of the debate. As much as I should like to outline my views to the Committee, I hesitate to do so. I am seeking advice from my Clerk to see whether there is a further precedent which can assist me. However, the look on his face shows that there is not. I am not sure whether the Minister will try to catch my eye so that he can make a further response to the comments made by the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central and the right hon. Member for Chesterfield. However, I must be guided by precedents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Benn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Winterton. We are dealing with one precedent already—the legalisation of forgery in the name of the European Community. I ask you to establish another precedent—namely, that an ordinary Back-Bench member of the Committee, such as I am, is entitled to move that the debate be adjourned. Clearly, you would only have to accept such a motion. It would be for members of the Committee to determine whether they wished to support it.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
I most earnestly ask you, Mr. Winterton, to accept a motion to adjourn, so that the Committee can reach a view without prejudice to what might happen to the regulations when the Minister has had a chance to consider the substantial arguments that have been put to him in the course of this morning's discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened extremely carefully to what the right hon. Gentleman said and I have looked at the Standing Committee procedures. Although I am somewhat confused by the debate that I have heard this morning and its relevance, sadly I see no reason why, as the Chairman of the Committee, I should accept a motion to suspend and adjourn the Committee. Therefore, without further ado, I must put the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
