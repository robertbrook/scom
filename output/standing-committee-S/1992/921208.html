Draft Road Traffic Regulation<br><br> Act 1984 (Amendment) Order 1993</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Roads and Traffic (Mr. Kenneth Carlisle)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 (Amendment) Order 1993.</p></blockquote>
It is a pleasure to appear before the Committee in this great Room, although it is rather daunting to have the august figure of my hon. Friend the Member for Littleborough and Saddleworth (Mr. Dickens) behind me.<br><br>
This deregulatory measure is welcome. It was asked for and the Government are glad to provide it.<br><br>
The order will devolve full responsibility for setting speed limits on principal roads to local traffic authorities. Local authorities had previously been required to seek the consent of the Secretary of State when setting a speed limit on such a road. This order removes that requirement.<br><br>
Principal roads are the most important roads for which a local authority is responsible and make up about 10 per cent. of the road network. They are non-trunk, A-roads and, although they form part of the local road network, many have been built to high standards and are often indistinguishable from trunk roads. Local authorities already have the freedom to set speed limits on all other local roads, without requiring the consent of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State.<br><br>
The proposal to abolish the requirement formed part of a consultation on the revision of the criteria for setting local speed limits. It was generally welcomed, particularly by the local authority associations. Removal of the requirement for consent will reduce the amount of work for local authorities in making speed limit orders and will also save the Department's time. About 150 principal road orders are processed by the Department each year which add two or three months to the normal six months taken to make an order.<br><br>
The Department has experienced aggravation and has received letters from hon. Members asking what on earth was the cause of the delay. It would, therefore, be a welcome move to reduce the time that the process takes.<br><br>
The requirement that local authorities receive the consent of the Secretary of State before setting speed limits on principal roads was established to ensure consistency in the setting of speed limits, both across the board and at the interface between local and trunk roads. However, the Department does not maintain control over speed limits on local roads that are not principal roads. Such roads comprise 86 per cent. of the total network. There is no evidence that that lack of control has resulted in the setting of widespread unsuitable limits. The Government are satisfied, therefore, that consistency can be maintained by
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
issuing guidance to local authorities on setting speed limits. We can, therefore, dismantle an unnecessary piece of bureaucracy.<br><br>
The order forms part of a wider package of measures, which give local authorities more freedom to exercise their judgment and local knowledge when they set speed limits. We have to respect that knowledge because local authorities know their road systems far better than us.<br><br>
If the Committee is content with the order, a circular will be issued revising the advice to local authorities on the factors that should be taken into account when considering the establishment of a local speed limit. The new advice recommends that more weight be given to the environment through which a road passes and less to the need to demonstrate that that road has a poor accident record. The proposed advice has been the subject of extensive consultation and has been widely welcomed.<br><br>
It has seemed wrong to us for a long time that it takes an accident on a stretch of road to prove that a lower speed limit is needed. I therefore welcome the additional weight that will be given to the importance of the environment.<br><br>
The proposals would result in some new speed limits but I caution against believing that there would be widespread changes. Doubtless many villages that have long pressed for a lower speed limit would re-submit their cases. However, in the vast majority of those, if a lower limit was inappropriate yesterday, it would probably remain so tomorrow. To be observed, speed limits must seem reasonable to motorists and it is wrong to assume that lowering a speed limit would automatically result in drivers going more slowly. On the contrary, there is, amazingly, some evidence that imposing too low a limit, without altering the engineering or shape of the road, can result in higher speeds. County councils regularly report examples where they have introduced a 30 m.p.h. limit in a village and, as a consequence, speeds have risen. It is clear, from that evidence, that speed limits are only effective if the majority of drivers regard them as reasonable. If they are set too low, drivers think them irrelevant and they are ignored.<br><br>
In such circumstances, before a lower limit can be introduced, it is necessary to alter the motorist's perception of the road environment to bring it closer to that of vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and children. We are working closely with a number of local authorities to develop new signing and highway engineering techniques which would permit the introduction of lower speed limits.<br><br>
That, of course, is only a small part of our programme of measures to reduce the huge number of road accidents caused by excessive speed. The programme includes traffic calming measures and 20 m.p.h. zones—which show great promise—improved enforcement using, for example, speed cameras and cameras at traffic lights, the compulsory fitment of speed limiters to heavy goods vehicles and persuasion through our continuing "Kill your speed, not a child" campaign which we ran quite successfully in the summer. All of that is beyond the immediate business of the Committee but I hope that members find it helpful to place the order in the wider context of speed policy on which we have a considerable number of initiatives.<br><br>
Not only would the order improve road safety by permitting local authorities to introduce better and more appropriate speed limits, but it represents a modest deregulation which would reduce bureaucracy and make local authorities more accountable for their own decisions.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0068">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
They employ highway engineers of the highest calibre and there is no reason why local decisions in that area should remain subject to central approval.<br><br>
There are many varied reasons to support the order. I have tried to put it in the context of an impressive policy to make our roads safer and to act upon excessive speed. I commend the order to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>4.39 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donald Anderson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Swansea, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like briefly to welcome the draft order and the Minister's clear exposition of it. I like the fact that it is a result of consultation and that it would simplify those procedures and paperwork that are the bane of local authorities. I fear that it might raise the unrealistic expectations of local residents in the same way as the traffic-calming measures, which people expected to be implemented on all their roads. Local authorities were quickly ready to inform residents of the resource implications of many of those measures.<br><br>
The Minister has broadly replied to the question that I was going to ask about the extent to which local authorities would be informed of the criteria to be used in modifying speed limits, but I should like his observations on one thought: what happens if local authorities are too zealous in respect of the measures? I understand the urge to say that local authorities know best but they could be tempted to yield to the demands of residents in a particular area. Those demands may ignore more strategic considerations and may not be reasonable under the terms of the order but,—dare I say it—to, curry favour with particularly vociferous groups the local authority might be too ready to reduce the speed limits. Is there a fall-back or sanction by which the Department can intervene if, in its opinion, the local authority is over-enthusiastic or over-zealous in considering the affairs of particular groups and ignoring wider considerations?</span></p>
<p>4.41 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Dickens <span class='memberconstituency'>(Littleborough and Saddleworth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the order because, as the Minister said, although certain measures may have been inappropriate for speeding yesterday, it does not necessarily follow that they are inappropriate today.<br><br>
By the same token, many local authorities improve the lines of roads, vision lines from junctions and highway lighting, which results in a balance being struck between the road being more attractive and conducive to the higher speeds that must, sometimes, be controlled, and the road being far more safe for higher speeds. Therefore, people on the ground—sometimes even the parish council—are those who should judge the circumstances and withstand the pressure of local residents.<br><br>
The order is a good step for local government—it gives it flexibility and takes power away from the Department. I hope that local government will respond and use the order sensibly, and I believe that it will. I congratulate the Minister on introducing the order, which is a good step.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Joan Walley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to put on the record the fact that this is the first Committee on which I have served under your chairmanship, Mrs. Winterton.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
This is the first time that I have heard the argument for deregulation presented as such, when what we are discussing seems more akin to decentralisation. Having said that, Labour Members welcome the order. It is modest but we feel that it is a useful extension of local authority discretion and that it should be supported.<br><br>
The removal of the need for the Secretary of State for Transport to approve speed limits on principal roads will help to ensure that speed is addressed as a key issue in local road safety strategies.<br><br>
I was interested in the Minister's comments about the amount of time that it takes the Department of Transport to process the 150 applications that are made each year. The order should be supported, not only because it reduces the amount of administrative time and burden spent on introducing the lower speed orders but because it can be clearly justified on environmental and safety grounds. That must be borne in mind. If 150 applications are currently processed by the Department of Transport, the order will unlock many more applications for the local authorities to deal with, which will have tremendous financial implications.<br><br>
The Opposition have often pressed for the Secretary of State's order-making powers to be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure instead of the negative resolution procedure. I have been advised that if the Secretary of State had decided to increase his controls on speed limits on local authority roads, the order would have been subject to the negative resolution procedure: we would have had the opportunity to debate the measure only if it had been prayed against. However, he has proposed sensible and widely-supported delegation of responsibility to local authorities, and that is subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. It is important to bring that to the Committee's attention.<br><br>
Whether we are in a new age of deregulation—we do not support that—decentralisation or subsidiarity, it is important to ensure that in future legislation close parliamentary scrutiny is focused on centralisation of powers and responsibility rather than deregulation and decentralisation.<br><br>
Conservative Members may be under the illusion that the order represents a massive increase in local authority responsibility for speed limits, so it is important to put the matter into context. Local authorities are already responsible for speed limits on 86 per cent. of the road network. The Secretary of State is responsible for speed limits on trunk roads and motorways, which form approximately 4 per cent. of the network. We are discussing the remaining 10 per cent. of local authority principal roads.<br><br>
Local authorities have used their powers to impose speed limits on the majority of the road network responsibly and I am confident that they will act similarly in future. The issues involved in dealing with speed limits on busier, more important roads are more complex than when dealing with local roads, but it is right that they should rest with the authority which is responsible for local transport and road safety policy.<br><br>
I note the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, East (Mr. Anderson). Many residents will want local authorities to put the views of pedestrians first. More attention is being paid to pedestrians than to motorists in traffic measures.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0069">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
The problem that concerns us is finance and resources. The Department of Transport consultation document, to which the Minister referred, preceded the order and raised two important points. It acknowledged that in some circumstances speed limits should be reduced for environmental and amenity reasons rather than on road safety grounds. It also stressed that the effectiveness of reduced limits is significantly increased if they are combined with engineering and traffic-calming measures. I support that, as do many of those who submitted evidence during the consultation procedure, including the local authority associations and the Parliamentary Advisory Committee on Transport Safety.<br><br>
Safety and environmental issues are at the nub of whether the order will be successful in bringing about traffic-calming measures. I was interested to hear the Minister say that it remains to be seen to what extent local authorities will accept that. We are approaching Christmas and the Minister's predecessors have sometimes announced the amount of money in the transport allocation on the day before Parliament went into recess. We are discussing a shift of transport policy and finance. What will the Treasury do in respect of the order, and how will the Minister account for the present imbalance whereby £18 billion is available for the roads programme but no money is available for local authority environmental and safety schemes?<br><br>
The Minister said that local authorities will not simply introduce a lower speed limit on specific roads or in specific areas. The Automobile Association, local authorities PACTS and others have told me that speed limits cannot be reduced without considering what engineering works are needed. Chicanes are not the only issue; new road signs may have to be considered. I had the privilege recently of visiting Sheffield and seeing the new road signs, which the Department of Transport has approved and which were designed by children, for a 20 m.p.h. limit. Traffic calming measures, traffic management and lower speed limits need a strategic response to local transport policies and money must be found for that.<br><br>
Those significant resource implications will not go away. I am sure that the Minister is aware that the main source of finance for traffic-calming measures is the road safety element of the transport supplementary grant. Despite the success of successive transport Ministers in increasing the size of the road safety budget, it remains oversubscribed. It will be more oversubscribed as a result of the order. What will the Minister do about that?<br><br>
The position in relation to measures with primarily environmental and amenity objectives is even more acute. They must be funded by headroom. When I joined the Opposition transport team, I was not clear what headroom was and in case some Conservative Members do not wish to admit that they do not understand it, I shall explain the concept. Headroom is that part of the resources available for local authority transport capital expenditure which is not directly tied to specific Government-sponsored schemes. In the current year, it represented only 7 per cent. of the total, yet the demands placed on it are enormous. As well as environmental traffic calming, they include all capital work other than road safety schemes on roads of only local importance, preparatory work for transport supplementary grant-supported schemes, most bus priority work and the provision of new street lighting.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
I am sure that the Minister is aware that the Parliamentary Advisory Committee on Transport Safety launched a campaign at the end of October for a bid to obtain £55 million of transport grants for local safety schemes. The TSG local safety schemes element for 1992–93 is £43 million and various local authority associations, who based their figures on what they believe is achievable, calculated that a minimum of £55 million will be needed.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will reply and that his intention is not to make the announcement on the day before the House rises for the Christmas recess—[<i>Interruption.</i>] One of my few achievements in the House has been to have water available in Committee Rooms.<br><br>
We do not want the Minister to announce two days before the recess that there will be no provision for the extra engineering, road safety and educational work that will necessarily go hand in hand with making local authorities responsible for implementing the orders. If the Government are unable to change the imbalance between £18 billion on major roads and no money for local roads, we might as well not waste parliamentary time discussing the order. I want an assurance that the Minister understands that extra resources will be needed. If the order is to be effective in helping local authorities and local people—residents, mothers and everyone concerned about the effects of high speed—and if we are going to reduce road casualties and carry out all other objectives of transport policy, it is essential that such points are taken account of, not just in today's debate but in the announcement of the amount of grant to be made available, which is due just before Christmas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Anthony Durant <span class='memberconstituency'>(Reading, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the Committee, but I should like my hon. Friend the Minister to answer a specific point of concern.<br><br>
If the order gives local authorities powers to impose speed limits, will it, equally, give them powers to take speed limits off?</span></p>
<p>4.56 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Carlisle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome this short, succinct debate on this important subject. I shall try first to answer the question asked by the hon. Member for Swansea, East, as I know that he has to leave soon.<br><br>
I understand what he said about unrealistic expectations. Until now, however, on principal roads, it has been easy for local authorities to pass all the burden of what might appear to be an ungenerous refusal, back to the Department. The order will ensure that responsibility lies with local authorities, which will have to face up to it. I have no doubt about their ability to do so because they already look after the speed limits on 86 per cent. of their roads with, to my knowledge, few complaints. They seem to do a good job in meeting their responsibilities. There should be no difficulties when the proportion of roads under their responsibility is increased by 10 per cent. to 96 per cent. Local authorities, after all, know of local circumstances and have highly skilled highway engineers. It is right to give them that additional responsibility. I do not think that they will be too zealous. Often, difficult decisions have to be made but their record shows that they can bear that responsibility.<br><br>
When we give powers, we do not retain the strings; we are not a nanny society, and the Conservative party does not want such a society. We want local authorities to get on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0070">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
with it. If they were to abuse their role, the House would have to reverse fully the authority which it is granting. We are prepared to trust local authorities and have full confidence in their ability to meet their responsibilities. The House has welcomed the measure and it is right to devolve that responsibility.<br><br>
Much to my relief, my hon. Friend the Member for Littleborough and Saddleworth also welcomed the scheme. I am grateful for that support. Both he and the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms. Walley) raised the role of engineering. It could be that engineering methods would have to be used hand-in-hand with speed limits. Obviously if a straight road passes through a built-up area people will not slow down just because a sign has been put up. There are many engineering methods which can reduce speed and we are examining many more. We have prepared documents to show what best practice is and what the best schemes of using it are. Much is being done in that area.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Walley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in the Minister's reference to best practice. How is the information about those schemes being made available? Does the funding and cost of those schemes go hand-in-hand with their description?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carlisle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Lady will know, we are experimenting with 20 m.p.h. zones to show which traffic-calming measures work in residential areas. We will publish the full results to spread the knowledge of that research to local authorities. The same applies to our research into speed in villages. We are monitoring measures in a number of villages and we will publicise the results when we know which measures work.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North always makes the same mistake as her party—she believes that everything needs money thrown at it. I agree that money helps, but there are many inexpensive methods. I was at a meeting today of local authorities from eastern region. One of the things that they wanted was the simple measure of painting roundels on roads with a large "30" on them. They had experimented with that and were certain that it was a good way of slowing down traffic as it enters a village. They told me that it would not cost much money. With intelligence and thought, much can be done without throwing money around.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dickens</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It might be useful to put it on record that the order includes the provision to impose, vary or cancel speed limits; the first of those would probably cost money but the other two would cost little. Resources do not always have to be thrown at measures provided for in an order or a Bill. Local authorities would have to manage within their resources and fix their priorities, as they always have.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carlisle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. The order would save the money spent on bureaucracy and would release more money for safety schemes.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carlisle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I answer the point about money available for safety schemes? I should like to welcome the hon. Lady's safety scheme, which is in Committee Rooms—it was useful to see it in operation this afternoon. I believe that the Government deserve great credit for making money available for safety schemes. We are the first Government to isolate money within the TSG which has to be spent on safety schemes. A range of schemes compete for that money and not all are expensive—some cost only a few thousand pounds, although some cost up to £100,000.<br><br>
In the current financial year, as the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North pointed out, the sum available is £43 million—an increase of 38 per cent. over the previous year. We will shortly announce the TSG for 1993–94. The hon. Lady will have to wait for that announcement, but I would not be surprised if people were not mildly pleased with our commitment to safety. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I are tremendously committed—as is the Department—to continuing our intitiative on safety and meeting the target that was set in 1985 of reducing all casualties by one third by the year 2000. That is an important part of our policy.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Minister for Reading, West (Sir A. Durant) is anxious to know whether speed limits could be raised as well as lowered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Anthony Durant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wondered whether they could be cancelled.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carlisle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Speed limits could be cancelled up to 70 m.p.h. or whatever the top level is for a particular road. Under the order, the county council would have the authority on 96 per cent. of roads—not trunk roads—to change speed limits. The county council will consult local people and will be fully aware of what my hon. Friend says in, for example, the Reading area on those matters. We are glad that the county council will have such authority because that is right for local government. That is why I welcome the order and commend it to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p><i>That the Committee has considered the draft Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 (Amendment) Order 1993.</i></p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Committee rose at five minutes past Five o'clock.</i></p>
