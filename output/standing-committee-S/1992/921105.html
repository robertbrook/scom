Draft Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act 1990 (Modification) Order 1992</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Michael Jack)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act 1990 (Modification) Order 1992.</p></blockquote>
The amendment to the Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act 1990, which this draft order proposes, represents a small, but nonetheless important, step in the continuing fight against drug trafficking.<br><br>
The order seeks to bring under the control of the 1990 Act an additional 10 precursor and other chemicals that are essential to those who illicitly manufacture controlled drugs. It does so by adding them to schedule 2 of the Act. The order is needed for us to comply with the United Kingdom's treaty obligations under the 1988 United Nations convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. It seeks to implement decisions taken earlier this year by the United Nations commission on narcotic drugs, which in turn stemmed from a recommendation of the international chemical action task force. That was established by the Group of Seven most industrialised countries at its 1990 Houston summit and was in response to much concern expressed by some Latin American countries that have a serious drugs problem.<br><br>
Before describing the purpose and effect of the order, it might help the Committee if I were to say a few words about the background to the 1990 Act. Provisions in it relate to the control of precursor and essential chemicals. Although the United Kingdom, in common with some other countries, has monitored the trade in precursor chemicals for upwards of 20 years, until recently that was done in a covert manner. It was dependent upon the voluntary co-operation of the chemical industry in bringing to notice suspicious orders and transactions involving the principal chemicals used in the production of amphetamines and other drugs manufactured illicitly in the United Kingdom. The assistance that we have received from the chemical industry has been, to say the least, absolutely magnificent. It has led to the detection of many illicit laboratories. I could go so far as to say that, in this country, we have the best possible co-operation in the world with our chemical industry on such matters. I take this opportunity to put on record my appreciation for the work that it has done.<br><br>
In the 1980s, it became clear that suspicious reporting was not sufficient in itself to prevent the diversion of chemicals to illicit drug production. That was especially true in relation to the international trade in the fairly
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
common chemicals used in the production of heroin and cocaine, the bulk of which are manufactured in Europe and north America. At the end of 1988, the international community took a major step forward in controlling precursor chemicals when it adopted the 1988 United Nations convention against illicit drug trafficking.<br><br>
In broad terms, the convention requires parties to take appropriate measures to prevent the diversion of 12 scheduled substances to illicit drug manufacture, and to co-operate with one another to this end. It establishes as criminal offences the manufacture or supply of scheduled substances knowing or suspecting that they are to be used in the unlawful production of controlled drugs. The 1990 Act gives effect to the relevant parts of the convention, which the United Kingdom ratified in June 1991.<br><br>
I am not a chemist—<i>[Interruption.]</i> Perhaps I am glad that the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) shares my problem—and I hope that the Committee will forgive me if I do not give it a detailed explanation of the chemistry of each of the substances to be brought under control. However, I shall attempt to do that in broad terms.<br><br>
Paragraph 2 divides the 10 chemicals into two groups: the five which are to be included in table I of schedule 2 to the 1990 Act, and the five which are to be included in table II. The substances in the first group, like all the substances in table I, are precursor chemicals in the scientific sense of that term. That means that they are effectively incorporated into the drug molecule which is required for a particular drug synthesis. In layman's terms, one could say that those substances are but one step removed from the drugs themselves. The first of the new substances, -N-acetylanthranilic acid, is used in the production of the controlled drug methaqualone. The other four—I hope the Committee will excuse me if I do not read them out—are precursors for the group related to MDMA, or ecstasy as it is more popularly known. Right hon. and hon. Members will be aware of the increasing use of that drug in the United Kingdom and the fact that its illicit manufacture takes place both here and in mainland Europe.<br><br>
The five substances to be placed within table II are chemical solvents and reagents, and have a much wider commercial use. The chemicals that we are seeking to bring under control in this category are hydrochloric acid, methyl ethyl ketone, potassium permanganate, sulphuric acid and toluene. They are used widely in processing heroin and cocaine as well as synthetic drugs.<br><br>
What will be the effect of the order on United Kingdom legislation? Its immediate effect will be to bring the 10 substances within the scope of the provision in section 12 of the 1990 Act. That makes it an offence for a person to manufacture a scheduled substance; or to supply such a substance to another person, knowing or suspecting that the substance is to be used in or for the unlawful production of a controlled drug. The maximum penalties which may be imposed for this offence on indictment are 14 years' imprisonment or a fine, or both.<br><br>
These measures should also be seen in the context of Europe-wide developments. The Community is party to the 1988 United Nations convention and has competence in relation to trade aspects of precursor chemicals.<br><br>
The European Commission and seven member states participated fully in the work of the chemical action task force. In addition to the proposals for scheduling the 10 additional substances, the CATF made recommendations for regulating the international and domestic trade in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0254">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
precursor and essential chemicals and in developing effective enforcement measures for preventing the diversion of scheduled chemicals. The Community has already taken steps to implement the regulatory recommendations. A regulation implementing them in relation to trade between the Community and third countries will come into force on 1 January 1993. This has been widely welcomed by the countries in Latin America and Asia where cocaine and heroin are a major problem. A directive regulating the intra-Community trade is expected to come into force on 1 July 1993, and that should be of considerable help to the law enforcement agencies in preventing and detecting the illicit manufacture of synthetic drugs within the Community.<br><br>
That is the background against which the proposal in the order should be seen. I have described it in some detail because I hope that the Committee would wish to be aware of the development of international co-operation in such an important area. As I said, some of the chemicals have wide legitimate commercial use and are traded in vast quantities. For that reason, we have sought the advice and co-operation of the chemical industry throughout the negotiations. Our intention is to make life as difficult as possible for the illicit drug manufacturer while at the same time not placing unnecessary burdens on the industry. I think that we have achieved that balance.<br><br>
I therefore commend to the Committee the changes proposed in the draft order.</span></p>
<p>10.38 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition accept the intentions that are set out in the order and the Minister may be assured of our support in dealing with the control of the trade and in complying with our international agreements.<br><br>
It is about two years since the measure was introduced from which the statutory instrument arises. We are dealing with an unacceptable trade in which changes occur speedily, so there is a need for the United Kingdom and the international community to act quickly to ensure that the right substances are being checked and monitored.<br><br>
The Minister said that such monitoring has been carried out in a covert way, and it is healthy that that should now be out in the open. That is welcomed, but I am sure that he would agree that there is a greater need for speed and flexibility, which are not always characteristic of the procedures of the House of Commons. I ask the Minister to tell us whether his Department is monitoring the current use of substances and the developments that now take place so as to deal with what is happening and to look ahead. Given the speed with which new avenues are found when others are closed, it is important that the House of Commons is able to respond quickly.<br><br>
The Minister said also that many of the substances with which we are dealing have wide legitimate uses, and he hoped that we could strike the right balance between placing requirements and obligations on companies and not interfering with their legitimate business. I am sure that the principle is right, but can he tell us how that system will operate and what notification requirements will be placed on local authorities and Government agencies? As such common substances are involved, it is important that we should understand the relevant mechanisms and where responsibilities lie.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
It has not been clear in recent years whether the Government are taking responsibility for monitoring and communication with other countries, especially those in Europe. I should be grateful if the Minister were to clarify the matter.<br><br>
The extent of the trade that that information would help to control is considerable. It is estimated that between 100,000 and 200,000 young people are using ecstasy and similar drugs each weekend, and the problem is growing rapidly in many areas. There is also evidence that these drugs have attracted young people who have not previously been involved in the drug scene and do not seem to regard ecstasy as a serious drug, which it is, with dangerous side effects.<br><br>
A matter of grave concern is that tablets sold as ecstasy have often contained other very dangerous substances of which the purchaser will normally be completely ignorant. Heroin, ketamine—which is an anaesthetic—and even dog-worming tablets have been found mixed in tablets purporting to be ecstasy. In seeking to control the substances that are being used in their manufacture, have those elements been taken into consideration? In other words, is the Minister taking into account in his discussions with other countries—which I appreciate is the background to the statutory instrument—these dangerous practices in an unacceptable trade? I understand that people directly concerned with the way in which the trade operates are particularly worried about that aspect.<br><br>
We are discussing the use of particular substances and their movement. Given the flexibility of travel, the boundary changes within the European Community and the prospect of the channel tunnel, the movement of such substances across boundaries is an important matter, as is the need for communication about their use and transportation.<br><br>
I ask the Minister to tell us how that traffic is to be regulated in the new circumstances in Europe. There is worry about the reduction in the number of Customs officials at a time when there may be a need for an increase. That seems curious in view of the changes in border controls. There is a need for clear communication between agencies of central Government, local government, police authorities and the relevant authorities in the countries of our European partners, where often mechanisms and organisational structures will not match one another. Perhaps the Minister could clarify how the system will work. Who will be responsible for ensuring not only that the information is collected and that monitoring takes place but that it is used to good effect and for effective communication between ourselves and our partner countries, primarily in Europe but also outside European boundaries?</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Powell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Corby)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will be relieved to know that I do not intend to divide the Committee. I begin by declaring an interest. I am a member of the bar; until about five years ago, I practised daily in our criminal courts. I have substantial experience of drugs trials and the administration of the criminal law in this context. The Committee will also be relieved to hear that my only financial interest now is in seeking the payment of fees which are due to me from many years ago and which are still outstanding.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0255">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
I much welcome what the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) said. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister will give the hon. Gentleman a full answer.<br><br>
I am concerned about international co-operation. The habit in Europe—not only in Europe—is to try to proceed to the administration of criminal justice through treaties. We are always told and, if I give him the slightest opportunity, my hon. Friend the Minister will say that co-operation between the authorities in this country and other countries is absolutely outstanding and that there are no impediments to the successful prosecution in our courts of those engaged in the criminal trafficking of drugs. However, he has no experience of practising in the criminal courts; I have and can tell my hon. Friend that any such view is entirely mistaken. There are enormous difficulties in securing the attendance of witnesses, the reliability of evidence, and so on, in our courts. Indeed, our courts have received a substantial blow to their international prestige because of the wrongful conviction of several people, which has received enormous international publicity.<br><br>
Although the order is a useful and limited measure, it is not the true answer to the problem that we all seek to tackle: how do we ensure that international criminals and gangsters are brought effectively to justice and receive their just desserts for the trade in death which they carry out on such a remorseless and ruthless scale? Each member of the Committee knows that many scores of such villains walk free across the continents of the world beyond the grip and the grasp of law enforcement agencies and, one can bet, beyond the jurisdiction of our criminal courts. I, for one, find that increasingly unacceptable.<br><br>
The Committee will be relieved to know that in other countries—alas, not in Great Britain—the issue is being taken increasingly seriously. I pay tribute to Governments in European and non-European countries who have taken the lead in trying to establish a permanent machinery of criminal jurisdiction that will enable such people to be tried internationally, so to speak, rather than in the national courts of one or another country, with all the difficulties of extradition, of securing witnesses, of admissibility of evidence under different laws of evidence, and so on. Enormous progress is being made to ensure that such a tribunal can be established.<br><br>
Events in Yugoslavia and elsewhere have helped to crystallise the mind on the need to punish international criminals. There is no reason why an international criminal tribunal—which would be enabled and empowered to deal with matters contained in the order— should be confined merely to the politically highly sensitive issues of war crimes or abuse of human rights of that sort. Of course, it should be empowered and able to deal with the ordinary parameters of the criminal law, to deal with people who, in effect, for one reason or another, are beyond our own jurisdiction.<br><br>
I pay tribute to the pioneering work of Professor M. Cherif Bassiouni, professor of law at De Paul university, Chicago. He is generally recognised in nearly every country as the world's leading authority on international criminal law. His draft convention for the establishing of an international tribunal is being considered by the General Assembly of the United Nations in this session of the United Nations.<br><br>
The legal problems involved in ensuring that criminals can be brought to justice have already been solved to the greatest possible extent. All that is needed is a political
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
trade-off at the margins between various countries to establish an appropriate convention under the authority of the United Nations.<br><br>
Unfortunately, the political will is not there. I know that it will be a crushing blow to my hon. Friend the Minister when I say that the political will is weakest in this country. That is unacceptable.<br><br>
I was delighted that during Prime Minister's Question Time last week, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister gave an answer to me which suggested that the United Kingdom would be much more forthcoming and helpful than hitherto about the establishment of such a tribunal. I suspect that in the cut and thrust of Prime Minister's Question Time my right hon. Friend was unaware of the dusty, arid answers given to me time and again by Ministers in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister can reassure me that the view of Her Majesty's Government will be that apparently expressed by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister last week, rather than the more traditional and arid approach which has hitherto applied.<br><br>
We can draw up convention after convention, but they will all be effectively and ultimately useless in getting at the criminals whom we all want to reach unless we are prepared to take a more co-operative international view. The issue is very important for this Parliament and for this country. I was delighted that Professor Bassiouni—unknown in this country—lectured at Chatham house in the summer. However, virtually no work is being carried out in our universities or anywhere else to advance the cause. The Committee will be pleased to know that next month there will be a conference at the Institute of Study for Higher Studies in Criminal Sciences at Siracusa in Sicily, under the chairmanship of the former Prime Minister of Italy. Also participating will be the Foreign Minister of Canada and many other international figures of such status. It will take the matter a little further. Great Britain will not be represented at that conference in the usual way. As I have said, the matter is most important.<br><br>
I wish to ask my hon. Friend the Minister two questions. Time and again, we are brought here on Wednesday or Thursday mornings to deal with an uncontroversial order which has virtually no political substance, but which is dealt with under the affirmative procedure. No one can recall why the affirmative procedure was provided for in the parent statute. On this occasion I ask yet again whether my hon. Friend can tell me why an order such as this requires the affirmative procedure rather than the more usual negative procedure, which can be used to handle such matters more quickly than is otherwise so? Secondly, have my hon. Friend and his department referred this matter to the Select Committee on Home Affairs, which is supposed to have several members who are much more expert in these matters than we are and who could perhaps express a view on the matter that it based on the totality of our criminal legal system.<br><br>
This is a modest but important order and I do not intend to divide the Committee on it. The sooner it becomes law, the better.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be helpful to the Committee if I point out that I have been very tolerant and allowed the remarks of the hon. Member for Corby (Mr. Powell) to go
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0256">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
wider than the substance of the order. It would be helpful to the Committee if hon. Members kept their remarks to a more limited base.</span></p>
<p>10.55 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Spearing <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall endeavour to obey your invitation, Mrs. Winterton, and concentrate my remarks on the substances referred to in paragraph 2. If I do not refer to them explicity, I hope that you will accept, Mrs. Winterton, that my speech will be founded on those named substances and on their use, manufacture, recording and movement. I hope to keep well within the terms that you have properly outlined. The Committee, the House of Commons and the public should be grateful to you, Mrs. Winterton, for your tolerance and to the hon. Member for Corby (Mr. Powell). Members of Parliament are so often blamed when something goes wrong in society. People ask: "When was that law passed? Was it badly drafted? What was the order about and was it adequate?" We, as Members, properly share some of the blame if things go wrong.<br><br>
Committees such as this are wholly undervalued—even by some other hon. Members, and certainly by the media, representatives of which may or may not be present. One can write acres about drugs, their movement and control, but that depends upon legislation, which is not always scrutinised as it should be.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Corby outlined a disturbing picture. As a lawyer, he omitted one matter, which, perhaps, he will inform us of later or informally. I refer to evidence for the lack of political concern. However, the hon. Gentleman, with his knowledge, has good cause for what he said and for not being explicit.<br><br>
I with to draw the Committee's attention to three aspects of the order. The first is the explanatory note; the second is the degree of use of the substances or their potential use within society and how we can deal with that. The hon. Member for Corby referred to the detection of the wrongdoer, but we must also consider users and the number of them. The third aspect is to follow up the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) about movement, and that could be the most pressing issue that we must face.<br><br>
I am a particular person with regard to explanatory notes. When they were introduced into the House, it was intended that any reasonably informed person could read them and understand what they were broadly about without the necessity to read the legal material relating to the substances referred to in the order. Over the years, I have noted a tendency for the explanatory notes produced in Whitehall to become more technical and less explicit. The Minister is responsible for accepting the explanatory note in the order, and he should have sent it back. There may be people within earshot who were responsible for drafting the note, and if I am critical of it they will understand that I speak in the spirit of democracy. Surely, the explanatory note should have told us the purpose of the Act on which the order is based and outlined the powers that are contained in it. It is necessary only to outline the powers that relate to the addition of the substances to schedule 2.<br><br>
I understand from the order that it relates to powers in section 12 of the Act, which states that such substances must not be manufactured. However, section 13 adds that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
if the substances are manufactured, proper records must be kept of their use and transaction. It would not have been difficult to insert a couple of sentences—or perhaps one with a semi-colon—to that effect, but they do not appear in the explanatory note. We must dig in to the Act to discover that relatively simple sequence of information. I had hoped that it would appear in the explanatory note, but it does not. I draw that to the attention of drafters of future explanatory notes and to Ministers who accept them too easily. The note could also have explained why there is a need to add the substances to the Act. Of course, I do not suggest that there is no need to do that. The more of the substances that are at the margin that are included in the Act, the better. However, the Act came into force in 1990, so in the past two years something must have happened. Either it was not thought necessary, for some good reason, to include the substances in the Act in 1990, or something has occurred since then that requires their addition.<br><br>
The explanatory note should have contained some reasons why it is now necessary to add the substances to the Act. Has it been a request of other nations that they are included? From the remarks of the hon. Member for Corby about our lack of action, it could be that the initiative came from elsewhere. Is the inclusion a result of something that the police or the Home Office laboratories have discovered? Although not essential, it would have been helpful if the explanatory note had referred to the reason.<br><br>
My second point deals with the use of the substances before and after manufacture and with their detection. As a nation we are aware of the successes of the police in detecting manufacturing laboratories in the past five years. They have had some spectacular results and apprehended some of those responsible. However, I must say to the hon. Member for Corby that, as much as we admire the skills of the law in that respect, if prosecutions are brought that is, at best, a deterrent. We must consider the roots of the use of such substances.<br><br>
There is plenty of profit in the manufacture of such substances, and we must be clear about the difference between the legitimate use for proper manufacturing and pharmaceutical purposes and their leakage for improper use, as sometimes occurs, from the cabinet of a doctor or a district nurse. That is the homely comparison. If we take the matter in extremis, the use of weedkiller to produce explosions would be comparable. However, the misuse of such substances is far more corrosive to society even than the incidence of explosions, be they far or near. We all know that the misuse of such substances corrodes society, families and personalities.<br><br>
I represent an urban constituency in London and I understand from those well qualified to know that in urban areas throughout London and, perhaps, in others the degree of the use of drugs, including substances referred to in the order, is much greater than most of the so-called establishment—that means us—suspect or know. It is impossible to reach a firm statistic, but we have an estimate that is based on a number of observations, particularly, alas, among the young.<br><br>
The knock-on effect on people who use such substances and their derivatives and who have become dependent on them, include pressure on families and criminal activity. That includes theft for quick money and the threat to "throw you in the river" or to harm a person, his sister or other members of his family if he does not provide the £200
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0257">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
that he owes before the end of the week. Those knock-on effects and the cycle of drug dependence, its use and manufacture, which is found in other parts of the world, could begin to develop in parts of this country if they have not already done so. I shall not pursue that matter because it would take me away from consideration of the substances, but I do not know the extent to which such matters are properly understood in the House other than through the Select Committee on Home Affairs.<br><br>
My third point relates to movement. As I believe all my colleagues in the House know, I am an enthusiastic internationalist. That is why I hold views on other legislation before the House. The 1990 Act and the international convention of Vienna are first-rate examples that show how civilised nations must act together for the common good.<br><br>
We need the Minster to tell us what will happen in relation to the possible movement of substances from one nation to another, especially with the European Community as it is and as it might be, given the prospect of European Free Trade Association countries having a form of associate membership. From 1 January 1993, there will be an easement in the manner of entry and exit across what a certain document calls internal frontiers, and I imagine that there will not be stricter examination of persons suspected of carrying substances. There may not be a complete relaxation of controls, and I believe that there are discussions on that matter between the Home Office and the European Commission. The European Court may also be involved, but the controls will not be strengthened. Therefore, I ask the Minister to tell us what impact any diminution of the controls—I suspect that that will occur from 1 January 1993—will have on the movement of substances between member states of the European Community, and especially in and out of places of entry in the United Kingdom.<br><br>
It is unlikely that many of the substances will be carried in bulk by people but they may well enter in bulk by other means. Some of them may be carried in container lorries and tanks and some may enter, quite legitimately, for industrial purposes.<br><br>
That brings me to my second point in relation to the Community law that will come into effect on 1 January 1993, namely the way in which the inspection of manufacture and the recording of transactions in respect of sections 12 and 13 are carried out in the other member states of the Community. Do all members of the Community adhere to the Vienna convention—I suspect that they do—or does the Community as a common commercial unit adhere to it separately?<br><br>
We know of treaties whereby something is done for the whole of the Community on behalf of all member states, and of those to which member states, as well as the Community, adhere. There are some areas to which only certain states adhere, so I should like to know what our position is in that regard.<br><br>
Another matter is the extent to which there is equivalence of operation. Is there harmonisation across the Community of the provisions for inspection and documentation of manufacture that are found in sections 12 and 13? Unless there is, adding these substances will not do very much. We should be informed about that.<br><br>
My third and last point is not about what will happen from 1 January 1993. There is already Community law relating to the single market, but contributions to recent debates by some hon. Members have shown that they do
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
not understand that we are members of the Community and that the single market will arrive on 1 January, come what may. I am interested in what the position might be in the event of enactment of the treaty of European unionl. Under article K, which deals with home and justicial affairs, a new pillar of international co-operation was introduced by the Foreign Secretary, and he is very proud of it. I understand that it is called the Trevi range of agreements. Does this matter come under the Trevi arrangement and is it an open matter? A criticism of the arrangement is that it has been arrived at confidentially and not in public.<br><br>
The Minister may not be able to answer some of my points immediately, and I understand that. However, the legislation has not been sprung upon us; we have known about it for a year or more, so I should think that the Home Office will at least have some ideas of its consequences.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister can answer some of my questions. He may wish to comment on the other matters that I have raised en passant. If he cannot provide answers, I am sure that he will assure the Committee that he will write to me in due course and send copies of the correspondence to other members of the Committee.</span></p>
<p>11.10 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Stephen <span class='memberconstituency'>(Shoreham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fully support the draft order and I shall vote for it. The efficacy of any legislation depends on the means that exist to catch and bring to trial the criminals responsible for the evil and disgusting trade with which the order is concerned.<br><br>
With regard to the apprehension of those criminals, I welcome the valuable work done by the Trevi group and I look forward to increasing international co-operation on an intergovernmental basis within the European Community.<br><br>
I, too, am a barrister, and in the early 1970s I was one of the United Kingdom's representatives on the legal committee of the General Assembly of the United Nations. At that time, it was apparent to us that there was no sufficient mechanism for bringing to justice large-scale international criminals, and we began to think about the matter then. I am sorry to say that the General Assembly is still thinking about it some 20 years later.<br><br>
I am also a member of the Royal Institute of International Affairs. Although I was unable to attend the lecture given by Professor Bassiouni, who is, of course, an acknowledged expert on international criminal courts, I obtained a tape recording of his lecture and have listened to it with great interest. However, I advise my hon. Friend the Member for Corby (Mr. Powell) that, having listened to that lecture, I am by no means convinced that all the legal difficulties have been overcome. On the basis of that lecture and my own experience, I know that serious legal difficulties must be dealt with.<br><br>
Some months ago, I tabled a question to Foreign Office Ministers and raised the same matter during the emergency debate in the summer recess on whether the United Kingdom would press for the establishment of an international criminal court. It was my advice that we should entrust that duty to the International Court of Justice, which was established by the charter of the United Nations for that purpose. With suitable amendments to its statute, it could try individuals and establish regional divisions of the court in those parts of the world where the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0258">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
problem is most prevalent. I have not yet received a satisfactory response from either the Foreign Office or the Home Office.<br><br>
I urge Foreign Office and Home Office Ministers to encourage the establishment of a working group of Members who have special experience to ascertain whether the United Kingdom can take the lead in establishing an effective system of international criminal justice.</span></p>
<p>11.13 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been a timely and wide-ranging debate on the addition of the substances in the order to the base legislation. Within the confines of the order, I shall do my best to reply to some of the points raised by members of the Committee.<br><br>
I welcome the support that all members of the Committee have given to the substance of the proposition, and I particularly welcome the remarks of the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael). The hon. Gentleman spoke about monitoring, speed of change and whether we were keeping up with developments. That thought underlined some of the other comments that we heard.<br><br>
The United Kingdom is a leading member of the chemical action task force. Part of the reason why we have had those substances added is the result of intense discussions within that internationally based forum about identifying the new substances that are being used in the illicit manufacture of drugs. Plainly, there had to be a balance between including everything that had been identified and controlling the principal new additions to the original list. The chemical action task force continues its monitoring function.<br><br>
In the context of the effectiveness of our own enforcement, hon. Members may know that we recently opened a new headquarters for the National Criminal Intelligence Service. That service carefully monitors what is happening in this aspect of criminal activity and, bluntly, what is happening on the street. One of the best indicators about new chemical substances getting into drugs is what is being sold. Substances are subject to regular analysis and that forms a basis of our input into the chemical action task force. That is effectively a worldwide-based organisation in which we play a leading part. I hope that my reply answers the hon. Gentleman's question.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth asked for clarification of notification. It is essentially simple. Such matters must be notified to the Home Office. In effect, this legislation requires, and the new European legislation will require, that the Home Office should be notified or involved in subsequent licensing arrangements which various parts of the EC legislation will introduce.<br><br>
I share the worries of the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth about ecstasy. He is absolutely right. Perhaps on another occasion we shall debate the chilling new evidence of ecstasy being a killer drug.<br><br>
European co-operation was mentioned by the hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing). In his close and detailed study or analysis of the subject, the hon. Gentleman will no doubt have noticed that there are distinctions between areas regulated by the Community in terms of trade. He will also have seen that the newer regulations will ultimately deal with intra-Community
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
traffic in these substances, as well as controlling traffic from the Community to third countries. The hon. Gentleman will have noticed that the intelligence-gathering side of control of drugs and substance movement is handled outside the scope of the Maastricht treaty under the new arrangements of the interior and justice pillar; it will not be handled as such by Trevi. However, I recommend the hon. Gentleman to investigate the early work that has been carried out on Europol. He will probably find the answer there. I hope that I have answered the questions of the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Notification in a local area is plainly not for the Home Office, or is it? In respect of communications between this country and other countries, are they between the Home Office and relevant departments overseas or through another mechanism?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We must be entirely clear about what we are doing today; we are adding substances to a list. If people in the chemical industry or others become involved in knowingly passing them on to people in the illicit drugs trade, the law will apply. As for the present arrangements of notification and future licensing under EC arrangements, the Home Office alone will be the central and competent authority for notification and action. Clearly, information passes out from the Home Office. It may be wondered why all such information is recorded and whether it is simply kept in a file. The recording enables the law enforcement authorities, both of police and of Customs, to identify legitimate and illegitimate consignments. As I indicated, that type of information is passed to the National Criminal Intelligence Service.<br><br>
Even the existing arrangements have been very successful. With the voluntary reporting arrangements of the chemical industry, about 23 out of 35 illicit laboratories discovered have come through the present notification procedure. It is not an academic exercise that does not work; it has delivered real gains.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Corby (Mr. Powell) gave us an interesting insight into aspects of international jurisprudence. I admire the forcefulness with which he delivered his message, but I cannot entirely share his criticism that there is no political will. As always, there may be differences of opinion about how matters should be handled. However, let us consider the base legislation in this country: the Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1986, the Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act 1990 to which we are adding further substances today and the Criminal Justice Bill which started its passage through the House of Lords the day before yesterday. All clearly illustrate a determination to act and to bolster the international arrangements, part of which are referred to in the order.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Corby asked why it was necessary to use the affirmative procedure. As we are changing primary legislation, the House should deal with the matter. If my hon. Friend reads the detail of the new Criminal Justice Bill, which is presently in another place, he will find a small but important improvement that relates to other matters in this area and covers changes from affirmative procedure to the negative resolution. A little study of the detail may be to my hon. Friend's advantage.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Newham, South made some interesting comments. I share his concerns about drugs on the street, and that is why the Home Office has its drug
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0259">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
prevention initiatives. I hope that some of the work that is going on in south London will be of benefit to his area and to his constituents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have heard that there is a likelihood that some of the funding from his Department will, as a result of current considerations, be reduced. I hope the Minister can assure me that that—either directly or indirectly—is not the case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Gentleman about the terms on which the drugs prevention initiatives began. They were started as an experimental activity for us to evaluate new ways of dealing with drugs on the street. They were set up with initial three-year lives, and that was clearly defined. We have a major evaluation exercise built into that programme to enable us to determine, first, what is effective. I do not wish to trespass beyond that, but I shall write to the hon. Gentleman on that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If we were to stray too far, you, Mrs. Winterton, would call us back to the content of the order. However, in view of the Minister's comments, the order and all other measures relating to drug use and trafficking must be taken together. The Minister has referred to one project, but one of the problems is that projects are allowed to fall by the wayside without their lessons being incorporated into a national strategy. Although this is not the place to debate that further, I share the concern of my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing). We have questioned the Minister on that and we shall be pressing him strongly to ensure that it is a requirement that lessons should not just be learnt, but should be incorporated into a national approach that works and deals with the problem in all parts of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for marking my card for future attractions. I note that, but I refer him to a Conservative party manifesto commitment which covers his central point.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
The hon. Member for Newham, South referred to the explanatory memorandum. I would never claim that what one puts before hon. Members is perfect. I have listened to and learnt from what he said. I think that the memorandum points forward, but I shall try to incorporate his observations into any similar future productions.<br><br>
In the latter part of his speech, the hon. Member for Newham, South made wide-ranging comments on the various control mechanisms that will be both intra-Community and external to it. I hope that I have given him a flavour of how I see the development of legislation in this area, but I counsel him not to be too attracted by the bureaucracy of the measures and to consider the international co-operation on intelligence. It is one thing to identify illicit activity in intra-Community and extra-Community trade, but it is another to know that it is going on. That is why one has to take into account activities of bodies such as Europol, our national criminal intelligence service and the range of measures incorporated in the 1990 Act. If the hon. Gentleman studies those details, he will see that there are mechanisms for mutual legal assistance and to deal with drug trafficking and money laundering on an international co-operative basis. He will be reassured that there is a platform there for dealing legally and on an informed basis with this despicable trade, as he described it. That also covers a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Shoreham (Mr. Stephen).<br><br>
I commend the order to the Committee.</span></p>
