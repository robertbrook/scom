<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was one of those who was fortunate, or unfortunate, enough, depending on one's viewpoint, to sit on the Committee considering the great Education Reform Bill—GERBIL—in 1987. In Committee at that time, the Government made clear their intention that grant-maintained schools would be funded in a similar way to local education authority schools, taking into account the money that grant-maintained schools had received for services that were usually delivered by the LEA to its own schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Report, Baroness Hooper, then an Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Education and Science, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government's intention is that the financial effects of opting out should be broadly neutral—for the school, for the national taxpayer and for the local ratepayer … we intend the financial position to be broadly neutral."—	<i>[Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 27 June 1988; Vol. 498, c. 1188.]</p></blockquote>
On Third Reading, Lord Trefgarne, then Minister for Defence Procurement, answered for the Government, I do not know whether that was a sign that they were feeling embattled. However, referring to grant-maintained schools, Lord Trefgarne said that they:
	<br><blockquote><p>"will not be funded any more generously than they would have been had they remained with their local education authority."—[	<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 17 July 1988; Vol. 499, c487–8.]</p></blockquote>
In paragraph 53 of its circular 10/88, the then Department of Education and Science said that a grant-maintained school's funding should
	<br><blockquote><p>"fairly represent what the LEA would have been likely to provide for the school had it continued to maintain it including expenditure on services provided centrally".</p></blockquote>
Unfortunately, we have moved a long way from that position, even though the Government have not
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
made a formal statement to the House about their decision to ensure that grant-maintained schools will be favoured by a strong element of injustice, unfairness and bias in their funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, the Government have convinced themselves with their own propaganda. In announcing the funding changes under discussion today in the Department for Education press release of 9 February, Baroness Blatch said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The funding arrangements will continue to be fair."</p></blockquote>
The truth is that they never were. The only consolation that I can offer schools that are not grant maintained is that the funding bias is being reduced with each wave of schools that become grant maintained. Such schools are receiving less and less in each wave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the practical problems that the regulations will present to local education authorities and their schools. The first is the DFE's insistence, despite strong representations from all local education authority associations, that the data from two financial years shoud be used to calculate the annual maintenance grant. Another problem is that the cash protection element built into the central annual maintenance grant will remain unchanged for the schools that opted out earlier, despite significant changes in the funding arrangements for LEA schools, involving more delegation and greater responsibility for buying services. I should like us to consider that in more detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State for Education has often made statements in the House on educational issues that apply to England and to Wales. The regulations that we are discussing today do not apply to Wales. It can be said that the handful of grant-maintained schools in Wales is being dealt with in a way that is fairer to all other local authority schools, compared with what is happening in England. If the system in England is fair, as Baroness Blatch suggested, the few grant-maintained schools in Wales are obviously being treated unfairly. However, if the system is a little fairer in Wales—as I believe—it is evident that the position in England is blatantly unfair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way in which cash protection works in the operation of the central annual maintenance grant means that in some local authorities whose schools opted out early there are five different levels of grant support to grant-maintained schools. The DFE is familiar with that. Its consultation paper of November 1992 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"So, a lower than average percentage figure for central costs AMG will tend to be in addition to a higher than average"—</p></blockquote>
the DFE underlined "higher than average"—
	<br><blockquote><p>"level of LMS-related funds (ie 'direct costs AMG'). The direct costs and central costs elements of AMG therefore need to be understood together and not in isolation."</p></blockquote>
How they operate means that the earlier a school became grant maintained, the greater advantage it has in its take of the available grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0375">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
The Local education authorities have already made representations to the Minister. In fact, when the Association of County Councils was a Conservative-controlled body—it is not now—it produced a report that was sent to its education committee for consideration. In that report, and in letters written to the Department for Education, the association has referred to the two problems that I have mentioned and has described the DFE's proposed solution as being "profoundly unsatisfactory". It felt deeply that the way in which the Government decided to calculate grants for grant-maintained schools was unfair. Local authorities wanted the data base to be for one year only. They have even said that they would be prepared to calculate it for the DFE based upon the DFE's own formula. However, that offer was rejected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The unfairness has been highlighted even for grant-maintained schools. In this year's settlement, the Government took account of the fact that cleaning and ground maintenance would be delegated. Therefore, schools opting out now do not have that taken into account when their central funding is calculated. However, schools that opted out in previous years are given money in their annual maintenance grant funding to take account of that fact. They do not lose any money because of it. In fact, they are paid twice for cleaning and ground maintenance. In some local authorities the position is even worse than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall illustrate the problem by a hypothetical case and then give some practical examples of what is happening in local education authorities. Take a school that receives a delegated budget of £800,000 and £200,000 in addition, which is the cash value of services provided by the local authority. That totals £1 million, and 25 per cent. of £800,000 constitutes the direct annual maintenance grant. Let us assume that that was the position in 1992–93. In 1993–94, the local education authority may have delegated more money so that a school would receive £900,000. The cash value of centrally-provided services may be £100,000, which is just over 11 per cent. of the delegated budget. However, a grant-maintained school that already existed would receive the £900,000, but not the £100,000. It would receive 25 per cent. of £900,000, which comes to £225,000. Therefore it has an advantage over the local authority school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is happening in practice in local education authorities? The one that can be best highlighted is the London borough of Hillingdon because it was at the forefront of the campaign to encourage schools to opt out. However, a feeling of regret is growing in the borough about that policy. Hillingdon has to pay more to its grant-maintained schools than to its own schools on two counts. The first relates to the percentage of money that the local authority keeps back to provide its central services. For Hillingdon, the Department for Education calculated an add-on of 16.5 per cent. in primary schools and 11.5 per cent. in secondary schools for those central services.
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Hillingdon itself calculated the figures—very precisely—at 14.99 per cent. and 11.09 per cent. As a result of the Departments calculations, opted-out schools in Hillingdon receive 1.51 per cent. more of the central services money and primary schools receive 0.41 per cent. more. That amounts to £110,283.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real problem occurs in relation to the cash protection given to grant-maintained schools which opted out earlier. Nine opted out before 1992–93. Because of that cash protection, Hillingdon has worked out that the grant-maintained schools receive £505,613 more—a grand total of £615,896 more than they would receive if the money were being distributed fairly. That is the perpetuation of historic funding. Schools that opt out today will not receive the same cash advantages as those that opted out at the beginning of the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some authorities have made specific calculations for schools that opted out earlier. Wandsworth, a Conservative-controlled authority, has calculated that it has spent £1 million more than necessary because of the way in which the funding is worked out. Two schools, in particular, that opted out at an early stage are receiving £308,000 more than they should. A grant-maintained school in a Conservative-controlled west midlands authority is receiving £50,000 more than it should. In Calderdale there are five grant-maintained schools which the authority reckons receive £154,000 more than they should for the local education central services provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another problem. Section 11 money is provided for authorities to give special help to children whose first language is not English. Yet a grant-maintained school in Tower Hamlets, which has no children whose first language is not English, still receives some section 11 money. There is almost an incentive for schools in Tower Hamlets which do not have New Commonwealth children to opt out because they receive a share of the section 11 money which they do not use because they have no children whose first language is not English. There are many examples of such problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister anticipate such over-funding becoming a permanent part of the system, especially when, from 1994, the Government are committed to introducing the common funding formula, presumably in those areas where a significant number of schools have opted out?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister believe that I am wrong about the grant-maintained schools that opted out earlier? A specific cash protection exists for them. It can be eroded only by inflation—a problem that all schools suffer. Before the council elections on 6 April, the Association of County Councils made representations to the Secretary of State in a letter asking straightforward questions. Yet the Secretary of State took a month to answer it. The association did not receive a reply until the day of the elections, or perhaps the day after. The bad news in the letter did
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0376">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
not avert the disaster that the Government suffered in the council elections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the letter was written, Dr. Barbara Marshall chaired the education committee of the Association of County Councils. In his reply to her, the Secretary of State makes a misleading statement about cash protection. I cannot use in Committee the word that one expert used to describe the statement, but the expert agreed that "gobbledegook" was an acceptable description for public dissimination. The Secretary of State said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The cash protection arrangements are an important safeguard for self-governing state schools. They help them adapt gradually to falling central cost percentages. Over time the protection erodes for each school."</p></blockquote>
I do not understand how that can happen. There is a fall in the central cost percentage and the amount of money that a grant-maintained school receives. However, if a school became grant maintained last year and was given a central annual maintenance grant of 15 per cent., it will continue to receive that grant. A school that opts out this year, the central costs of which have been calculated to be 10 per cent., will receive only that 10 per cent. cash value of the central services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 1(2) of the regulation states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of regulation 8(1), the relevant percentage in respect of any school for any financial year is whichever is the greater of the percentages determined for the school in accordance with paragraphs 4 and 5."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, I assume that a school that opted out earlier and received a grant of 15 per cent. will receive a grant at that percentage for at least this year, even if the central costs are now calculated to be 10 per cent. Schools that opted out last year will receive extra money. If that is not the case, I should like some clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local education authorities have said that because of the cash protection, schools that opted out early with a greater sum continue to receive the percentage that they had at opt-out. That was because the LEA still held many central services. They have since devolved them to other schools and kept back less money. It makes sense, therefore, for a lesser share to go to grant-maintained schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Mr. Eric Forth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Quite simply, it is not the percentage that is protected or frozen but the cash amount, hence the term "cash protection". The hon. Gentleman seemed anxious that somehow the percentage was protected. It is not. The deal is that the cash amount is protected. When I come to say my very few words later, I shall touch on that matter if he wishes. But, lest he misleads himself or others, I repeat that protected cash percentage there is not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. The important point is that grant-maintained schools that opted out a year or two ago receive an annual maintenance grant to cover
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
central costs based upon services that the LEA provided at the time, before they handed them over to all schools. They receive the equivalent sum for services that were provided by the LEA, plus the amount received by schools as part of their direct amount. They are being paid twice. I realise that they do not continue to receive the percentage, but they continue with the percentage that they received at the time of opt out. Therefore a double payment is made to them for the same local authority services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The illustration of Hillingdon shows that an appreciable sum—almost £700,000—is being paid by that authority as part of the double service cash which only the early opt-out schools receive. Hence the differing levels of payment to schools that opted out at different times. Surely that is indefensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen to the regulations when the common funding formula becomes operative next year? According to the Department for Education, it seems that some grant-maintained schools will operate under a common funding formula, as yet unknown, but which, judging by the consultation paper, will probably be based on the standard spending assessment for education in LEAs in which the funding formula will apply. Alternatively, the schools will receive money through the regulations—or through a further amendment to the regulations that may be laid later in the year. It would perhaps be as well for schools that are considering opting out to stop doing so for the time being and to reflect upon the common funding formula. There is great disquiet already about the way in which the SSA works.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only today in 	<i>The Guardian,</i> the Audit Commission is reported as having described the proposed system as "confusing and complicated". The commission stated that the system
	<br><blockquote><p>"no longer performs the task for which it was set up four years ago".</p></blockquote>
It agrees that the SSA
	<br><blockquote><p>"works better than any of its predecessors"</p></blockquote>
but suggests that
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is neither simple to understand nor stable in its outcome."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to say that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the key objective of the system—to assess how much local authority needs to spend to provide a standard level of service"</p></blockquote>
is not being met at all. The report states: 	<br><blockquote><p>"No standard level of service is defined or achieved."</p></blockquote>
It lists 12 criteria on which those matters might be assessed. It calculated that in only two of the 12 instances—17 per cent. in round numbers—did the criteria set in relation to defined services come anywhere near being met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cambridgeshire, South-West (Sir A. Grant) has raised the issue. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The whole principle of area cost adjustment"</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0377">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
which is part of the standard spending assessment—
	<br><blockquote><p>"is completely outdated."</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (Mrs. Campbell) pointed out that
	<br><blockquote><p>"there is consensus that SSAs are inequitable and … they are being abused."</p></blockquote>
Figures were provided in 	<i>The Times Educational Supplement</i> last week. It was pointed out, for example, with regard to Gloucestershire, that Oxfordshire, the adjacent county, received £18 million in area cost adjustment, which Gloucestershire did not. Hampshire, not too far away and, on the face of it a much richer area, received £51 million. There are tremendous problems with the SSAs. Many local authorities spend more than the amount for which the Government has assessed them for the education part of their SSA. What will happen to those grant-maintained schools when the measure comes into being?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to point out one or two other injustices in the system. Regulation 17, for example, permits the Secretary of State to pay special purpose grants to grant-maintained schools, in what he describes as exceptional or emergency situations, to enable them to continue to operate. I am aware of no provision allowing the grant of extra money to a local education authority school to overcome an emergency. Will the Minister have something to say about that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other anomalies in the system. A grant-maintained school receives a percentage in its central annual maintenance grant to cover the cost of local authority central services. However, those local authority central services include doing all the calculations necessitated by the fact that there are opted-out schools in the local authority. The grant-maintained school receives money from the local authority for services that the local authority is having to provide to enable that grant-maintained school to exist. That is a serious anomaly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no statutory provision for nursery education but the Secretary of State can provide money for a grant-maintained school where there are children of nursery age. That money can be recovered from the local education authority. However, because of the dangers of capping, the local education authority may not provide any nursery places at all. In effect, the opted-out school is imposing a precept on the LEA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to move discussion away from the revenue aspect of the subject and to consider some of the special grants that are given to the opted-out schools. Let us consider the unfairness of the situation. A local education authority that applies for capital funding from the Government advances its bid and then receives the right to borrow money to carry out its capital programme. However, a grant-maintained school simply receives the money for its capital project as a grant which has no revenue implications. The local education authority has only
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
the right to borrow the money to do its work and it has to pay later. In some small LEAs, there are grant-maintained schools that have received as much money for their capital work as the local authority receives for all its schools. In 1993–94—this financial year—one third of the available capital has gone to 2 per cent. of schools in England—grant-maintained schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In defence of that policy, the Government have said that they are making up for previous underfunding by LEAs. I should like the Minister to give us chapter and verse on the way in which schools that have opted out have been underfunded for capital expenditure compared with LEA schools. I should like to see that evidence and we are right to demand an answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also wish to consider the special purpose grants that the Government are giving to grant-maintained schools. We should compare what happens to them with the position of LEAs. When an LEA applies for a special purpose grant, it must put forward a programme to the Government. That programme, or part of it—at least one project—must be accepted. If so, the LEA receives 60 per cent. of the funding for the projects that are accepted for special purpose grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, a grant-maintained school automatically receives its share of the money without having to put forward a programme for acceptance to the DFE and without having to add on the extra money that the local authority has to provide. Therefore, it is evident that the way in which the system has worked so far has been unfair to 98 per cent. of schools and pupils in this country. In their effort to bribe schools to opt out, the Government have given them more financial inducements, but overwhelmingly they have not worked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to make it clear to LEA and grant-maintained schools—the LEAs are well aware of the fact—that a cash crisis is looming for schools and LEAs. The case of Hillingdon demonstrates that. Hillingdon has to find £700,000 out of its budget for overpayments. Under the standing spending assessment, many local authorities pay more. What will happen when the common funding formula comes into operation? As each new wave of grant-maintained schools has come into being, it has received less than the previous wave. However, perhaps "wave" is rather a grandiose word to use considering how few schools have opted out. The common funding formula will put a real squeeze on schools that opted out earlier. The longer the schools have had grant-maintained status, the bigger the squeeze will be. If I may paraphrase the words of the late Anthony Crosland, the party is over for grant-maintained schools—thank goodness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

With your agreement, Mr. Sims, I should like to make my comments in the form of a few brief questions which I hope that the Minister will answer when he responds to the debate.

	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
I preface my questions by saying that, although the Liberal Democrats are opposed to the principle of grant-maintained schools, this is not the time to rehearse that argument. We are here to discuss the regulations. It is fair to say that any detailed analysis of the regulations clearly demonstrates that they do not contain the principle of fairness that the Government claim applies to the funding of grant-maintained schools. Indeed, the regulations will perpetuate the unfair way in which grant-maintained schools are funded. That is a great pity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 30 March I asked the Under-Secretary of State for Further and Higher Education whether grant-maintained schools, as opposed to local education authority schools, received more, the same or fewer resources for their current expenditure. I should be interested to hear the Ministers response to that question, so that we may compare his answer with that given by his hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly will the Minister confirm that under the regulations, if a local authority in the current financial year has reduced its expenditure on education—possibly to avoid the threat of rate capping—the LEA schools will bear the brunt of that reduction? Will he also confirm that under the regulations, which are based on previous years' figures, grant-maintained schools will not have to bear the brunt of such a reduction? If so, does the Minister think that that is fair?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, does the Minister agree that the cash protection arrangements provide a disincentive to local education authorities to move towards increased delegation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, does the Minister believe that grant-maintained schools should have a reduction in their budgets to reflect the Government expenditure that is specifically directed at such schools?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, how many responses were received to the consultation on the regulations? In the Minister's view, have the fears and concerns expressed in those responses been overcome by the content of the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Heeley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) has outlined our fears well. I should like some guidance from the Minister about the formula in regulation 10(3) on page 6.1 have never fully understood it, to be honest. I gives me a headache just thinking about it, so, in vengeance, I shall ask a question about it. What is the relationship between F, the amount of money spent on free school meals in a relevant school, and P, which covers the average number of pupils who receive such meals in relevant schools? That relationship will affect the final calculation. The document does not explain that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
	<p>5.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the fifth year in which a Committee has considered such regulations. Therefore, any attempt to introduce drama into our proceedings will not succeed. We are considering regulations that are essentially unchanged. Any changes have been made mostly in response to the results of consultation. To answer the question of the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster), we received more than 100 responses to the consultation document. The more important changes were made to meet the reasonable requests of local education authorities. One such change is the move from a uniform percentage figure to a figure that relates circumstances more directly to each authority. If the Opposition pressed the regulations to a Division and succeeded in defeating them—that is unlikely, but my hon. Friends must make up their own minds about the regulations—we would be in an ironical position. No regulations would be in force this year, or last year's regulations would continue to apply. In that event, the goodies that we offer LEAs would disappear. I am sure that the Opposition do not want that to happen. I hope that Opposition Members will consider that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Sims. Is it possible for the Committee to vote against the regulations, as the Minister suggests?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no provision to vote against the regulations. The Question will be put at the end of our proceedings. Hon. Members are entitled to vote on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I leave the hon. Member for Bath to ponder that. I thank you, Mr. Sims, for your guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition asked whether grant-maintained schools receive more resources. We have always made it clear that grant-maintained schools will receive additional resources to cover their extra responsibilities and to reflect their position as self-governing, autonomous schools. We have never made a secret of that. There is nothing for which to apologise. Occasionally, there may be legitimate arguments about the exact figuring behind the principle, but the principle stands. It is straightforward and well understood.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But is it not true that schools that opted out in the first or second waves are currently paid twice for some services, which local authorities provided in the past? Those schools receive moneys in an annual maintenance grant through the delegation of budgets. They also retain the cash that they received when local authorities provided those services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, if the hon. Gentleman wishes to consider the matter in that way. Cash protection exists to shield schools from excessive variations in funding from year-to-year. That is a sound principle. In keeping faith with grant-maintained schools, we also keep faith with the principle of opting out, which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0379">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
we offer schools after parental balloting. As a result of a change of political control in a LEA, it is possible that LEA schools will suffer variations in funding. In an uncertain political environment it is also possible that schools may find grant-maintained, autonomous status, which is free from the vagaries of political variation, more attractive. Recent political events could provide the biggest boost to the grant-maintained sector. All that is possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Bridgend raised the first follow-up point that I wanted to make. I must press the Minister. I fully understand his answer that grant-maintained schools receive additional resources for their extra responsibilities, such as VAT payments and insurance. However, to be absolutely clear, will the Minister confirm that grant-maintained schools do not receive additional resources for items such as books and equipment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The great joy of grant-maintained schools is that they are free to spend their resources as they choose. Most have managed to spend more on books and equipment since they became grant maintained. The record speaks for itself. It has been demonstrated over and over again that grant-maintained schools have managed to spend their resources more effectively in educational terms than have local education authority schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of that answer, will the Minister confirm that there are no additional resources in the formula calculations in the regulations for books and equipment and that the resources are merely to cover the additional responsibilities that he has described?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman gives an interesting insight into his psychology and his political philosophy. We have no intention of specifying on what grant-maintained schools must spend their resources. I understand why the hon. Member takes exception to the idea of grant-maintained schools: he is a new Liberal, believing in central control and imposition and not in the traditional liberalism of thought and action for which I always thought that the Liberal party stood. However, that is the hon. Gentleman's problem, not mine. I have no intention of specifying what schools spend on books and equipment. That is for them to decide, and the record shows that they decide excellently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not it true that because the schools that became grant maintained early on are paid twice for certain services they can probably afford to buy more books and equipment, and that schools that become grant maintained now receive less than those that became grant maintained earlier?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is true—it may well be for all I know—it is odd that more and more schools are becoming grant maintained as time goes on. The ones that spotted the opportunities early may be being rewarded for that, and good luck to them. The fact is that more and more schools still regard grant-
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
maintained status as attractive and so continue to opt for it. The number is now well over 800, and it is rising steadily and comfortingly. There is no problem with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bridgend referred to capital. He asked whether I could give examples of schools that felt that their local education authorities had been hard on them, which would justify the compensatory capital payment arrangements. On 16 December 1992, I wrote to the hon. Member for Warrington, South (Mr. Hall), who asked me the same question in the Committee on which we both served for so many weeks and months. In that letter I gave the hon. Gentleman many such examples. I would not dream of wearying the Committee with them now; I shall give the hon. Member for Bridgend a copy of them later. However, to give the hon. Gentleman a flavour, let me read out one or two. I shall not name the schools, which would be wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One school said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"'whilst under the LEA, it was grossly under-provided with Science and Technology resources'."</p></blockquote>
Another school said that it had bid for six science laboratories and the governors said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"'an outline plan was approved by [the] LEA in 1987'",</p></blockquote>
but it was
	<br><blockquote><p>"'frozen when the LEA began its review of secondary education, and subsequently dropped when GM status was approved'."</p></blockquote>
I could go through the lengthy list, which runs to pages and pages. I shall give the hon. Member for Bridgend a copy; he could have asked his hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, South for one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for beginning to tell us something about the problem. However, as he is so familiar with it, can he tell us what percentage of schools that have grant-maintained status are contained in that list?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the number of grant-maintained schools is rising so quickly, the percentage will probably fall. I believe that that would be so, arithmetically. It is probably a fairly meaningless figure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Take the date on which the letter was written.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall let the hon. Gentleman know later. He knows that I cannot possibly give him a figure now. But as the number of grant-maintained schools is rising so spectacularly and we are looking at a moving target, I suspect that any such figure will be fairly meaningless. The letter is dated 16 December 1992.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How many grant-maintained schools were there then?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman wanted percentages, we should have to take a snapshot of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0380">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
number of grant-maintained schools in operation in December 1992, which would probably be about 200 or 300. I have about 20 or 30 examples here. Therefore, about 10 or 15 per cent. of schools considered that they had been grossly badly treated by their LEAs and that the capital allocations to the grant-maintained sector were fully justified, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bath wondered whether, if an LEA reduced its expenditure in education, its schools would somehow bear the brunt of cuts while grant-maintained schools would escape. The answer, I think, is that the main part of the funding—the annual maintenance grant to grant-maintained schools—reflects changes in the LEA budget, if the information is supplied on time, including for this year. Therefore, the bulk of the funding to grant-maintained schools would reflect such a reduction. Of course, cash protection would then come to the rescue of grant-maintained schools because we have designed it thus. That points up the vulnerability of LEA schools to the changing policies of local education authorities. However, grant-maintained status gives schools a safe haven. They are protected by the steady hand of the Department for Education, soon to be the steady hand of the Funding Agency for Schools. They are not as vulnerable to the extreme variations of local education authorities. I readily acknowledge that difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have answered most of the questions asked by Opposition Members—at least, those that require an answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Except for my question on the formula.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confess—except for the hon. Gentleman's question. Perhaps I may give him a proper answer, in writing, after the Committee. I do not want to attempt to give an answer—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tottenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To all hon. Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Gentleman. I shall write to all members of the Committee, unless my hon. Friends exonerate me from that responsibility. But I shall certainly write to Opposition Members, replying to the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Trevor Skeet 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bedfordshire, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw my hon. Friend's attention to regulation 17, paragraphs (5) and (6), relating to emergency grants. The Secretary of State has said that the provision will be used only in emergencies. As the regulations are much the same as those for last year and the year before that, I wonder how often the provision is used and for what purposes is it envisaged?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has asked a very good question which, I believe, the Opposition also asked.
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
In exceptional cases—when a grant-maintained school is in difficulties due to unforeseen circumstances, force majeure, or whatever—it does not seem unreasonable to have a saving provision so that exceptional payments can be made to enable such schools to continue educating their children. We do not want to contemplate the possibility of a grant-maintained school, through no fault of its own, failing to educate its children. That is a reasonable provision to include in the regulations. Only in such exceptional circumstances would such payments be made. I am subject to correction, but I think that probably no such payments have yet been made. If there have been any, it is literally one or two, and no more. I think that I can assure my hon. Friend that it is an exceptional provision designed for exceptional circumstances. However, it is right that it exists. The regulations very much follow the pattern of previous years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may follow up one point. At the outset, the Minister properly said that a number of the changes in the regulations were to take account of representations by LEAs and their associations. They are grateful for some of those changes. The two fundamental issues are cash protection and the manner in which the balance between the direct and central annual maintenance grants works. Because of the two-year phasing of funding whereby, a grant-maintained school can receive 80 per cent. of its budget in one financial year because of the LEA's allocation a school can receive a further 25 per cent. of the budget and, effectively, receive 105 per cent. of the applicable amount because the previous year's figures are used to calculate the central grant. LEAs offered to do this work for the Department for Education to enable it all to be taken in one financial year's package. I am surprised that the DFE did not take up the offer because that would have been much more equitable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Local authorities make many offers to the Department, in turn attractive, credible, mischievous and impractical. We have tried to put together an approach that strikes a balance between practicality and achievability and I think that we have it. For example, we allowed last year's figures to be used as the basis of the figuring and we invited LEAs to submit data by 31 March. All but eight did so and that enabled us to get the most up-to-date basis for figuring. If the hon. Gentleman chooses to work in a tortuous way backwards from cash protection to the figures that he produced, that is a matter for him. I am content that cash protection is a matter of keeping faith with the grant-maintained school sector. That is how it should be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why is it not done that way in Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman wishes to speak about Wales, I can detain him for some time. Is he suggesting that we ensure that Wales and England are aligned in these matters?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0381">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is because he can see what is coming a mile away. If he wishes to ensure that public sector expenditure is brought into line between Wales and England—many hon. Members with English constituences would find that an attractive proposition—I should be interested in having such fruitful discussions with him. The hon. Gentleman proposes what he thinks would be an attractive Welsh example and seeks to apply it to England. I suspect that he would not wish to reverse it in many respects because his part of the United Kingdom receives extremely favourable treatment from United Kingdom taxpayers at large. I am sure that he is grateful, although the Welsh people do not always show enormous gratitude, but that is another matter. I shall not be diverted to some sideshow by spurious comparisons between England and Wales. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales does very well for the Welsh people in this and so many other ways. I have some envy for the people of Wales as a result, but it is not germane to the debate to get bogged down in futile comparisons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seem to have touched a rather sore point. It is not a question of the amount available for each sector. We could argue forever about the way in which Government Departments spend their money throughout the United Kingdom. We could not do so here, but I would be willing to take it up elsewhere. I wish to know why we in Wales are capable of administering in a way that allows one year's figures to be used to fund grant-maintained schools, while the Department for Education is unable to do that for England even though LEAs offered help? What administrative problem does England have that Wales has overcome?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is just possible that it arises because England is somewhat bigger than Wales. It might be that simple. I do not think that such comparisons are very fruitful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have shown the Committee that the regulations are an almost seamless continuum of policy of support for the grant-maintained sector, as has been set out previously and as reflected in statute. Important changes have been made this year, mainly arising from local education authorities' responses to consultation. All in all, the regulations strike a fair balance between the LEAs reasonable demands on the one hand and the grant-maintained sector's requirements on the other.
