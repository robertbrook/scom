Foreign Satellite Service Proscription Order<br><br> 1993</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committe has considered the Foreign Satellite Service Proscription Order 1993. (S.I., 1993, No. 1024)—<i>[Mr. Sproat.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tom Pendry <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stalybridge and Hyde)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I apologise for the absence of my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Corbett). He has an important engagement in his constituency and has asked me to convey his apologies to the Committee. In his letter, he perhaps stated the obvious when he said that I would be a poor substitute for him. However, in some people's eyes the Minister with responsibility for sport and the shadow Minister with responsibility for sport are the right people to debate this subject.<br><br>
It is the Opposition's view that the Order should not be seen as a censorship measure. The issues go wider that that. I have not seen much Red Hot Dutch television although, thanks to the Broadcasting Standards Council, I saw a video of some of its programmes yesterday. I am not in a position to say whether it falls consistently into the category of soft or hard porn, but from what I saw yesterday, it clearly seems to contravene article 22 of the European broadcasting directive and the Broadcasting Act 1990.<br><br>
We all have our views of the Broadcasting Act 1990 and I do not suppose that many Conservative Members believe that it should be supported in full. Nevertheless, we must use that Act, as well as the directive, in our support for the order.<br><br>
As I hinted, we also support the measure on grounds different from the Mary Whitehouses and others. It is our right as a nation to decide what type terrestrial or satellite television should be shown to our constituents. The order relates more to national control than to censorship. Some people argue that most European countries receive these programmes—meny do—so why should not we. However, that is a matter for them. Under article 2 of the directive on television broadcasting activities, transmission of programmes from another member state may be restricted in certain circumstances. I agree with that provision but, more importantly, so did the judges in the divisional court and the Courts of Appeal—Lord Justice Glidewell, Mr. Justice Hirst, Lord Justice Kennedy and, recently, Lord Justice Leggatt and Mr. Justice McCullough. <i>[Interruption.]</i> There is a lot of talking among conservative Members. I hope that they will intervene if I am slightly off course. However, I might be ever more worried if they thought that I was on course.<br><br>
We believe that the Secretary of State was right to impose a ban on the reception of Red Hot Television in the United Kingdom. As we know, he has the support of the Broadcating Standards Council—which yesterday
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
explained to me why it took that view—and of the Independent Television Commission. The Secretary of State rightly argued in the High Court that the European directive on transfrontier broadcasting applied equally to satellite channels when it dealt with retransmission. We agree that it would be illogical and inconsistent if any other interpretation were put on the directive.<br><br>
The channel appears to contravene article 22. It can be argued that, as its transmisions take place after midnight in the wee small hours of the morning, it does not infringe article 22 in that way. But we believe that the Secretary of State has a right in law to ban the channel. However, the European Court, as it trundles its way through the relevant machinery may take a different view.<br><br>
The Government are right in this case. Therefore, it must be equally right to review the law in this area, where there is so much confusion and inconsistency. What is more, the issue should be the subject of a wider and longer debate on another occasion.<br><br>
With those few words, I concur with the proscription order. The Secretary of State was right to take the advice of the ITC and the Broadcasting Standards Council. On that basis, we support the order.<br><br>
10.37am</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for National Heritage (Mr Iain Sproat)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde (Mr Pendry) for his support, and for going through a rather gruesome ordeal yesterday to enable him to take the place of his hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr Corbett).<br><br>
I am grateful to the Committee for giving me the opportunity to explain the Government's reasons for taking action against the foreign satellite channel Red Hot Television. I agree with the hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde that a much wider debate is called into question by the order, which we shall not deal with in great depth or at great length this morning. I should like to explain why the order was made by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, and to give the Committee a little of the chronology to show how and why we reached our present position.<br><br>
The showing of explicity pornographic material on television has aroused serious concerns among right hon. and hon. Members and members of the public. My Department has received about 700 letters on the subject, almost all of which express very strong views against the sort of material the Red Hot Television has been broadcasting.<br><br>
I should like to make it absolutely clear that the Government will not allow pornography such as that broadcast by Red Hot Television. We will make use of every course of action available to us to prevent the grave offence caused to the public by such material. I hope that the action that we have taken against Red Hot Television will send the strongest possible message to all purveyors of this obnoxious material that the United Kingdom is a no-go area for such pornography.<br><br>
Before explaining the action that we have taken, it may be helpful to the Committee if I set out the background to the channel and give information about the recent court proceedings, to which the hon. Gentleman referred. Red Hot Television, or Red Hot Dutch as it was then known, began broadcasting to the United Kingdom at the end of July 1992. The service was marketed to customers in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0832">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
United Kingdom who had existing satellite dishes for a subscription of about £50 a quarter. It broadcast in encrypted form on three nights a week, which was then increased to six nights a week between the hours of midnight and 4 a.m.<br><br>
There has been ill-informed speculation about the content of the channel. To set the record straight, I shall quote from an affirmation made by Mr. Colin Shaw, director of the Broadcasting Standards Council, which formed part of the evidence of the Secretary of State at the recent court proceedings. In describing the content of Red Hot Television, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"From the outset, the channel broadcast films, mainly of American origin, showing explicit sex between males and females, including oral sex, close-up shots of penetration and ejaculation. Explicit lesbian scenes have also been shown. Group heterosexual and lesbian orgies are commonplace. Subsequently, the output, which then generally consisted of two films each of about 90 minutes duration, separated by a music item, included buggery of females by males, and the insertion of vibrators, dildoes and other sexual aids into the anal passages of both males and females. In a number of films, women were shown being penetrated in the vagina and anus, at the time, by two different males. There is little or no story in the films, which almost invariably contain a series of couplings and other sexual practices, usually accompanied by the minimum of dialogue, which is often littered with strong sexual language, used in its literal sense."</p></blockquote>
The essence of the situation was that a television service was being provided which, for four hours a night, six nights a week, was broadcasting a relentless diet of hard core pornography. I use the term "hard core" advisedly: the material in question would breach any programme code established for United Kingdom broadcasters. There can be no doubt about that. It would be illegal if published in any other media in the United Kingdom because of the terms of the Obscene Publications Act 1959. It contains the portrayal of acts which are themselves offences under the Sexual Offences Act 1956.<br><br>
When the service began broadcasting in July last year, it was using an uplink—beaming a signal to the Eutelsat satellite—from a base in the Netherlands. In terms of the Broadcasting Act 1990, the fact of a foreign uplink places the service beyond the powers of the Independent Television Commission and defines it as a "foreign satellite service". The Broadcast Act 1990 recognised clearly that the increase in the number of satellite services created the possibility that services would become available in the United Kingdom which we would consider unacceptable.<br><br>
For that reason, special provisions were included in sections 177 and 178 of the Broadcasting Act 1990 which were designed to deal with such a situation. The sections establish a framework within which an unacceptable satellite service can be proscribed under section 177 for the purposes of section 178 of the Act. Invoking these provisions, in respect of a particular foreign satellite service, enables certain steps to be taken to limit the availability of the service in the United Kingdom.<br><br>
The steps include prohibition of the sale of decoders for the service, a ban on advertising—that is, either advertising for the service, or advertising on the service—and a prohibition on the supply of programme material for the service. It does not become an offence to watch the service, partly because such provisions would be either unenforeceable or extremely difficult to enforce, but also because we do not wish to criminalise individual viewers. It is the purveyors of pornography whom we wish to stop.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
Before an encrypted service can be proscribed, three conditions, which are set out in section 177 of the Broadcasting Act 1990, must be met. First, the Independent Television Commission must inform the Secretary of State that it considers the service to be unacceptable. Secondly, the Secretary of State must be satisfied that it is in the public interest to proscribe the service. Thirdly, any proscription must be compatible with the international obligations of the United Kingdom. In this last regard, as hon. Members are no doubt aware, our main international obligation in the case of our relations with EC countries arises under the European Council directive, "Television Without Frontiers", which is often called the broadcasting directive.<br><br>
The broadcasting directive is a single-market measure that sets minimum standards for broadcasting in several spheres, such as advertising. Provided those standards are met, member states are required to ensure freedom of reception of broadcasting from other member states. Only if a broadcast breaches the standards set out for the protection of minors may the receiving member state take action.<br><br>
Under the directive, member states must ensure that broadcasters under their jurisdiction comply with the law. For those purposes the relevant article, to which the hon. Gentleman referred, is article 22. It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I quote that article, which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Member States shall take appropriate measures to ensure that television broadcasts by broadcasters under their jurisdiction, do not include programmes which might seriously impair the physical, mental or moral development of minors, in particular those that involve pornography or gratuitous violence. This provision shall extend to other programmes, which are likely to impair the physical mental or moral development of minors, except"—</p></blockquote>
and this is a key point with which I shall deal in a moment—
<br><blockquote><p>"where it is ensured, by selecting the time of the broadcast or by any technical measure, that minors in the area of transmission will not normally hear or see such broadcasts".</p></blockquote>
A grave breach of article 22 is the only circumstance in which a member state has the right to suspend retransmissions of a service—and then only when the directive has been breached at least twice and consultations have failed to produce an amicable settlement. That is the complex background to the proscription of Red Hot Television.<br><br>
I now give the Committee a chronology of events leading to the proscription order before us today.<br><br>
On 15 October 1992, the Independent Television Commission wrote to my Department to inform the Secretary of State that in its view, Red Hot Television should be the subject of a proscription order. Officials in the Department were, of course, in touch with officials in the Netherlands, who were beginning court proceedings against Red Hot Television. As the Committee will remember, the programmes were originating from the Netherlands. The reason for the Dutch court proceedings was, as we understand it, that Red Hot Television did not possess a valid licence to broadcast. As it was then under Dutch jurisdiction, it was for the Dutch authorities to take action. Indeed, the action that they took resulted in the breaking, on 1 December 1992, of the contract that had allowed Red Hot Television to broadcast from the Netherlands.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0833">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
The Broadcasting Standards Council, which monitors the service in the United Kingdom, then reported that over the weekend of 5 and 6 December 1992, the broadcasts appeared to be coming from Denmark. When approached by British officials, the Danish authorities reported that they hoped to be able to regulate the service in the new year. However, by January 1993, it became clear that Danish action would not be possible for quite some time and that, consequently, action would have to be taken in the United Kingdom if Red Hot Television was to be hindered from reaching a British audience.<br><br>
My officials discussd with the European Commission on several occasions the scope for taking action against Red Hot Television under the broadcasting directive and under the provisions of the Broadcasting Act 1990 that I mentioned earlier. The case was the first of its kind to be brought under the directive. As is inevitable with new legislation, questions of interpretation were bound to arise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Cohen <span class='memberconstituency'>(Leyton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that if the channel had been regulated in another European country or had possessed a valid licence, we should not have taken action against it by introducing the order?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sproat</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. that is not the case. I apologise if I did not make that clear, but I was running through the chronology to explain how we reached our position. The attitudes of the British, the Dutch and the Danes differ to a greater or lesser degree. The contract in The Netherlands was between the company and the Eutelsat satellite. It was broken on 1 December 1992 because the information that Red Hot Television had given to the Dutch authorities was inaccurate. The inaccuracy of that information invalidated the licence which, in turn, caused the contract with Eutelsat to be broken.<br><br>
Red Hot Television then went to Denmark where, as we know, the attitude to pornography is different. The Danes were more free and easy. They did not have commercial television and so had to introduce laws to deal with the entire issue. As they have a system of proportional representation, dozens of parties had to be consulted. It was taking them so long that it became clear to us that we had to take action ourselves. Even if none of that had occurred, we should have concluded that the satellite service was unacceptable. I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving me the chance to explain that.<br><br>
We then went to the Commission. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State had a telephone conversation with Commissioner Pinheiro, the European Commissioner responsible for audiovisual matters. I am glad to be able to tell the Committee that there was a complete meeting of minds. The Commission showed itself as determined as the British Government to ensure that the broadcasting directive was not abused to create a single market in pornography. After much consideration, the Commission, most helpfully, informed us that the action we proposed to take against Red Hot Television was, in its view, fully compatible with the directive.<br><br>
As a result, on 19 March, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State informed Red Hot Television, the Dutch and Danish authorities and the Commission of our belief that directive was being breached and of our intention provisionally to suspend retransmission of Red Hot Television if we could not reach an amicable settlement within 15 days and if the breaches of the directive
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
continued. Those conditions were, indeed, satisfied and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State duly made an order under section 177 of the Act on 6 April this year.<br><br>
As we had, by then, been informed that Red Hot Television intended to apply for judicial review and that the date of the hearing was fixed for 23 April, the order was timed to come into force on 1 May, once the divisional court had had the opportunity to form a view. The judicial review was heard on 23 April. Red Hot Television sought to overturn the order on the grounds that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State did not have the power to make it.<br><br>
As I have said, two out of the three conditions neccessary for an order were indisputably in place: The ITC had informed us that it believed that a proscription order was appropriate and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State was satisfied that proscription would be in the public interest. As to the third condition, relating to our international obligations, it would be clear to almost anyone who has seen this service that the material has the potential seriously to damage the development of children. It is interesting to note that Red Hot Television did not contend otherwise. However, it did contend that because the service is broadcast late at night and in encrypted form, children will not have access to it and consequently cannot be damaged. We do not accept that argument. The directive recognises that there is material that has the potential to damage children so severely that it can never be acceptable, regardless of the time and of the technical nature of the broadcast. The material of Red Hot Television is, in our view, firmly in that category.<br><br>
The second issue on which judicial review was sought was that even if a breach of article 22 had occured, the United Kingdom had no power to suspend retransmission of Red Hot Television, because, in fact, no retransmission occured in the United Kingdom, whether via cable or terrestrial means. The British Government contended that it could not have been the intention of the directive that whereas action could be taken to suspend retransmission of a service from satellite to a cable network and then to the public, no action could be taken to hinder reception of an offending satellite service beamed direct to people's homes. We are talking about a dictionary definition of the word "retransmission". The Commission supported our contention. The divisional court found that the arguments were not clear and decided that the European Court should be asked for its views. In addition, since the matter was to be heard by the European Court of Justice in any event, the court also decided to seek clarification of the meaning of article 22.<br><br>
The following two questions are now before the European Court. First, does the directive allow the United Kingdom to take action to restrict reception in the United Kingdom of broadcasts transmitted from another member state when those broadcasts are received by the public directly via satellite? Secondly, do the obligations of a member state under article 22—to ensure that television broadcasts do not impair the physical, mental or moral development of minors—apply in relation to broadcasts where it is ensured or attempted to be ensured by selecting the time of the broadcast or by any technical measure that minors will not normally hear or see such broadcasts?<br><br>
We will, of course, put our case forcefully to the court in Luxembourg in due course along the lines that I have given to the Committee this morning. In the meantime, the order
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0834">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
remains in force. Red Hot Television failed in its attempt to obtain an injunction from the court to overturn the order. We believe that our action was right. When children are at risk, neither the profits of Red Hot Television nor the tiny minority's wish to watch such pornography count at all. We shall maintain that position forcefully in the European Court and any other court in the future.<br><br>
10.57 am</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Winston Churchill <span class='memberconstituency'>(Davyhulme)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Allowing the programme to go ahead would undoubtedly drive a coach and horses through the Obscene Publications Act 1959 and the Broadcasting Act 1990. As the sponsor of a private Member's Bill entitled the Obscene Publications (Protection of Children, etc.) (Amendment) Bill, which I introduced five years ago—it had more than 10 to one support from colleagues but it ran out of time on Report—I warmly welcome the order.<br><br>
I support the Minister in what he said about children viewing the programme. There is no doubt in any reasonable person's mind that such material would have a damaging effect on children.<br><br>
On the basis of correspondence that I received during the passage of my private Member's Bill, I take issue with the argument that the time of transmission would prevent children from viewing the programme. One person as young as 12 wrote to me saying that marking in the <i>Radio Times</i> or newspaper listings anything a bit racy with a "not suitable for youngsters" warning would be enormously helpful. He said that he is the only member of the family who is capable of operating the timing device on the video cassette recorder. I suspect that that is common in millions of families throughout the land. While dad might fumble with the timing device on his VCR, little Johnny, aged 11 or 12, is a dab hand at it. That young man said that his parents have no idea that, before he goes to bed at 9 pm, he punches in the time on the VCR for the programme that he wants to see and that it would help enormously if the listings showed the material that interested him.<br><br>
No matter the time, no matter that the BBC and ITV making a song and dance about the 9 pm watershed after which children are supposed to be safely tucked up in bed, it is important to appreciate that that is not always effective and that the technical means available in people's homes can ensure that it is not. Children are more than capable of knowing where the decoders are kept and, I suspect, knowing how to operate them. I hope that Her Majesty's Government would not have too much difficulty seeing off any such arguments that may be adduced in court on those lines.<br><br>
Unlike the hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde, I have not had the opportunity of viewing the material. But I am more than prepared to take his word and that of the Minister and, above all, the Broadcasting Standards Council that it is unsuitable. It ill behoves the television authorities to argue, as they persist in doing, that the impact of television on the viewer is so great that sponsors of television programmes are required to pay thousands or even tens of thousands of pounds per minute, and yet to say that not just mildly pornographic but often viciously cruel material will have no effect. I doubt whether any reasonable person would accept that argument.<br><br>
Time and again there are reports of people who are apprehended on rape charges and for other crimes of violence whose homes or lodgings, when searched by the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
police reveal vast quantities of seriously pornographic material. There is little doubt that there is a clear link between the material that is made available to the public and its effects, especially on those who have a drink, drugs dependency or psychological problems. It can often trigger very ugly behaviour by certain members of society. That is why I warmly welcome the measure and especially the fact, as my hon. Friend the Minister made clear, that the persons being criminalised are the purveyors of the filth, not the viewers. I am sure that that is right.<br><br>
Will my hon. Friend clarify what powers are available to the Government to prevent foreign publications from being sold in this country which carry advertisements for the service or for decoders? What powers are available to prevent, for example, mailshots, organised abroad, advertising the services and the decoders? How effective would such a ban be if the material was transimitted from a country outside the EC or via a satellite that was not controlled from an EC country?<br><br>
I should welcome advice on those matters. However, there is no doubt in mind that it would be the strong wish of my constituents that the order is enacted.<br><br>
11.4am</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I apologise for being late. I blame the trains at Mile End. Perhaps, I shall raise that issue when I meet the Minister for Public Transport next week.<br><br>
I support the measure. I agree with the point about children often being more able to set videos than adults. I cannot set my video even though I have the new device on which one presses numbers. I still get it wrong sometimes.<br><br>
The channel should be proscribed. It has already changed its name once—from Red Hot Dutch to Red Hot Television—but what would happen if it changed its name again? Would it be covered by the order or would another be required?<br><br>
I also wish to discuss more general issues. I agree with the principle of proscription of programmes that could cause damage to children in particular. I would also like to see a preparedness to use proscription if racism, violence or bestiality, for example, were being broadcast, however, we must be careful because proscription should not be used for political purposes or to infringe the right of freedom of speech. It might be legitimate for there to be a television channel for gays, which could cover gay and lesbian issues, provided that it was not pornographic in the way that Red Hot Television is pornographic in relation to heterosexuals. Legitimate channels should not be proscribed.<br><br>
I did not hear the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde, but he has whispered to me that the issues are hazy. I agree with him. The provisions that enable us to proscribe satellite channels should be brought into line with the obscenity laws covering other areas. Therefore, the Government should consider producing a code that will stipulate what is not acceptable under any circumstances, against which action could be taken.<br><br>
I agree that it is difficult to extend such a measure to stop the transmission of broadcasts from countries outside Europe. In fact, some companies operate without stating their country of origin, it would be difficult to act against those, but I would be interested to hear the Minister's reply to that.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0835">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
Further work needs to be done. Distasteful as some of the contents of the programmes are, it may not be possible to stop them being broadcast. Perhaps, we should consider how to create equipment that would interfere with the broadcasts. However, a better option may be to tax the broadcasters heavily before they are allowed to broadcast to this country. That may be music to the ear of some Conservative Members. Even though I do not claim that it is the best option, such an approach should be considered.<br><br>
11.9 am</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Congdon <span class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the order. When Red Hot Dutch began broadcasting, many people took the view that it was unlikely that we would be able to ban such a satellite broadcast. Much has been written in journals about the general worries that are associated with the growth of telecommunications and satellite television about what powers will be available in the long term to national Governments to control such broadcasting. I am delighted that the Government have felt able to take action.<br><br>
I agree with the hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde. There is a tangential issue, which is important but not for today's debate: the decision should be for national Governments and nothing to do with whether the Danes, the Italians, the Dutch, the French or the Germans want particular material in their houses. In a democracy, the decision must be one that can legitimately be taken by the United Kingdom.<br><br>
Whether to ban something is difficult to decide. The starting point could be the principle that nothing should be banned—people should be allowed to read and watch whatever they want. There is a danger that one person's standard of what is acceptable and what is not is not that of another person. Having seen Red Hot Dutch in the excellent exhibition that the Metropolitan police put on in the House, I am under no illusion—Red Hot Dutch went outside the bounds of acceptability. To take that further, one can question not just whether it would damage minds; a diet of such material for impressionable adults could also damage people. The evidence from the Metropolitan police of the most violent sexual crimes suggests that, in most cases, the criminal has an amazing amount of pornographic material.<br><br>
There is a world of difference between the material in a television programme such as "Lady Chatterley", which some might liken to a children's tea party, and the material shown by Red Hot Dutch. I hope that I am not proved wrong when the last episode of "Lady Chatterley" is broadcast.<br><br>
I welcomed the description used by my hon. Friend the Minister because it gave the Committee a clear impression of the material that is being discussed. We are not discussing material that goes out on cable channels, which are beamed in from the continent and are pathetic. I do not know if that material could even be called soft porn. Those channels show pathetic films that are broadcast late at night. I say that in passing because I do not want to give the Committee the impression that I am fed on a diet of such films.<br><br>
There is a difference between material that people might find that they do not like—we all have different standards of taste—and material that is potentially damaging to those who would view it.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
On another occasion, the issue of violence may be debated. Some of the most appalling violent material, such as that on the Sky movie channels day in, day out, is damaging, particularly as I have heard of many 12, 13 and 14-year-olds who think nothing of viewing such material.<br><br>
I welcome the decision to ban the material in question. It is a welcome step in the right direction, but I stress that it deals with the hard end of the industry.<br><br>
11.14am</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nirj Joseph Deva <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brentford and Isleworth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I warmly welcome the rationale so cogently presented by my hon. Friend the Minister and also by the hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde. I have received several letters from my constituents arguing that young people should not be allowed to view the channel.<br><br>
I agree with the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, North-East (Mr. Congdon) about violence. There is great concern about rising crime rates and violence. I feel strongly that one reason for the continuing trend in violent crime is because our young children have been fed a diet of violence—sometimes bloodless, as when someone gets shot but no blood is seen—on television. That leads to an anaesthetised reaction to violence, which later creates a culture of violence. We must deal with that problem, but that is a debate for another day.<br><br>
I hope that the European Court will support the Government's case when the hearing is at an end. I hope that the Minister is doing everything that he can to engender the support of our fellow member states in this matter.<br><br>
We are discussing transmissions from a land-based producer uplinking to a satellite. In the fight of the experience of pirate radio, I wonder what might happen in the future if a pirate television producer wanted to take a service to international waters and uplink it to a transponder. It is a fact of scientific history that nothing can be uninvented.<br><br>
I should like to leave the Minister with this thought: perhaps we should consider what we can do not only to the producers of such services, but to the carriers—the companies that own the transponder. They are, in general, substantial, respectable companies which allow time on their transponder to be sold to someone who wants to buy it. Can there be some remit that the transponder owners must consider so that such matters can be better controlled, whether the companies are land-based or offshore?<br><br>
It is important to pass laws that we can enforce, otherwise, through attrition—as happened with pirate radio—we might ultimately be unable to control the situation.<br><br>
11.17 am</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sproat</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate, of rather unusual and gratifying unanimity. As a number of members of the Committee have said, this may lead the way to a wider debate on what is acceptable in terms of obscenity and violence broadcast on radio as well as on television. That debate is not for today, although some interesting markers have been put down for it.<br><br>
I should like to deal with the contributions of hon. Members in the order in which they made them. I entirely agree with the hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde, who
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0836">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
referred to our right as a nation to control such matters. My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, North-East made the same point. The European Community broadcasting directive will be reviewed in 1994, so all the views that have been expressed this morning will be put forward strongly by the Government then. I should have thought that this is certainly a case for the principle of subsidiarity to be strongly considered and—prima facie—not only considered, but accepted.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde said that there needs to be a review of the law as a whole. I do not think that we have such a review in mind, although that is not to say that we should not or will not. However, as I said, a review of the broadcasting directive is already guaranteed.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Davyhulme (Mr Churchill), who has already played such a prominent part in this matter in the House of Commons—to which we all pay tribute—made the very true comment that it is all very well to write into broadcasting directives that if something is broadcast late at night, or encoded or encrypted, children will be prevented from viewing it, but that, in practice, that is piffle. Everybody knows that children, as my hon. Friend rightly said, are usually much more adept at using such machines than adults. The existence of the video and the, presumably, imminent arrival of even more sophisticated technical developments mean that that part of the broadcasting directive is not, in practice, really a safeguard at all. That is why my Department has put very strongly to the divisional court and why it will put strongly to the Luxembourg court our non-acceptance of the measure as a means of safeguarding young people.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Davyhulme also made a point about violence, the extreme importance of which goes beyond that of the order. My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, North-East echoed that. We should direct our attention to violence in the media much more sharply and specifically than we have done.<br><br>
I shall deal shortly with the other matters that were raised by the hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) and the distinction that he very properly drew between censorship and the prevention of activities that are legitimate under the law.<br><br>
I entirely agree that although such matters as were mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Davyhulme, are metaphysical and not susceptible of absolute proof, none the less it is ludicrous - as I believe my hon. Friend said - to claim that the depiction of acts of violence or of other acts on television does not encourage people to follow them, or does not desensitise them or brutalise them. After all, large companies such as Procter and Gamble consider it worth their while to spend £20 million a year on television advertising. It is ludicrous to argue that what is shown on television has no influence on people when companies continue to spend millions of pounds to have items advertised on television. My hon. Friend made an important point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Churchill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for the forceful way in which he made that point. I merely add that the all-party sponsors of my private Member's Bill and I reached a clear conclusion, having gone into the matter in some detail with the obscene publications squad of Scotland Yard, that even more corrosive than some of the harder forms of pornography in its potential impact on
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
susceptible members of society was violence and, above all, vicious cruelty. Those susceptible members of society would, of course, include not just those who are under age, but adults as well.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sproat</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes another good point. He and my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, North-East mentioned that often when the villain in a case of serial rape or similar crime is apprehended or convicted, the police find that his flat or house is stuffed with pornographic magazines or videos. Although it cannot be proved absolutely that had the perpetrator of the serial rapes never watched a pornographic video he would not have committed the crimes, society has the right to argue that the two events coexist and that there is so much likelihood of a direct link that it is entitled to protect children and women in particular against such things.<br><br>
My hon. Friend asked what powers we had to do anything about such matters. The powers are set out fairly broadly in section 178 of the Broadcasting Act 1991. Members of the Committee will no doubt wish to refresh their memories, but I shall outline the provision. Acts from which prosecution can arise include the supply of equipment or goods for use in connection with the operation or day-to-day running of a proscribed service or the provision of programme material—which can, by the way, include programme material that is not pornographic. Sending one's happy family video of fun on the beach to Red Hot Television is an offence, even though the film's content is acceptable. Therefore, the measure is pretty tight.<br><br>
Anyone who incites or suggests to people that they should supply such material is also guilty of an offence. Anyone who advertises the programme or advertises on the programme is guilty of an offence. Those who are found guilty of committing such offences are subject to up to six months' imprisonment in a magistrates court and to two years and a fine of up to £5,000 in a Crown court. My hon. Friend may think that those are not severe penalties and that we should reconsider them. However, two years and £5,000 are the maximum penalties at present.<br><br>
My hon. Friend wondered what would happen if one of the broadcasting stations operated outside the European Community. My hon. Friends the Members for Croydon, North-East and for Brentford and Isleworth (Mr. Deva) also raised that issue. I shall come to the point about sea-based transmission in a moment. There are two answers to the question of what happens outside the European Community. First, if the station is outside the European Community but within Europe, the Council of Europe can, in its equivalent of a directive, ban pornography. Unhelpfully, it does not define pornography. We have to meet the three criteria of the ITC telling us that it is wrong, of the Secretary of State believing that it is wrong, and of fulfilling our international obligations, which in this case would be Council of Europe obligations.<br><br>
Secondly, we should have no problem in banning material from countries outside the European Community and Europe, such as the United States. That answers one of the points made by the hon. Member for Leyton. We should proscribe such material because there are no international obligations that would prevent us from doing so. My hon. Friend the Member for Brentford and Isleworth wondered what would happen if stations started
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0837">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
to broadcast offensive material by radio from out at sea. We could proscribe that as well because we have no international obligations with the vessels in question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Deva</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was really wondering about stations using off-shore faculties to produce television programmes—beaming them up and then beaming them down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sproat</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, I thought that my hon. Friend was referring to an updated livelier version of Radio Caroline. My hon. Friend makes an important point. The same principle applies. Such a service would be proscribed by us because we do not have international obligations with the sea.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Churchill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend the Minister answer my point about foreign magazines containing advertisements that are sold in this country? Will they be subject to seizure or a ban? What is to prevent individuals from another European Community country or from outside the Community from sending mailshots to people in this country soliciting through advertising material for the programme and for decoders?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sproat</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend, with his usual prescience, has asked the question that I was just about to answer. Although speedy, my answer is not satisfactory. We do not have the powers that, in many ways, we wish to have to deal with that matter. A person can be said to commit an offence only if he or she is in the United Kingdom when he or she commits it. We cannot take extra-territorial powers. However, we are currently consulting Customs and Excise to determine whether we can prohibit the import of decoders. I imagine that the same applies to magazines that contain the advertisements, although that would be trickier because the advertisements would be such a small part of the magazines. I would certainly want to tighten up the law on the matter and to include consideration of it in the 1994 review, where relevant. If it is not relevant to that review, we must consider what action to take about my hon. Friend's general points.<br><br>
I shall now deal with the interesting remarks of the hon. Member for Leyton. He asked whether a change of name would make any difference. I am sure that he had in mind terrible cases in which United Kingdom Companies—often double glazing companies—undertake a job for poor old age pensioners, do a boss job, take the money, run away, change their names and reincorporate themselves. The age pensioners then have no redress against them.<br><br>
I take seriously the apparently passing point that a change of name could make a difference, but I am advised that in this case, it could not. We would proscribe the content of the broadcast, not the name of the company responsible for it. I shall check the matter in more detail than I have been able to since the Gentleman spoke and if the truth is different from what I have just told him I shall let him know.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman made an important point about the grave moral difficulties into which we enter when we examine the question. Clearly there is universal agreement that obscenity, bestiality, racism or incitement to violence should not be broadcast. They are all partly covered by article 22. Sexual matters are covered as far as minors are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
concerned but not as far as adults as concerned. However, another part of article 22, not specifically concerned with obscenity, says,
<br><blockquote><p>"member states shall also ensure that broadcasts do not contain any incitement of hatred on grounds of race, sex, religion or nationality."</p></blockquote>
The point made by the hon. Member for Leyton is not wholly covered. To take a rather gruesome example at random, bestiality to people who are not minors does not appear to be covered by the article. His point that we want to ban obscenity but not things that are not against the law in this country is covered. In practice, the article gives the protection he seeks. We would want to consider the matter in more detail. In the 1994 review we shall examine such matters.<br><br>
I agree with the hon. Member for Leyton that it should not be illegal to portray on a satellite beaming into this country anything that is legal in this country. That links with the point of the hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde about subsidiarity. I hope that I have covered the points made by the hon. Member for Leyton.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, North-East echoed the point about pornographic material found in the homes of criminals and so on. That is an important piece of evidence in a case that will ultimately always be unprovable. However, society still has to make a decision. He also made the point that a distinction must be drawn between "Lady Chatterly" on the BBC, which I admit I have not seen, and Red Hot Television. That is right. When one gets into the grey areas one has a problem.<br><br>
Like the hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde, I had to go through a diet of such garbage in order to speak in this debate. I was quite surprised about what could be shown on the Adult channel between midnight and 4 am. Although apparently the ITC and the BSC are happy at the moment with what the Adult channel purveys, a close eye should be kept on it to ensure that it does not stray further and further. There is a creeping encroachment in such matters. One step is taken on day one and no one says anything, so a week later, another step is taken. I hope that the appropriate bodies and the House will keep a sharp eye on what the Adult channel gets up to and will ensure that it does not go too far towards what is being banned on Red Hot Television.<br><br>
I strongly agree with what has been said by my hon. Friend the Member for Brentford and Isleworth and other hon. Members about violence. It is true that it is as dangerous and objectionable as obscenity. If what has happened in other countries is examined, it is clear what should be done. To slightly misuse the words of Aneurin Bevan, "Do not bother to read the crystal ball, just read the book." In this case, the book would be about rap gangster violence videos in the United States, which are now a terrific diet for people there and encourage the brutalisation and desensitisation of large sections of the community.<br><br>
Research in the United States has shown that many youngsters are now influenced more by rap gangster videos and their peers' acceptance of them than by their families. I hope that that will never happen in this country. Today, we are making a small safeguard against such creeping sleazification and brutalisation of life. The American journalist, John Reed, witnessed the Russian revolution in 1917—my hon. Friend the Member for Davyhulme will correct me if I am wrong—and said that he had seen the future and it worked. In this case, if 42nd Street and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0838">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
Broadway are examined, one sees the future—and it stinks. The Government want to ensure that what has happened in the United States does not happen in this country. On that cheery note, I shall conclude.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister responded to my call for a review, I searched for something that I read in <i>The Times</i> on Tuesday 2 February. I have found it. <i>The Times</i> stated that John Major. I assume by that it means our Prime Minister - has called for a review of the law. The Minister may want to follow up the story and discover whether a review will take place, and whether the Committee's debate has acted as an encouragement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sproat</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the hon. Gentleman has made a good point. Although I have not been involved so far in what the Prime Minister is doing, I have seen letters that he has</span></p>
