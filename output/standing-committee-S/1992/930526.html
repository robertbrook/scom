	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='legislation'>Draft Alcan Aluminium UK Ltd. (Rateable
<br><br><!-- lb --> Values) (Scotland) Order 1993</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Scotland (Mr Allan Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Alcan Aluminium UK Ltd. (Rateable Values) (Scotland) Order 1993.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the agreement of the Committee, it will be convenient to discuss at the same time the other orders before us, namely, the draft Caledonian MacBrayne Limited (Rateable Values) (Scotland) Order 1993 and the draft Forth Ports plc (Rateable Values) (Scotland) Order 1993.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The order relates to the valuation of Alcan Aluminium UK Ltd., formerly British Alcan Primary and Recycling Ltd. This order would normally have been included with the bulk of the formula-valued companies which were debated and approved by the House in March. However, a change in the company's name required the original draft to be withdrawn, amended and relaid. Notification was received too late for this order to be included with those orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order prescribes the rateable value for qualifying lands and heritage of the company for 1993–94. It updates the prescribed rateable value for the defined lands and heritages for this year to take account of material change in circumstances and the revised level of industrial derating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the Committee that the order has been subject to consultations with the company, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the Scottish Assessors Association, and no substantive comments have been received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other two orders before us prescribed rateable values for 1993–94 for the operational lands and heritages of Forth Ports plc and Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd. Forth Ports and CalMac are treated separately from other statutory dock and harbour authorities because in each case the land involved spans more than one valuation area. Consequently, the valuations for the two undertakings are calculated not by individual assessors from different authorities, but centrally, following the same method as is applied to other statutory port authorities, then apportioned among the local authorities concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The method of assessment, as hon. Members are aware, is to assess rateable value at 9 per cent. of the relevant income of the authority. Apportionment is on the basis of the relevant income for each area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The assessments and provisions in the orders have been subject to consultations with the local authorities concerned, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the Scottish Assessors Association, and they are content with the provisions. The orders are not controversial, and I commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
	<p>4.34 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish: 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no comments to make on the order concerning Alcan, but I wish to comment on the other two orders which are crucial to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the first Committee that I have attended when you have been in the Chair, Mr. Jones, and I hope that there will be many more such opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our debate is important because we are discussing an order which takes rateable values and apportions them throughout the adjoining district and island councils. It is an exercise in open government—an exercise dealing with an order which may be minor to some but which allocates hard cash to those authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We find it deplorable that, this afternoon when we are discussing that order, in open house, in Committee, a parliamentary question from the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson) has been answered by the Secretary of State for Scotland. Today is the last full day before Parliament rises for Whitsun so we have no chance to debate that answer, which confirms that the Government are about to embark on a review of current activities and are considering the possiblility of privatising Caledonian MacBrayne's routes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want your guidance, Mr. Jones: why do we have double standards in the House of Commons? We have the shabby behaviour of the Secretary of State who answers a parliamentary question on the last full day before Whitsun; at the same time, there is a facility and a procedure to debate an order of less significance. It is important to make that point, and I am grateful for your indulgence, Mr. Jones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will respond to my comments and to those of my hon. Friends, because we cannot carry on like this. I want to protest strongly, that there is little point in the Secretary of State or his Ministers talking about taking stock or about the future of the union when the Opposition are treated in such a shabby manner. If the Secretary of State cannot work by the rules and procedures of the House, what hope is there of discussing new rules and procedures for dealing with Scottish issues, whether at Westminster or in Edinburgh?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister takes our message to the Secretary of State and that we shall not face the unfortunate problem of wanting to discuss the future of the islands and their ferry services, but having to discuss this little order while the big picture is obscured by stealth, owing to the Secretary of State's unfortunate behaviour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has just said that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has broken the rules of the House. [Hon. Members: "No!"] Those were the words that the hon. Gentleman used. I do not believe that my right hon. Friend has done that—he has stuck to the House rules. Will the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The response from my hon. Friend suggests that I did not use those words. I said that the House has rules and procedures and that there is little point in discussing improvements to the government of Scotland if the Secretary of State continues to treat the Opposition in such a contemptuous manner. That is not good for parliamentary business or for the people of the islands who consider the ferries to be their life-blood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today, we have the stark contrast between a Committee discussing an order about Caledonian MacBrayne and the sneaking through by stealth—on the final full day before
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0823">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
the recess—of a major statement, in the guise of a written answer, which deals with the future of the islands and suggests that their ferries may be on the road to privatisation. That is a real issue and it is why I am protesting strongly to the Minister. He should discuss the problem with the Secretary of State and ensure that, if the Government want to have talks in the future on any subject, this must not endure. The House will not be treated with contempt and Her Majesty's Opposition will not suffer such treatment much longer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ray Michie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll and Bute)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Usually, as the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) said, these orders go through each year without much controversy. I am acutely aware of that because I have attended such Committees year on year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to support the comments of the hon. Member for Fife, Central and to register my indignant protest at what has happened. I have only just seen the answer to the written question, which, as the hon. Gentleman said, appears just as the House goes into recess, it is disgraceful that we have been subjected to such behaviour on the part of the Government. I could obtain no information from the Scottish Office last week about rumours that something like this might happen. That information is set out in this response to a written question by a Conservative Back Bencher. The islanders and the people in the Kyle peninsula will be horrified that the Government have returned to this proposition, having discarded it in 1988, after a massive protest meeting. At that time, the Government met representatives of the islanders, who clearly spelt out their total opposition to any thought of Caledonian MacBrayne's being privatised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister cared to read recent evidence that was given by Caledonian MacBrayne to the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs when it was examining transport links in Scotland, he would understand that the company continues to make progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government owe an apology, not only to Scottish Members and to members of the Committee, but to people of the highlands and the islanders who are served by Caledonian MacBrayne.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Calum MacDonald 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Western Isles)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This planted written answer is of great relevance to the Committee because one of its implications is that if privatisation goes ahead, by the time that the Committee meets again, CalMac might not exist in its—current form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way the answer was slipped out was extremely devious and sneaky. The Scottish Office and Ministers know that there is much interest among hon. Members who represent constituencies that will be affected by the announcement. It is not only bad manners but bad government not to have the courtesy to let hon. Members know about the Government's intentions. It would have been easy enough for the Scottish Office to oblige, as it knows the significance of this announcement for Scottish members. For it not to have had the consideration to let them know that this announcement was to be made this afternoon, reveals two things: first, the Scottish Office's contempt for the feelings of islanders and local communities about privatisation; secondly, its lack of confidence in its own announcement. With the prospect of privatisation, it found it necessary to slip out the announcement in this underhand manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
If the Government had any faith in their proposals, which I presume they are keeping in the bottom drawer, they would not fear consulting hon. Members or letting hon. Members know that the announcement was due. That they did not do that shows contempt not only for hon. Members but for the communities that will be affected, and a lack of faith and confidence in their own policies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Kynoch 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is speaking as if my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has already decided to privatise Caledonian MacBrayne. The hon. Gentleman has also referred to my right hon. Friend's attitude towards his constituents. However, in his written answer, my right hon. Friend clearly states that he sees
	<br><blockquote><p>"greater efficiency and effectiveness in the subsidy and service provision",</p></blockquote>
and that he wants
	<br><blockquote><p>"to make it clear that our overall aim is to ensure that services are maintained and improved, and not in any way downgraded."</p></blockquote>
The Secretary of State only seems to be announcing that he is instigating reviews and that he will invite consultants to tender for the necessary studies to inform those reviews. Is that so bad, bearing in mind that the recess that we are talking about is not the summer recess but one that lasts only a week?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I remind hon. Members that we are debating the orders? I have allowed some latitude, but I should like hon. Members to keep well within the bounds of the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Jones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Secretary of State had confidence in the assertions made by the hon. Gentleman, he would not have felt the need to sneak out the announcement. The fact that he did so on the last full day before the recess shows his lack of faith in these proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to say that the recess is only a week long. The hon. Gentleman makes it sound as though we are going away for the whole summer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The orders are of economic importance. The money that CalMac gives local authorities is obviously useful to the authorities, but it pales by comparison with the overall contribution that CalMac makes to the economy and to social well-being of the islands that it services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
CalMac increased its turnover by 50 per cent. by carrying an extra 2 million passengers over the past 10 years. It required less subsidy last year than it did in 1982. The notion that the cost-efficiency of CalMac can be called into question is simply laughable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only way that the Scottish Office will be able to save money if it pursues these proposals will be by reducing the service provided to the islands, by increasing the fares or by a combination of the two, which I suspect is the most likely option. Those measures will have a devastating effect on the islands and the local communities. That is why the proposals will be as bitterly resisted now as they were when they were previously discussed. If the Secretary of State proceeds with the proposals he will face a backlash on the islands, which will take demonstrations of people's outrage to the very doors of the Scottish Office in Edinburgh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I deplore the way in which the announcement has been made. I believe that the response to it will ensure that the proposals are consigned, once and for all, to the dustbin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.47 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Kennedy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ross, Cromarty and Skye)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Jones, for recognising me—I did not want to stretch your celtic tolerance any further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My remarks, like those of the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) and my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie), will focus on the Caledonian MacBrayne order. I endorse what other hon. Members have said about our sense of dismay and anger at the way in which the ancillary announcement about the future of the services has been made. For those of us who are Scottish Members and who, in the course of the session, have been sold the taking-stock exercise, that sits uneasily and unhappily. During this week before the recess, rail privatisation has been argued in the full colour and lighting of the Floor of the House of Commons, and yet here is a possible ferry privatisation, which affects the highlands and islands of Scotland, being slipped through the backdoor as a proposal for consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The late Robert Adley described rail privatisation as the "poll tax on wheels". Those of us who represent the communities affected by the possible privatisation of the ferry services will leave the Government in no doubt that, for them, it will be the poll tax on water.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I represent the area serviced by Caledonian MacBrayne's Kyle of Lochalsh to Kyleakin service. Part of the order mentions operational land in relation to the Company-land that is used for the purposes of carrying on the company's undertaking. That is relevant because when the Skye bridge is completed—it will be a poll-funded bridge, privately built in the teeth of local opposition to its funding—Caledonian MacBrayne will be prohibited by the Secretary of State, as the principal shareholder, from operating that ferry service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, Caledonian MacBrayne says that because of the economic situation of the company, it will, in times to come, be prevented from operating the Kyle of Lochalsh to Kyleakin service, of which the Secretary of State is the major shareholder. It is the company's most profitable route and as such it subsidises many of the other routes to the islands in the constituencies of my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll and Bute and the hon. Member for Western Isles. The Secretary of State at present exercises his majority shareholding interest in a nationalised concern. Under this order, there will be a significant knock-on effect on the pricing of ferry services to those islands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, as the hon. Member for Western Isles said, the level of subsidy to the Caledonian MacBrayne has steadily declined in the past decade. That has been confirmed by the Scottish Office in the past few weeks in reply to written questions about the Skye bridge. It is a tribute to the company that it has been able to maintain a viable service in many of those communities despite the steady erosion of funds from the public purse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the overall withdrawal of subsidy, the prohibition that will be put on the company in respect of its most profitable route, the loss of profits on other services, and the toll to be levied on the Skye bridge under the terms of the deal agreed between the Scottish Office and the contractor, which will be index-linked to the price of the ferry crossing, it is all the more financially, socially and politically disgraceful that this order has been tabled in the political context of a backdoor announcement—without
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
informing hon. Members who represent communities that will be affected by the implications of the consultation document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have never heard such nonsense in all my puff. It is just bluster. Opposition Members are crying crocodile tears. They know that whatever options are proposed by the review, they will be fully debated. Opposition Members make a political argument out of every issue. We are discussing a statutory instrument, yet they have raised an issue that is irrelevant. The Government have used the normal means to present information to hon.

There was no reason to hide behind such a statement, because now that it is public and now that we are approaching the recess, Labour Members will without a doubt try to publicise it throughout that period, when the press has nothing better to do than pick up irrelevancies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that this matter is another case of the Opposition's doing nothing but scaremonger, trying to make people on the islands fear that the Secretary of State intends to reduce the service, when it is clear from the answer that he has given that he intends to improve and maintain the service? Does my hon. Friend agree that the Opposition's reaction is horrific?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with my hon. Friend, and I draw attention to the fact that Opposition members are expert at singling out irrelevancies and developing them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman tell us how he became aware of the existance of the written answer this afternoon? Was it through his usual daily trawl of the Order Paper or was he tipped off by a Minister or one of his hon. Friends?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentlemam that my way of finding out was no different from his. I had no tip-off; I was not aware of it. However, I would expect, when the Government are considering options and change, that they would present them in a reasonable manner. All that has happened is that a review has been announced; we will have plenty of time for debate. The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) referred to the comparison with railway privatisation—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind hon. Members, especially the hon. Member who has the Floor, that we are debating three orders. I expect the hon. Gentleman to keep in order while he makes his speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we are reviewing statutory instruments such as this one, which do not have much content, I would expect people to keep to the point. I fully acknowledge the Chair's comments. Reviews such as the one announced this

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
afternoon do not always bring change. The hon. Member for Fife, Central suggested that this could be the last statutory instrument to mention Caledonian MacBrayne. That is not likely; a lot of water has to go under the bridge before then and many Caledonian MacBrayne sailings will have taken place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye suggested that a comparison could be made with the community charge. My personal view is that many in the community regret the passing of that charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest, when taking stock of these statutory instruments, that the larger issues be considered in the additional Scottish Grand Committees. I hope that some of those Grand Committees will be held in the islands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman say that privatising CalMac would be as good an idea as the poll tax?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not in a position to say that; I have not had the opportunity to study the review that the Secretary of State is to undertake. I do not know what will be in it, so I cannot answer the hon. Gentleman's question. We want less bluster and more business in this Committee, to clear these statutory instruments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.13 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no direct constituency interest in Caledonian MacBrayne, nor am I a member of the Committee, although any hon. Member is entitled to speak. I declare an interest: I am a regular user of the Caledonian MacBrayne service to the island of Arran, where I regularly holiday. I therefore have an interest in the matter and some knowledge of what the island's reaction will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourteen Members of the national Parliament of the United Kingdom have come together to discuss orders which no national Parliament should consider. They are basically matters for local government or regional assemblies; they should not be debated here. What we are debating is, essentially, irrelevant. I have debated the matter before in Committee with the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), and made exactly the same point. We should not be here; these are unnecessary orders which should be decided in another way. Yet here we are, while at the same time, a fundamentally important matter that relates to one of the companies that we are discussing is pushed through the House of Commons in a written answer. What a farce that is. We should be listening to the Secretary of State make a statement on the Floor of the House about what he intends to do with Caledonian MacBrayne, Scottish Members, especially those with a constituency interest, should be able to ask the Secretary of State about his intentions and about the way in which the review will be undertaken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not sufficient to say that this is just a review. A review was conducted only five years ago: why is it necessary to conduct one again? Has Caledonian MacBrayne proved to be a highly inefficient company? Are its services not operated properly? Have its passenger numbers fallen away, and does it not carry the freight at the proper prices? The answer to all those questions is no. As my hon. Friends have noted, Caledonian MacBrayne has improved its services dramatically over the past five years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
Why has the review been undertaken? The Government are driven by the dogma of privatisation. Anything that is publicly owned must be put into private hands. With Caledonian MacBrayne, that will happen regardless of the impact on the people in the islands. If privatisation takes place, I wonder how many orders will have to be made. Instead of debating the rateable values of one company, Caledonian MacBrayne, we shall have to debate the values for five or six different companies. Orders will be necessary for all of them. The Committee will meet and discuss those rateable values, but probably there will never be a proper opportunity to debate the review of privatising CalMac itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal is a farce. The islanders have made it clear repeatedly that they do not want it. Unlike most privatisations, the management of CalMac violently opposes it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the hon. Member that we are debating three orders that are narrowly drawn. I advise him that he is straying somewhat and ask him to restrict his remarks to the orders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The three orders, and especially that involving Caledonian MacBrayne, relate to the piers and harbours owned by that company. They deal with the amount of tax that must be paid to each local authority in connection with that property. Given the possibility that those piers and harbours will be handed to different organisations and companies, we are entitled to ask the Minister for an explanation of what will happen to those properties when their ownership changes. Clearly, the rateable value may change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman explain how we can debate something that has not been decided yet? He suggests that we should debate the fate of the piers and harbours when their ownership changes, but how is that possible until the review has been carried out? How can we debate an outcome that may never happen?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know the Government of old. Reviews such as this are not undertaken without a pretty good idea of what they are trying to achieve. The Government are testing the water and estimating the amount of opposition. That will help them make up their mind as to whether they should go ahead and privatise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are putting down the initial markers today. We know the level of opposition among the people. Not all of them are automatic Labour or Liberal Democrat supporters: the people on the Isle of Arran are proof of that. That opposition shows that people feel strongly that CalMac must stay in public hands. It must remain a public company that is able to cross-subsidise and to use its vessels to ensure a proper service when one breaks down. That would not happen with a private company. We are putting down markers and making it clear that we consider that the announcement of the review is underhand and partial and would not have been undertaken by a Government who respected parliamentary democracy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.20 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) should be congratulated on demonstrating again his work rate by turning up for a Committee of which he is not a member, although he is entitled to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0826">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
We have heard what might be described as one of the usual Scottish pre-recess fusses. The genuiness of Opposition anxiety is perhaps best demonstrated by the fact that of the seven Scottish Labour Members allocated to the Committee, only two have turned up. If the Scottish parliamentary Labour party is genuine in its outrage, where, I ask the hon. Member for Fife, Central, are the other five? I am glad to note that in general the technical content of the orders is not a matter of great dispute between us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I deal with the two points raised by hon. Members that relate specifically to the technical content of the orders, let me confirm, in answer to questions about the timing—it is alleged that that is yet another outrage against parliamentary democracy—that this debate has taken place at about the same time in the parliamentary Session year after year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Western Isles alleged that the privatisation of CalMac would mean the end of these orders. I must point out to him that the other order under consideration today is the Forth Ports order. It may be news to the hon. Gentleman, but the Fort Ports authority is privatised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye alleged that there was a relationship between the Kyle-Kyleakin ferry service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way on a technical point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That makes a change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If, for instance, the route between Ardrossan and Arran were privatised separately under one company, the orders would not be necessary because only one local authority would be involved. Therefore, there would be no necessity of an order covering many local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The orders would be necessary as the rateable valuation would still have to be prescribed, generally or specifically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister misses the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Turning to the point of the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye and Kyle and Kyleakin, I can tell him, if he does not know, that the two terminals are owned by Highland regional council. Therefore, the order does not apply to the Kyle-Kyleakin ferry service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not dispute the ownership of the land sites for the ferry service. However, does the Minister dispute the points that I have made or, more pertinently, that the management of Caledonian MacBrayne have made about the physical and political shareholding prohibition that the Secretary of State has placed on that company in discontinuing its ferry services on the crossing, in competition with any bridge that may be built, and about the knock-on effect to its services on other routes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is true that when the Kyle bridge is open, the ferry service will be withdrawn and CalMac will lose the revenue. However, CalMac operates 26 different services, not all of which are rateable, and it believes that it should be able to offset the loss of the Kyle-Kyleakin service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is a point that relates specifically to the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does, but obviously the Minister has engaged the considerable talents—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Member will not tempt the Minister out of order in his reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I should never tempt the Minister. I was just interested in the Minister's use of the word "offset". Will he clarify what "offset" means? I assume that offsetting the losses means the company tranferring them to ferry services on the Isle of Bute and the Western Isles. That will mean higher passenger fares.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would stand by the word. I do not think I can go further than that and it would not be proper for me to do so because that information is commercially confidential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the other point made by the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye. He compared parliamentary conduct for the Report stage of the Railways Bill on the Floor of the House with that for the statement made by the Secretary of State on the review of CalMac, saying that the latter was an outrage compared with the right and proper consideration of the Bill. He said that the review was not conducted in the same way and hon. Members have alleged that the statement has been sneaked out and that it is not subject to parliamentary procedure. I congratulate Opposition Members on keeping their faces straight when making their allegations. The statement was made entirely in accordance with parliamentary procedure. It came in a written answer that is available to hon. Members. As my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) pointed out, the House is entering upon only a short recess.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key point is that the Government remain committed to providing continued financial support for lifeline shipping services, to ensure that services can be provided at a cost to users that is consistent with the need to maintain and improve economic, and social conditions in the islands. I should have thought that Opposition Members would welcome such a commitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members asked whether we shall have the opportunity to debate the review on future occasions. Of course, there will be an opportunity to debate the results of the review on the Floor of the House, in the Scottish Grand Committee or in whatever forum is appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repudiate the allegations made by Opposition Members. With, I hope, their support, I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.28 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are used to characteristically robust comments from the Minister. However, he will agree that, after 14 years of Tory Government, there is a trifle of insensitivity and contempt creeping into their activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has, to use a well-worn cliché, been important. It highlights what we should look for in parliamentary democracy. It is vital for the constituents whom my hon. Friends represent to have an opportunity to tackle serious issues in the House when they arise. Through your generosity and tolerance, Mr. Jones, we have been able to flag up the fact that some of us seriously believe that there is a role for parliamentary democracy and that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0827">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
constituency interests should be taken care of. By now, I should have thought that we should see some humility from a party that is now managing to achieve the dizzy heights of 16 per cent, of the vote in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would finish on that point, but we want to make a clear protest so that the Minister is aware that such shabby behaviour will not do. It must end. Whatever the Whip thinks the figures may be, we want to divide the Committee symbolically on the Caledonian MacBrayne order, to make a point within the traditions and conventions of the House. If this is the last effort before the recess, there is no further action that we can take on the Floor of the House. I rest our case there, and hope that our point has been made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
