	<section>
	<div class='legislation'>Draft Civil Defence (General Local Authority Functions) (Scotland) Regulations 1993</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary-Under Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Civil Defence (General Local Authority Functions) (Scotland) Regulations 1993.</p></blockquote>
I justify the regulations briefly in a personal way by pointing out that my conviction in them was instilled into me when I and the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) visited Lockerbie a few hours after the disaster there. At that time, all we saw was a crater where houses had been and in which people had been living a few hours earlier. In addition, there was the nightmare of bodies having rained out of the sky. The way that the local authority performed in those circumstances was extremely impressive. Every day, it had to feed more than 1,000 volunteers in local schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In peacetime emergencies as well as in other types of emergencies, broader-based planning is needed. There is a reduced threat assessment of the prospect of nuclear war. Therefore, it is appropriate that much broader planning should be in place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the things that worries people such as myself about emergencies is that local authorities and the other authorities involved have to put aside money, people and expertise to deal with so-called VIPs who turn up for no purpose other than to have their photographs taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Whether VIPs have their photographs taken hardly constitutes a civil defence matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. It is part of civil defence these days that local authorities, police authorities and so on have to set aside money and experts to deal with VIPs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Braer incident brings out the hon. Gentleman's point. At that time, 800 media people went to the Shetlands. That is part of the overall planning that the local authority must face. I would not categorise myself as a VIP, but I went to the Shetlands some months later when I knew that I would not be in the way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Tayside flooding is an example of where planning is necessary. In that case, the foresight of the local authority prevented deaths. The flood banks broke and the water rose by 7 to 9 feet. People would have been drowned if the Army, in co-operation with the local authority, had not taken the necessary measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The precise obligations placed on local authorities by the 1983 regulations are no longer appropriate. Now the key is flexibility in planning so that an adequate response can be
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
given to any eventuality. That approach will be strongly welcomed by all local authorities. Similar regulations have been accepted for the rest of Britain. I warmly commend the regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.33 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not my wish to detain the Committee long. Despite his usual modesty, we always regard the Under-Secretary of State as a very important person. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] I thought that that remark would meet with that response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations govern the regime in local authorities to cater for civil defence. I want to raise some concerns about the transportation of nuclear weapons. As the Minister will be aware, in January 1993, the Ministry of Defence published new regulations covering contingencies for the transportation of nuclear weapons. For the first time, the Ministry of Defence seemed to accept that such weapons existed and were transported around Britian, and, in particular, around Scotland and the Faslane base. That said, the Ministry's acceptance that there was a potential problem was a step forward. That is why the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the local authorities were keen to discuss the guidance document published by the Ministry of Defence. A number of issues have been raised about which I hope to receive reassurances from the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We may be entering an era of more open and honest dialogue between the Ministry of Defence, the Scottish Office and local authorities. In the past when worries about the transportation of nuclear weapons were expressed by local authorities, they were often met by the standard response, which is noted in a COSLA paper, Protective Services Item No. 4.3, published in June. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is not the policy of HM Government to confirm or deny the existence of nuclear weapons".</p></blockquote>
Such a reply is ludicrous, especially when the local authorities and the public were not only aware of nuclear weapons travelling through their areas, but on many occasions saw them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A problem has been that the training that local authoritiy staff have been involved in has been geared to something happening to a nuclear weapon at a nuclear research facility. As yet, there has been no acknowledgement that if a nuclear weapon is involved in an accident on a highway, a different set of problems will be created which have not been addressed by the Government or local authorities because of the constraints within which they have been operating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, there is no point in general orders being passed in the House unless they can be implemented effectively in relation to every aspect of civil defence, including the transportation of nuclear weapons. Will the Minister give an assurance that there will be effective implementation, not only of the regulations, but their relationship to the transportation of nuclear weapons?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the public always need to be reassured about any issue such as this, which is surrounded by huge sensitivities. There have been instances in Scotland during the past few years of the public seemingly not being reassured. Indeed, they have met the brick wall of the Ministry of Defence. People appreciate what is happening on the highways and streets around their towns, but there was no acknowledgement of that by the Ministry. There have to be reassurances for the public, which can come only
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0592">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
if all concerned acknowledge the problem and are sure that local authorities and the Department have the capabilities effectively to deal with people's worries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third issue is that of finance. Civil defence does not take up an enormous part of local authorities' annual budgets, but there are constraints on local authorities. I hope that the Minister will reassure us that if finance is necessary for training and for creating contexts in which emergency procedures can be carried out, it will be dealt with within an adequate budget from the Scottish Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, I stress the question of open and honest dialogue. In a modern society, I accept the defence implications of nuclear weapons, the sensitivities and the need to ensure that we do not succour terrorist activities. However, there is a need, especially at local authority level, for a dialogue with the local community, particularly in vulnerable areas where it is known that a large number of nuclear weapons travel year in, year out. The west of Scotland particularly springs to mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, as I have said, we welcome the shifting attitudes of the Ministry of Defence to the possible practical implications of transporting nuclear weapons around the United Kingdom, and Scotland in particular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will give the appropriate reassurances and acknowledge that if more weaponry is to be transported around the country in the 1990s, the Government owe it to local people always to be vigilant. More importantly, they should provide the necessary resources to enable proper civil defence precautions to be taken and emergencies to be tackled efficiently and effectively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.40 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) has raised some of the concerns that I wanted to express about the transportation of nuclear weapons. I have one question to add to his. To what extent does civil defence training for the police, fire services and other local authority employees cover the possibility of nuclear war, and how much of it is based on a local crisis or tragedy such as Lockerbie or the Shetland tanker disaster? Where does the emphasis in training lie?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, why are the regulations being introduced now? The explanatory note says that they will replace the Civil Defence (General Local Authority Functions) (Scotland) Regulations 1983. However, it also says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the principal civil defence functions remain with regional and island councils."</p></blockquote>
Unless there is either a statutory obligation on the Government to introduce the regulations now, or a pressing civil defence reason for doing so, why are we, as a Committee, wasting our time discussing something when, if the Government go ahead with their proposals for local government reform in Scotland, the whole procedure will have to be gone through again very soon? All the indications are that two of the present regions will disappear from the map under any local government reform introduced by the Government. Why are we going through this procedure when, in a very short time, the measure will come back in the form of new regulations or as part of a new Bill reforming local government which, we assume, will be introduced some time next year?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that sometimes I come to these Committees even when not invited, Mr. Hogg. One reason is because I have some objections to our secondary legislation procedures.
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Some of them are farcical, and a waste of time; they should not involve the House at all. This measure should not be introduced now. There is a continuing process of consultation on local government reform, and there will be a major local government reform in Scotland. We are considering a measure that should be part of that long-term procedure. Can the Minister convince me that there is a good reason for introducing the regulations now? Does the legislation provide that this procedure should be undergone every 10 years, or do the regulations meet a particular civil defence need?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.42 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a full-blooded member of the Committee, chosen by the Selection Committee, not an invited guest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You will put the responsibility on the Minister, Mr. Hogg, not on me, for raising the subject of Lockerbie. But I shall not stray and abuse that, other than to say that Ministers who raise the subject of Lockerbie had better also raise a number of other concerns that go on and on. Before I voice those concerns, I pay tribute once again to those young policemen who had to clear up the mess. I refer to those from your police force of Strathclyde, Mr. Hogg, from my police force of Lothian, from the police force of my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central and to those of Dumfries and Galloway. The trauma that those young men went through is something that will live with them for ever. I did not go to Lockerbie as a VIP for that reason, and any of us who went there can be under no misapprehension that, as David Leppard put it in his book "The Trail of Terror", it was the most serious crime against civilians in the western world since 1945.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I want to ask once again certain questions about the control of that operation. I do not yet know, immersed as I am in the subject, who was actually in charge. I have made approaches to the distinguished policeman, Mr. Boyd, through Sir William Sutherland, but, perhaps understandably, he would not see me. Therefore, I have been unable to put these questions directly. With the passage of time, it would be interesting to hear his reflections on the control of the operation after the Pan Am plane came down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why was the Bradford police surgeon, Dr. Fieldhouse, who had been involved in the aftermath of the Bradford football stadium disaster and who had volunteered his services, spurned after 36 hours of working with many of the bodies? Who gave the instruction that certain things should be done to those body bags? What exactly were the relations with the farmer, Mr. Wilson, and his family on whose land most of the aircraft crashed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those questions are set out by David Leppard in "The Trail of Terror", by David Johnston in his book and in many well-informed press articles. I register again my gross dissatisfaction with the Crown Office. Indeed, it was that dissatisfaction that led to the events that are generically called Fettesgate in another sphere. The truth is that the circumstances surrounding the Lockerbie incident are deeply unsatisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is becoming clearer that the crime that was Lockerbie was not the responsibility of the two Libyans described to me by Kate Adie, who saw them, as footmen. Those two did not sit down in a cafe and dream up that crime. No one has much doubt that it was dreamt up in Tehran as a result
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0593">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
of the shooting down of the Iranian airliner by the USS Vincennes. I remind the Minister that the celebratory party was not in Tripoli, but in Damascus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The behaviour of the British Government not least the Crown Office toward Libya, is absolutely ridiculous. Libya, which, fools that we are, is one of our best markets, has been used as a whipping boy. The Government should look more carefully at Syria and Tehran. Incidentally, one of the Libyans had close family links with the terrorist gangs of Beirut. I see that you are becoming impatient, Mr. Hogg, but if hon. Members raise the subject of Lockerbie, they must realise how unsatisfactory it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I am smarting from the Foreign Secretary calling me naive on the Floor of the House yesterday, I shall not pursue that and shall concentrate on the particular issues involved. Last month I saw at first hand some of the results of modern weaponry. They are absolutely indescribable. On the first morning that we were in Baghdad, my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galloway) and I were taken round the Amariya, which was a thick concrete shelter built during the Iran-Iraq war. Everyone thought that it was bomb proof. When the American missiles struck, 1,200 civilians were in that shelter. My hon. Friend and I were accompanied by the hard-boiled BBC correspondent, Tim Llewellyn, a veteran with 25 years' experience of the middle east. We were shaken by the result. On the thick concrete shelter we saw carbonated limbs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. Is this account relevant to the civil defence regulations? It may be relevant to civil defence in Iraq, but how is it relevant to civil defence in Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will tell the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. In response to the point of order I should tell the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) that he has been straying a little. I have been generous and, if I understood him correctly, he made the point that he has just made yesterday on the Floor of the House. I also understand that he has Question 1 to the Prime Minister today. I am sure that we shall hear more of the issues. Will the hon. Gentleman now relate his remarks to the regulations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to know what civil defence can do in the face of such modern technology. Emergencies arising from disasters, or the important point very properly raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central about the transport of nuclear weapons, are real problems for us to consider. However, one must ask what civil defence there can be against outside assault. One hopes that such outside assault would never come from America, but in discussions of civil defence and shelters, the fact should be brought home that modern technology and weapons will come into more, and more irresponsible, hands. What can we do about that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to hear from the Minister the philosophy of civil defence. Why are we paying taxpayers' money for something that may have been important in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, but which may have been overtaken by the nature of modern missile technology? If people are afraid of nuclear weapons they had better also be afraid of what goes for modern conventional weapons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
When one sees women holding infants in their arms in the last throes of death, Pompeii-like, one realises what could happen elsewhere. That is my simple point. What is the Government's attitude to civil defence, given that any attack in the old meaning of the word is likely to involve missile technology rather than bombs against which there can be any kind of shelter? That is a legitimate question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.53 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to answer all the points that have been raised this morning. First, the Ministry of Defence has recently issued to all authorities a paper explaining what is involved in the transport of nuclear weapons. The risk of an accident is very remote. The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities has welcomed that paper, but considers that it does not give sufficiently full information. Comments by COSLA and others are being considered by the Ministry of Defence. I shall draw the concern of the hon, Member for Fife, Central to the attention of the Ministry. The Ministry of Defence was conscious of the need to reasure the public about the point raised by the hon. Gentleman and the paper was an important first step.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Each time a transporter carrying a nuclear weapon goes to, or leaves, the Faslane base, travelling through much of the Strathclyde region, are the police, fire authorities and chief executive's office informed? If they do not know about each transportation, their ability to carry out civil defence against a possible accident is non-existent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A special police force is assigned to those duties. I understand that all arrangements are in order, but the hon. Gentleman can, if he wishes, make further inquiries, either through the Department of Transport, about nuclear waste, or through the Ministry of Defence, about Faslane.

With regard to funding, we continue to make grants to authorities at 100 per cent. of the cost of the core activities. Local authorities plan locally to cope with the consequences of any disaster. The consequences are often much the same despite differences in the nature of a disaster. We need the regulations now because it is time that we recognised the end of the cold war and had simpler regulations, which allow authorities full discretion for a broadly-based approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have consulted the authorities about the regulations and we have taken their views into account. Similarly, in the wake of local government reform, we shall consider representations from local authorities about whether further measures are necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What representations has the Minister received from the Ministry of Defence about the transportation of nuclear weapons in relation to local government reform? At the moment, when a transporter carrying nuclear weapons enters Scotland and goes to Faslane, it travels through two local authorities—Dumfries and Galloway regional council and Strathclyde regional council. Under the proposals, as far as we understand them—we do not yet know what the final picture will be—the transporter may have to travel through seven or eight different local authorities, possibly seven or eight different police and fire authorities and the chief executive's office will also be involved. The risks involved in that will be increased markedly by having that number of

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
local authorities involved. Does the Under-Secretary of State agree that that is a good argument for maintaining the present local authority structure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware of any representations from the Ministry of Defence that come within the terms of the hon. Gentleman's question. However, the paper has been issued and the representations are being assessed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On finance, the level of grant to be paid next year will be about £2.8 million, so that will provide strong support. The aim of civil defence is to protect people against any form of hostile attack or to deal with any form of emergency. Accordingly, the end of the cold war does not mean the end of civil defence. It is for Government to assist local authorities in developing arrangements that will be able to cope with a wide range of occurrences, irrespective of their cause. That approach is relevant not only to civil defence, but to the role of local authorities in peacetime disasters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am just coming to the hon. Gentleman's questions. I shall answer them first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Linlithgow asked who was in charge at Lockerbie. The chief constable of Dumfries and Galloway was in overall charge during the immediate response phase. Many activities and organisations had to be co-ordinated and chief constables have recognised that useful lessons were learnt. In the longer terms, the regional council had the primary role. Again, although in general it coped admirably, it has recognised that some lessons can be learnt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister satisfied that the chief constable, Mr. Boyd, had full authority over the Americans and the Central Intelligence Agency?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's question is not relevant to the immediate requirement, which was for volunteers. Those who arrived on the spot immediately were soldiers, ambulancemen, firemen and police officers. They had to deal with the immediate impact of the incident. I am not aware of the particular problem to which the hon. Gentleman referred. However, if he wants to write to me, I shall examine it closely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also raised issues that relate to the Lord Advocate. Criminal investigation goes beyond the scope of the regulations and I shall not enter into that debate. The hon. Gentleman must take up those issues with the Lord Advocate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the regulations as extremely sensible. They have been implemented elsewhere in Britain and will be universally welcomed by local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This will not do. The Minister said that the regulations are concerned with protecting civilians. I reiterate that the Government should think about what they are protecting civilians against. Civilians are not being protected against the sort of bomb, to be personal, of Rudolf Hess' day. The situation is entirely different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I speak not of Iraq. I do not want to abuse the private word that I had with the hon. Member for Broxtowe (Mr. Lester), who is a member of the Committee and has considerable knowledge of Cambodia. I put it in parenthesis that he has made an important contribution to the House on the subject of that country. He knows that
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
modern weaponry is different from anything that has gone before. My question concerns not just Iraq. It may be put in particular terms, but it is a general question. I do not believe that the Scottish Office or other authorities have come to terms with the new nature the problem. Perhaps the Minister will write to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Civil defence cannot prevent disasters, whether they occur in peacetime or are of a warlike nature, but it can considerably mitigate the effects in the interests of the communities concerned. That is universally welcomed by the House of Commons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like the Minister to reflect on what has been said. There may be a full and convincing answer, but that raises the question of value for money. If protection of citizens is being discussed, such protection must be effective and worthwhile. I suspect that money is spent on a number of things that, given modern technology, are not worthwhile, and that it is make-believe and posturing to claim that something can be done about a new situation. The authorities concerned should face up to reality. Reality does not consist of pretending to do that which, given modern technology, cannot be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to irritate hon. Members by going on, but there is a point to be discussed. I hope that the Minister and his officials will address it seriously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made a similar point about the balance in civil defence expenditure and what the civil defence services are somehow supposed to do to defend, or help, people in the event of a nuclear war. It is not only a matter of modern technology. For the past 25 years, large amounts of money have been spent doing things that would not have saved one life and would have been inoperable in the event of a nuclear war. Many people believe that the threat of nuclear war has considerably decreased, if not disappeared. Are enormous sums of money still being spent trying to defend ourselves or on schemes that will either never happen or be useless should a war occur?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Should not money and forces be concentrated on dealing with local crises as they arise and on ensuring that, in the event of another disaster such as Lockerbie, the proper money and manpower are in the right place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Expenditure on civil defence has been reduced, taking into account the reduced threat mentioned by the hon. Gentleman. The total grant will be reduced from £3.3 million this year to about £2.8 million next year. The grant paid to local authorities will be reduced from £2.4 million this year to about £1.7 million next year. A 100 per cent. grant is given and grant is now used for broadly-based planning to cope with the effects of any sort of disaster. In the event of the flooding in Perth, lives were saved. I am convinced of that and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will accept that. All considerations have been taken into account. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still mystified because I do not know what the money is spent on. Is it spent on salaries? Is it spent on hardware, and if so, what sort? We are probably following the deep slumbers of a decided opinion on the matter and a sum of money is allocated to civil defence without it ever being counted. What is the money spent on?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0595">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can only tell the hon. Gentleman what I know from experience, having visited Lockerbie. Many communications have to be made. In that particular case, the countryside had to be searched in order to find the remains of the aircraft and of human beings. More than 1,000 people had to be fed every day. The organisational requirements for such an operation require planning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The cost of Lockerbie did not come out of civil defence allocations; it came out of other things.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Equally, at what point does a disaster cease to be a matter for local police and fire authorities and become a civil defence matter, to be paid for out of this money? Is a fire caused by an IRA bomb a civil defence and not a fire matter? What about an ordinary fire in a warehouse that may cause major damage, or one that is likely to spread pollution? When does payment for such
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
incidents come out of the expenditure of police and fire authorities in the course of their normal function, and when are they considered civil defence matters to be paid for out of these funds, which come via a 100 per cent. grant? Where is the line drawn?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister has properly addressed the questions that Members of the Committee have put to him on the regulations. If hon. Members wish to obtain more detailed information, they should use the written question procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
