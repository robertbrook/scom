	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Scottish Hospital Trust Scheme 1993.</p></q>
The somewhat technical statutory instrument before the Committee updates the scheme that sets out to improve the method of allocating Scottish Hospital Trust endowment income. I should emphasise that the endowments were established before 5 November 1946. In devising the scheme, the main concern was to ensure, as far as possible, an equitable distribution of income among health boards, and among health boards and national health service, where relevant, while maintaining a connection with the original sums endowed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Hospital Trust was established in 1971 and the legislative provision is consolidated in schedule 6 of the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978. Its purpose is to administer and maximise investments from endowments previously managed by regional hospital boards and boards of management. The endowments transferred to the Scottish Hospital Trust were all made before 1947 and predate the establishment of the NHS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The original capital from endowments transferred to the Scottish Hospital Trust is invested by the Trust. Income distributed among health boards is that derived from such investments. The current method of allocating Scottish Hospital Trust income is based on £3 per hospital bed plus a share of the balance, allocated in proportion to the health board's share of the total capital funds as transferred to the Scottish Hospital Trust. Initially, the bed allocation accounted for the main apportionment. However, the bed method now accounts for less than 10 per cent. of the total income allocated to health boards, the investment portfolio having substantially increased in value over the years. At present, the endowment fund is valued at £24.2 million and £1.6 million of revenue derived from the fund was available for distribution among health boards for the year 1991–92. The present system is in need of updating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new scheme will allow for the division of Scottish Hospital Trust income among health boards and NHS trusts on the basis of the originating capital as transferred to the Scottish Hospital Trust in 1972. It will be for health boards and NHS trusts to reach agreement on the identification and final proportion of such capital. Given that the endowments are very old, the schedules held by the secretaries to the Scottish Hospital Trust, currently Messrs. W. & J. Burness, will assist in the process. I should emphasise that the scheme only provides a method for distributing the investment income. The endowments themselves are not being distributed and will still remain under the management of the Scottish Hospital Trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
The new scheme will allow health boards greater freedom in the allocation of Scottish Hospital Trust income, update the method of distribution in force since 1974 and afford NHS trusts relevant endowment income as provided for in the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.34 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his helpful explanation of the statutory instrument. The one-sentence explanatory note on the back page of the document does not explain much, so it was helpful to hear about the proposals in more detail. Some questions remain, however, and I hope that the Minister will answer them this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How many endowment funds are in existence? Am I right in guessing that some bequests go back to pre-1947 days and are very old? For example, it is possible that there are bequests in wills from Victorian days to help the sick. Old bequests might not have much capital. What will be the total annual value to be distributed from the endowments? Will the holding trusts continue to decide how much will be distributed from each endowment each year?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister explained how the sum will be divided between the health boards and the NHS trusts or trusts within the health board's area. That will be agreed on the basis of the percentage of capital funds pertaining to those bodies. Failing agreement, how will the Secretary of State decide between them? Will he have room for discretion which, in the case of this Government, would be exercised in favour of the trusts? Or will that decision be purely an objective accounting exercise performed by an appropriately qualified civil servant and signed by the Secretary of State with no thought or real involvement—a bit like the blank bits of paper that we have been hearing about recently?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, what will the income be used for when it is divided? When I was looking into this, I noticed that there is a research trust which is a separate body. Have the funds of the research trust been dispersed through health boards and to trusts in health board areas or will that happen in future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.37 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Chisholm 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Leith)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must admit that I am slightly disappointed: I was a little naive, I suppose, in that I thought that the Scottish Office was going to let us discuss the issue of hospital trusts in Scotland. [Hon. Members: "The hon. Gentleman would not have come if he had known."] I assure hon. Members that I would have come anyway because of my interest in such matters. All that that issue was considered worthy of was a written answer a day before the Christmas holidays. It is ironic that this technical matter should have had to come before a Committee when the important question of the establishment of many trusts was not even discussed in the House. No doubt every hospital in Scotland will be turned into a trust over the next two years without our views and those of the people of Scotland being taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everybody knows that the consultations reveal overwhelming popular opposition to that happening. But
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0681">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
all those views have been put in the dustbin and the preordained view of the Scottish Office has been implemented. We all know that the grand plan for turning Scottish hospitals into trusts was drawn up at the general election and that the dates when that will happen for each hospital have been decided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Winterton. We are getting into a discussion about hospital trusts and NHS trusts. The statutory instrument is not about that. Perhaps that misapprehension on the Opposition's part explains their large attendance; they do not usually turn up for this sort of event and they will have been disappointed. They cannot be allowed to go on with such a discussion. [Hon. Members: "Sit down."] I shall sit down when I am ready and not when you tell me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have allowed the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Chisholm) some latitude in the hope that he would return to the matter in question. I am sure that he will heed that advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Winterton. May we have some clarification? I heard the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson) threaten you. I take it that he did not mean to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can say that I have a certain amount of deafness. I genuinely did not hear what the hon. Gentleman said. I am sure that whatever he may have said will not be repeated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was coming in due course to the second meaning of the word trust. I realise that two meanings are at issue this morning. Much concern has been expressed in my constituency about how this matter relates to the Leith hospital. People in Leith have a great affection for that hospital. Many people who have lived in Leith for a long time have experience of the endowment trusts that have been built up over the years. In the debate about the future of Leith hospital questions have been asked about what will happen to those trusts. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> That is why I can assure the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South that I am also interested in trusts in that sense. Will the Minister clarify that he meant that the trusts have not been earmarked for a particular hospital over the past 20 years or more? Certainly the widespread assumption in Leith is that those endowment trusts are still attached to Leith hospital. There is much concern, therefore, about what will happen to the endowment trusts when, according to the plans of Lothian health board, Leith hospital becomes a privately run operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will the formula be arrived at whereby money is distributed between the trusts, in the second sense, and health boards? I suppose the Minister will think that that matter is not relevant and that it will only be a short-term problem because once the whole of Scotland is covered with trusts presumably all the money will go straight to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the people who donated the money would be sad if they realised what it was being put forward at the moment. I am sure that many of those people thought that they were contributing money to a health service that would be run on the basis of health needs, rather than one run as a market. I shall not stray too far into that subject,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
in case the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South gets excited again. I shall leave it at that so that the Minister can answer my question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.42 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Forman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carshalton and Wallington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is my maiden experience on a Committee dealing with a Scottish statutory instrument—although many expatriate Scots live in Carshalton and most of them are sensible enough to vote Conservative. I would like to ask my hon. Friend the Minister a question concerning something that he said towards the end of his speech. He said that he commended the provision to the Committee at least in part on the grounds that there had been full consultation. He implied that everyone who had been consulted had approved of the provision. Could he tell us more about whom he consulted and why those people gave their approval?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.44 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the more general point raised by the hon. Member for Leith perhaps I can assure him that I understand that there is to be a general debate on the health service in Scotland, after the appropriate agreement between the usual channels, in the Scottish Grand Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to hear that the Government intend to speak to the Opposition through usual channels to arrange a debate on the NHS in Scotland in the Scottish Grand Committee. However, given that they are also about to announce a souped-up version of the Scottish Grand Committee which will do all kinds of wonderful things and will satisfy the demand for self-government in Scotland, will the Minister assure us that we shall be allowed to vote at the end of that sitting of the Scottish Grand Committee so that we can vote down whatever the Government propose in relation to the Scottish health service?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure, Mrs. Winterton, that you would not want me to do as the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) suggests. Besides, these days I am not sure whether he is included in the usual channels.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rather thought that that was the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the serious questions asked by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) and other hon. Members. The hon. Lady is right to say that many of the endowment trusts that we are discussing are very old indeed—they go back to Victorian times. To answer the hon. Lady's question about capital and income, the trust's capital is £24.2 million and the income distributed in 1991–92 was £1.6 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister confirmed that many bequests date from Victorian times. I am sure that I am right that many, if not all, the bequests would have come from well-meaning people with money to spare who want to help the poor to receive hospital treatment. The last thing that they would have wanted would have been for their money to help hospitals whose patients could already
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0682">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
afford treatment. Can the Minister guarantee that none of the money will be given to private-sector care within the hospitals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I can give the hon. Lady that guarantee. We are not changing the purposes for which the money is dispersed but the formula to update the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked who would decide about the allocation of funds between an NHS trust and a health board if there was a dispute in a given area. She is correct to assume that it would be the Secretary of State. She asked if the decision would be the result of an analysis by a civil servant. Undoubtedly that would be the case, although I wholly reject her suggestion that the Secretary of State ever agrees to an issue without examining it in great detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about sheep farming in Inverness?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the responsibility of my Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady's next question was about the research trust. She was right to raise that issue. The research trust is a separate trust, dealt with under separate regulations, and no change is envisaged. The hon. Member for Leith asked specifically about Leith hospital. I can categorically assure him that that hospital would continue to receive its share of any original endowments fund, even if it were to become a trust. The taking into account of the purposes of the original endowment trusts, in so far as that can be established after such a long time, is a central part of the new formula.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Forman), whose contribution I welcomed, asked who had been consulted. We have consulted the administrators of the trusts and the health boards and they are content with the proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.48 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was grateful for the Minister's answers because they have summoned other questions to my mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about an important sector of the health service—£24.2 million in capital is a significant amount. As the Minister said, £1.6 million was distributed in 1991–92. That is a lot of money which can do much good to help those in need. We must be clear about where the money will be spent. The Minister said that many of the endowment trusts date from Victorian times. Can he give us a breakdown of the proportion which predates the national health service, which came into being in 1948, and that which has been made since 1948, because people who made endowments after 1948 made them on behalf of a national health service, which was wholly in the public sector and under the control of health boards which were controlled by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not the same as the Government's proposals for Scotland because NHS trusts are not wholly in the national health service. They take on contracts from the NHS through the health boards and will treat NHS patients. But they also have private sector contracts with
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
people who pay for private medicine through insurance companies or some other means. Therefore, some of the money that was earmarked for the NHS may be given to an NHS trust, which treats some private sector patients and, perhaps, even gives them preferential treatment because they are prepared to pay more. I would have thought that anyone who made an endowment and intended it to be spent for the benefit of NHS patients would want to know that the money was still being used for that purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Kynoch 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am certainly not the hon. Gentleman's friend, but I shall give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A Freudian slip there. It is obviously the effect of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman and Opposition Members share a total misconception about the NHS and trust status hospitals. We must make clear, once and for all, that trust status hospitals are 100 per cent. within the NHS. That is a fact and I do not want to repeat it time and time again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman displays his ignorance. If he does not know that NHS trust hospitals can enter into contracts with anyone—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should sit and listen for a moment. In fact, the NHS trust hospitals can enter contracts with private sector insurance companies, individuals, companies, IBM, ICI and anyone who asks them to take on a contract to treat his employees. The hon. Gentleman may argue that NHS hospitals are free to do that, but there is a difference because NHS hospitals are completely controlled by the health boards and, through them, by the Government. No one controls the private sector work undertaken by NHS trusts. That is a matter for NHS trusts and for their boards. The Government should have no involvement with the private sector work carried out by trusts.

The hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside had better not call me his hon. Friend again. I know that he thinks that I am as much in opposition to the Labour party as he is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for Leith raised the subject of the NHS and trust status hospitals in the context of the endowments being given to NHS patients. NHS trusts clearly treat patients totally within the heath service. If they wish also to contract with the private sector, so what?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asks, "So what?" If money that was earmarked for the NHS is given to a trust, how will the Minister prevent it from deciding to use some of that money to treat private patients? He
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0683">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
cannot interfere with the work undertaken by an NHS trust for a private contractor. How will the Minister monitor how NHS trusts spend endowment money given to them in accordance with the terms of the statutory instrument? Members of the Committee need to know that before they approve the order. Otherwise, money that was earmarked as a charitable donation to the NHS will be misused by NHS trusts to treat private patients. We want an absolute guarantee that that will not happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It may help the Commitee if the hon. Gentleman does not digress too far in his remarks and returns to the substance of the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the substance of the scheme was the endowments that are being given to health boards and NHS trusts. I am trying to deal with what happens to the endowments once they are given to NHS trusts. The Minister said that he would guarantee that the original purposes for which the endowments were made would not be changed. What guarantee can he give? He told my hon. Friend the Member for Leith that the money would be divided between the health boards. If the money were going to the health boards no one would complain. But it is not, it is going to the trusts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman has made that point more than once, and I should be grateful if he would direct his remarks to the statutory instrument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to do exactly that. The Minister said that the money that had been allocated by endowments would be given to health boards and trusts. He said that, if a dispute arose about how the money was to be distributed, a civil servant would decide the matter. Will the hon. Gentleman tell us who the civil servant will be and whether that civil servant will be acting under the direction of Ministers or will be independent? In other words, will the civil servant decide between the health board and the trust or will the Minister? If it is to be the Minister, how will he monitor the money that goes to the trust to ensure that it will be spent on NHS patients, and not misused?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that full consultation on the proposals had been carried out. I accept that administrators of the trust must be consulted, as do the health boards, albeit that they are simply the creatures of the Minister. For the past 13 to 14 years, the Government have been packing health boards with their lackeys. What about the elected representatives of the people of Scotland? When were we consulted about the statutory instrument? We were not. The first that we saw of it was when it was available in the Table Office. That is a shoddy way in which to treat the national health service in Scotland and the Scottish people. If they knew what was going on in the Committee, they would realise quickly that the only answer would be to have a Scottish Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.56 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his partial reply about the funds. I should like more clarification. Was he implying that account would be taken of the original purpose for which the money was given? For example, if 10 per cent. of the endowment funds from the past had been earmarked for Leith hospital, would there still be an
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
attempt to direct that 10 per cent. to the same hospital, or will all the money go into one pot, with no account being taken of the original hospital for which the money was earmarked? That question applies to other hospitals for which endowment funds had been given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister described such hospitals as becoming trusts. He obviously knows more than I do, but the immediate plan for Leith hospital is that it will be transformed into a private nursing home on the same basis as those private nursing homes such as Westminster plc that have sprung up in Glasgow. When I read about that last weekend in 	<i>Scotland on Sunday,</i> I thought that that was an apt name. As the article described, such an arrangement will result in declining standards of care because staff are employed on the cheap. I worry that that will happen in Leith.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will some of the endowment money be earmarked for Leith hospital? If it is, I share the same worries as my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East. Our basic argument is that all the money should be directed to boards. We cannot rely on private nursing homes or trusts to use the money for the purposes for which it was originally intended. My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East referred to private patients in trust hospitals. I wish to refer to another salient feature of trust hospitals, which is the enormous sums that are being spent on the management of those hospitals. I have been informed that the salaries of senior management—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not a matter for the Committee. I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would bring his remarks to order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall conclude by saying that we are worried about how the money will be spent. We want it to be used for the original purpose for which it was endowed, which was, in most cases, to help poor people who could not afford treatment in the health service. We do not have faith that trusts will use it for the purpose for which it was originally intended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.59 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Calum Macdonald: 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Western Isles)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned disputes between health boards and NHS trusts over how the money should be divided. Such a dispute would be especially acute when a hospital had opted out in opposition not just to the local community, which is always the case, but to the local health board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may be aware that the management of the Western Isles hospital has shown interest in applying for NHS trust status, but that the health board has stated its opposition to such a move. I do not know of any other such case in Scotland where the health board has said that it is unhappy with the prospect of the management seeking trust status. If the Scottish Office allowed such an application to go ahead and a trust to be formed in opposition to the wishes of the health board, there would be the potential for the kind of dispute over money that the Minister described. One way of preventing that would be for the Minister to make it clear today that he would not permit any management to go ahead with an application if the local health board was clearly opposed. If he could give that commitment, it would help the Committee a great deal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Kennedy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ross, Cromarty and Skye)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have one factual question for the Minister, as we listen to his intriguing tale unravel. We have spoken, for obvious reasons, about hospitals but, as the hon. Member for Leith said, there could be knock-on effects, for example, on the private nursing sector. Elsewhere in Britain trusts have involved not only the hospital sector. In Northumberland, for example, ambulance services have formed an NHS trust. One or two trusts in Scotland might follow suit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If various sectors of the health service in Scotland did that, would those NHS trusts, as defined in the order, be eligible for access to the funds, or is it restricted to the hospital sector to which the money was awarded? If the Minister cannot answer me today, he can write to me later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.2 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that the answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is no, but I shall investigate the matter further and confirm that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East was in his usual ebullient form. At one point I thought that he was about to suggest that we should hold a multi-option referendum on the scheme. I can reassure him on his key question, which was how much of the money under discussion was given after the establishment of the national health service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that information. Will he confirm that all that money was owned by the national health service after 1948?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course the capital was invested by the trust and the income went to the national health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general point that the hon. Member for Dundee, East made was also raised by the hon. Member for Leith, who asked me what would happen if Leith hospital went into the private sector. I can give him an assurance that under such circumstances the hospital would no longer be eligible to receive any of that income.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some time ago, we heard about a hospital in Bristol that was so desperate to acquire funds to keep itself going that it began to provide veterinary services for local pet animals. If a Scottish Hospital did that in order to acquire sufficient income, can the Minister assure us that such work would not be eligible for any of the endowment fund that went to that hospital? How could that be ensured?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I can do that. There is a duty on the boards, and, indeed, on future trusts, to spend the funds on services that they provide, and to bear in mind any stipulation of the original donor. I hope that, having given that assurance, I may commend the scheme to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not want to prolong the debate unreasonably. We have had a useful discussion this morning that has clarified a couple of points. Although Conservative members of the Committee seem to believe
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
that there is no reason to worry, we remain convinced that there is a danger that money could be put to a use that was not intended by those who made the endowments in their wills. Assurances are not worth a lot when they are not written into the statutory instrument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister just said that NHS trusts will be instructed to spend the money that they receive on services that they provide, and to bear in mind any stipulation of the original donor. Given that all the original donors made their donations before the creation of the national health service, there will be no stipulation that they must be spent on national health service patients. It would be perfectly legitimate, under the terms of the Minister's assurance, for money that goes to NHS trusts to be spent on private patients, because that is a service that they provide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes clear the point that concerns all Labour members of the Committee. It is the clear intention of those who made the bequests that they be used to help those who need them. Hospitals under trust status will embark on an increasing amount of work that is paid for by a person's income or insurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian H. Donohoe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cunninghame, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I suggest a way of overcoming that problem? Instead of extending the trust beyond the existing 15 boards as the scheme provides, the moneys should be retained and distributed to the boards for forwarding to whomever they please. I cannot for the life of me understand why that has not been accepted, considering the role that the health boards are supposed to continue to play in the health service in Scotland. That would protect all the moneys and would be more sensible. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill will agree that that would be a better course of action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly agree with my hon. Friend. That would be a simple and straightforward course of action. It would make it more likely that the public in each health board area would be aware of plans for the distribution of endowments and make their views known. If they are distributed in the way planned by the Government, no one will have the slightest idea what their money is being used for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point, it is essential that the money goes to health boards. With the purchaser-provider split in England, the problem that is developing is that the purchasers, the health boards, have run out of money. The system is breaking down and no treatment is possible, except for emergencies. Surely the health boards, as purchasers, need the money. A lot of the money would, if given to health boards, eventually, through contracts, go to trusts anyway. That should satisfy Conservative members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Trying to persuade Conservative members of the Committee of the reasonableness of our arguments is like talking to a wall. Those who created the endowments, and those who have succeeded to their control, thought it was absolutely certain that the money would be used as they intended. There will be no such certainty if hospital trusts are given the money. As my hon. Friends have said, they are likely,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0685">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
if they run out of money, to repeat the experiences south of the border.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conditions are appalling in the health service south of the border. Hospitals that run out of money given by the local health authority are scrabbling for income from anywhere else and will buy in services for anyone who is willing to pay. Therefore, some of the money which came to a hospital as an endowment might be used for unsuitable purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington made a very good point and if he continues to make such points to Ministers his future will not be happy. As usual, the consultation has been extremely narrow in range, but even when the Government engage in full-scale consultation they pay no attention as we all know. That occured with health, water privatisation, our wishes for a Scottish Parliament and numerous other issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that Opposition Members cannot support the scheme before us because of the Minister's abject failure to tell us how it would be monitored. As always, Conservative Members merely dispose of things and once they have disposed of a trust hospital or anything else to the private sector they "don't give a monkey's".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those endowment funds will be drained very quickly. The Minister failed to tell us how often the scheme will be monitored to ensure that those funds are not wasted. We are talking about real Tories who work, not the gang of cut-price merchants on the other side of the Committee who are not concerned about how the endowment funds will be disbursed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his comment and I will give way to the Minister if he wants to give my hon. Friend the assurances that he seeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will wait until the hon. Lady has finished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fife</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unless the Minister can give us the assurances that we seek, I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee., West that we must oppose the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have spent 43 minutes discussing what we all agree is a relatively minor aspect of the running of the health service in Scotland. On the day that Parliament broke for the Christmas recess in mid-December, we did not receive an offer from a Minister of one minute to discuss hospitals going into trust status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South is amused because I spoke about privatisation, but we are worried about the future of our hospitals because they will take on increasing amounts of private work to fund themselves. We are drifting further away from the principals on which the national health service was built and the people of Scotland recognise that reality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Victorian values and Victorian sideburns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend refers to Victorian values, but some Victorians wanted to help people in need. The Government are taking away from the poorest among us, so they have a lot to learn from their Victorian predecessors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister follows either of two ways, we will not oppose the scheme. He can say that he will change his mind, withdraw the scheme and disburse the money to health boards, or he can redraft the statutory instrument to make clear the exact controls that will be applied to ensure that the money goes where it was originally intended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.13 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me corrent the hon. Member for Dundee, West. My sideburns are Edwardian, not Victorian.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I can reassure the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe). Opposition Members made two points: how can we be sure that endowment income will not be misused, and that it is spent within the national health service?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the first point, once appointed, trustees must keep and publish proper accounts of capital income received and expenditure incurred. The funds must be audited independently to ensure that they are spent legitimately. In addition, I would expect the trust's own audit committee of non-executive directors to keep the situation under close scrutiny, as they do at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members also asked for guarantees that the income from the endowments will be spent exclusively on the provision of NHS services. Cast iron guarantees can be given because in paragraph 3(1) the reference to paragraph 7 of schedule 6 to the 1978 Act makes it clear that the income must be spent on direct services provided by the NHS.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
