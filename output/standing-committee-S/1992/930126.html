Draft Motor Vehicles (Wearing of Seat Belts) Regulations 1993</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Roads and Traffic (Mr. Kenneth Carlisle)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the committee has considered the draft Motor Vehicles (Wearing of Seat Belts) Regulations 1993.</p></blockquote>
I am glad to be able to speak today in support of these new seat belt wearing regulations. They replace three existing statutory instruments, and it might help the Committee if I gave the background to the measures.<br><br>
It is now 10 years—almost to the day—since the first seat belt wearing regulations came into force, on 31 January 1983. They made it compulsory to wear seat belts in the front of those vehicles that were required to have them fitted. At that time, that meant, essentially, cars registered in 1965 or later and light vans registered in 1967 or later.<br><br>
Much has happened in the intervening decade. Perhaps most importantly, the public have accepted to a large degree the safety value of wearing seat belts and of using child restraints, especially in the front seats of cars. Recent surveys show that nearly 95 per cent. of front seat drivers and passengers comply with the requirement, which is one of the highest wearing rates in the world. Unfortunately, the rear seat belt wearing rates are nothing like so good; in post-1987 cars, which are required to have rear seat belts fitted, nearly 85 per cent. of children wear them but only about 60 per cent. of adults.<br><br>
I hope that the seat belt wearing campaign, which I shall launch next week, will help to persuade the public just how important it is to wear seat belts in the rear, for their own sake and that of the front seat occupants, It is estimated that if all rear seat passengers wore belts there would be a saving to them of almost 100 deaths and 1,000 serious injuries per year, in addition to the savings achieved with the resent rate of wearing. There would also be a considerable reduction in injuries to front seat occupants caused by rear seat passengers being thrown forward—often with alarming force.<br><br>
It is sometimes difficult to recall how controversial it was to introduce seat belts. Between 1973 and 1981, there were eight attempts to do so. Even back in 1981, when the law was first introduced, Parliament took a different view of the wearing of seat belts by children. It is important to realise that the legislation is constructed differently in relation to children, making it an offence to carry a child in the front seat without a seat belt or restraining device, except where prescribed by regulations. Those regulations were, and still are, subject only to negative resolution.<br><br>
The next development came in 1989 when, following a successful private Member's Bill promoted by my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Cheadle (Mr. Day), regulations were introduced to require children to wear seat
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
belts in the rear of cars where they were fitted. Then, in 1991, came the regulations on the wearing of seat belts by adults in rear seats.<br><br>
Meanwhile, the European Commission was preparing Community legislation on the compulsory wearing of seat belts, which was finally adopted at the end of 1991. As is often the way with Community legislation, we were already complying with nearly all the requirements but needed to amend our legislation to comply with the very small amount with which we were not complying.
We started from a position in which four different sets of regulations were introduced over 10 years under two different provisions in primary legislation. Some of the regulations were subject to the affirmative procedure, and others were negative resolution instruments. They applied to categories of vehicle defined in obscure, but slightly differing, ways and contained a veritable maze of implied exemptions. It was a brave policeman who would bring a charge for failing to wear a seat belt. Even more worrying, despite our best endeavours, it was difficult for people affected by the law to know what it required of them.<br><br>
On top of that came the recent European Community directive. It was not substantially different from our regulations but it contained a different definition of a child. Our primary legislation on child seat belt wearing applies to children less than 14 years old, but the Council directive applies to children up to 12 years old and 4ft 11ins tall. It would appear that our Community partners' children mature earlier and can literally grow out of their childhood.<br><br>
Furthermore, the EC directive and our own primary legislation do not make the same distinction between front and rear seats. It has, therefore, been necessary to make regulations under the European Communities Act 1972 to amend the Road Traffic Act 1988, to implement the Council directive. To have gone on to implement the remaining provisions of the directive by amending the existing regulations would have been like building an extension to a ramshackle 16th-century house.<br><br>
Because the law affects so many people, we decided to undertake full-scale consultation in an attempt to rationalise and simplify the complicated seat belt law. More than 400 representative bodies were consulted and we received 105 responses. The result is that we were able to reduce the four sets of regulations to two. I would have much preferred all seat belt regulations to be contained in a single set, but that was not possible because the regulations governing the wearing of seat belts by children travelling in front seats are subject to the negative resolution procedure. It is the main set of regulations, subject to affirmative resolution, that is before us today. They govern the wearing of seat belts by adults travelling in front and rear seats and by children in rear seats.<br><br>
Having promised rationalisation and simplification, I should dearly like to be able to hold up just two pages of regulations, but that could have been achieved only by primary legislation. That was not possible, so we are still left with a challenging set of provisions.<br><br>
We have gone some way towards simplifying the law for the general public. Of course, exemptions and complications remain at the margin, but for almost all vehicle occupants the new laws can be simply and clearly stated. When travelling in the front seat of any vehicle, an adult must wear a seat belt if one is available; when travelling in the rear of a car, an adult must wear a seat belt if one is available; no child may be carried unrestrained in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0495">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
the front seat of any vehicle; no child may be carried unrestrained in the rear seat of a car if there is an appropriate restraint available anywhere in the car.<br><br>
An "appropriate restraint" means a purpose-built infant carrier or a child seat for a child less than three years old and, for a child of three years or more, a purpose-built child seat if one is available or, otherwise, an adult seat belt.<br><br>
I hope that the Committee will agree that those are common-sense rules, which have the significant merit of saying what a lot of people already believed. Although the regulations may give rise to many technical questions, which I shall do my best to answer, it would be more helpful to the Committee if I explained the underlying rationale rather than sought to describe the regulations one at a time.<br><br>
I will, however, detain the Committee a moment longer on exemptions. They are almost unchanged from the existing regulations, the principal exemption being for medical conditions. The most significant change is contained in regulation 6(1)(f), which is wider than the existing exemptions for fire brigades and the police and includes prisoners under escort as well as the persons escorting them.<br><br>
The limited nature of the previous exemption caused operational difficulties for the police and I am sure that it was right to broaden it. However, the Committee will doubtless agree that it is important that the police set an example in such matters, and I am pleased to be able to convey to the Committee the assurance that I have been given that police officers will direct their personnel to use seat belts at all times, except when that would cause them operational difficulties.<br><br>
To sum up, we are considering a set of regulations which replaces three previous sets. A second, closely related set of regulations that is currently before the House deals with the wearing of seat belts by children in front seats. Those two sets of regulations implement the Council directive on seat belt wearing and simplify, so far as is possible, the application of the law. Finally, there are also regulations before the House, made under the European Communities Act 1972, which make a small change to the primary legislation to complete implementation of the Council directive.<br><br>
All the instruments are intended to come into force on 2 February, when I shall be launching a major publicity campaign to inform the public of the law and to persuade them of the merits of wearing seat belts. Among the campaign material will be a leaflet explaining the new law in, I am glad to say, simple terms.<br><br>
While it is right that the Committee should be concerned with the details of the legislation, we should not lose sight of its purpose. Without doubt, the requirement to wear seat belts has been the single most important road safety measure that has ever been introduced. It is difficult to appreciate that the regulations have the proven potential to save some 300 lives each year.<br><br>
Today, we are making only relatively minor adjustments to those laws and I cannot claim that they will vastly reduce the number or severity of road casualties. However, I am confident that by simplifying the law and making it more easily understood, we can further increase the wearing of seat belts and so take a further step towards meeting our casualty reduction target. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
<p>10.41 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Joan Walley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Any measure that improves road safety—particularly children's safety, to which some of the regulations relate—has the full support of Opposition Members. There are 400 casualties annually among children aged nought to 15 years who travel in the front seats of cars, which is far too many. If that figure can be reduced by a factor of three, that must be done. For that reason, we are pleased to support the proposals.<br><br>
Of the 100 responses to the consultation paper, only one was an objection in principle to the proposed regulations. That shows the widespread support for the regulations, particularly among specialist lobbies such as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents and the Child Accident Prevention Trust, and many other organisations concerned with road safety all year round. We should be aware of their support for the measure and support their stance—which is that everything possible must be done to improve road safety and that seat belts play a part in that.<br><br>
One of the main issues to be considered is how to obtain full enforcement both of regulations already agreed and those that the Committee will agree today. Many of my hon. Friends and I are aware that available police time is being substantially reduced. What account has the Minister taken of the need to enforce the regulations? New regulations will be no use if they cannot be properly enforced.<br><br>
We do not want to detract from the message—which must be stressed—that the wearing of seat belts is paramount. It is almost 10 years since the compulsory wearing of seat belts was introduced. It is high time that there was a compaign to improve the take-up of seat belt wearing under the existing regulations and under those that we shall agree today. Just because there will be slightly tighter regulations applicable to children sitting in the front and rear of cars and tighter regulations applicable to adults sitting in the rear of cars, it cannot be assumed that a comprehensive set of regulations and a framework for dealing with the safety of passengers in vehicles exist.<br><br>
The Minister should say how he proposes that the public will be informed of the requirement that they must wear seat belts, how seat belts should be fitted and how restraints should be used. Is not it the case that road safety issues cannot be dealt with by a tight remit of regulations alone? There must be even tighter regulations.<br><br>
I am particularly concerned about rear lap belts. A parliamentary question on the subject was put to the then Minister for Roads and Traffic, Mr. Chope, last year. He was asked:
<br><blockquote><p>"what research his Department is carrying out into the potential dangers of the wearing of single strap seat belts … what statistical information he has on injuries associated with the wearing of single strap seat belts."</p></blockquote>
He replied:
<br><blockquote><p>"Statistics on injuries caused by the wearing of lap belts in the United Kingdom are not available, but research in the United States indicates that lap belts reduce death and serious injury by 25 to 40 per cent. and three point belts by 40 to 50 per cent. Although there is no current research specifically into this topic, the Department is monitoring the effectiveness of all seat belts, in its accident crash investigations."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 5 February 1992; Vol. 203, c. <i>168.</i>]</p></blockquote>
Is it still the case that no research has been undertaken into the wearing of rear lap belts? If not, why not? While we will always maintain that wearing such a belt is better than
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0496">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
wearing no seat belt, why is vehicle design not incorporated into the regulations, so that they are comprehensive and cover the relative merits of rear lap belts and rear diagonal belts? Many accident prevention organisations want the Government to take those issues on board, as do we.<br><br>
Why are we not discussing regulations that deal with passenger restraints in not only cars but buses, minibuses and taxis? ROSPA is concerned about that aspect. I did not hear the Minister mention road safety education, and I shall return to that subject. I am delighted that there will be a major public awareness campaign, starting on 2nd February, to persuade the public of the merits of taking account of the regulations. Has the Minister considered from where the resources will come to get that campaign off the ground?<br><br>
I wish that the regulations also covered accident prevention within a policy of care and prevention in the national health service. We shall have a debate later today in the Chamber about the crisis in the national health service. We heard this morning about the great number of accidents that occur and how seat belts can help to prevent them, but what account does national health service preventive work—in GP clinics, in hospitals and in antenatal care for pregnant women—take of the wearing of seat belts and the proper fitting and use of child restraints?<br><br>
I want the Minister to deal with the question of tighter regulations. Does he accept that there is anxiety about the use of lap belts in the rear seats of cars? The many regulations make a dog's dinner. We are dealing with a major contribution to the prevention of injury that saves many lives, yet it is not deemed worthy of primary legislation that would tidy up all the different regulations.<br><br>
To what extent did the Minister and his colleagues take up this matter when we had the presidency of the European Council of Transport Ministers? The Minister referred to European regulations and said that our actions would bring us into line with them. The proposals have been slow in coming forward. What more must we do to bring us into line with tighter European standards?<br><br>
I want to press the Minister on the subject of technology, which should be standardised. What discussions are taking place? I am full of praise for the booklet "Every Ride A Safe Ride", produced by the Child Accident Prevention Trust in conjunction with Volvo, which is the only motor manufacturer that automatically installs lap and diagonal rear seat belts. Is the Department of Transport undertaking similar research; if so, is it widely available?<br><br>
This is a timely opportunity to ask why the regulations do not refer to seat belts in all vehicles—including non-fare stage buses, minibuses and coaches. When can we expect such regulations?<br><br>
I mentioned enforcement and the education awareness programme, and refer now to road safety education and road safety officers employed by local authorities. I understand that local authorities have a statutory duty—I emphasise that it is a statutory duty—under the Road Traffic Acts 1974 and 1988. Section 39 of the 1988 Act states that each local authority must carry out studies into accidents on the road and
<br><blockquote><p>"must, in the light of those studies, take such measures as appear to the authority to be appropriate to prevent such accidents, including the dissemination of information and advice relating to the use of roads, the giving of practical training to road users or any class or description of road users."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
Does that duty extend to the regulations? Are road safety officers, who are highly skilled professionals employed in local authorities throughout the country, expected to assist in the public awareness campaign to highlight the proposals that will start on 2 February?<br><br>
Has the Minister discussed that aspect with the Department of the Environment? Through the cuts in the standard spending assessment programme, that Department has reduced the ability of local councils to perform their statutory duties.<br><br>
I make no bones about my anxiety on receiving from the Association of London Borough Road Safety Officers a copy of a letter showing that the London Borough of Enfield has issued redundancy notices to its road safety staff, effective on 31 March. Does that mean that, because of local authority cuts, the post of road safety officer is being phased out? Where does that leave councils in respect of their statutory duties?<br><br>
The regulations introduce provisions and amend Road Traffic Acts. I am sure that single-handed, the Minister can do a tremendous amount to stress the importance of wearing seat belts. However, surely the success of the road safety campaign will depend on the ability of road safety officers, not just in Enfield—where, if the redundancy notices come into effect on 31 March, those posts will soon no longer exist—but throughout the length and breadth of the country. How will they be informed and given sufficient resources to ensure that there is full enforcement and comprehensive public education regarding the regulations?<br><br>
We want the most comprehensive regulations possible, which we do not have yet. There is a long way to go. The Minister must tell us how the regulations will be introduced properly.</span></p>
<p>10.56 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Carlisle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for her general support for the regulations. There is a commitment in Parliament, above the battle of the parties, to road safety, which is important in carrying the public with us and in dealing sensibly with the issue. I shall try to answer the hon. Lady's points, but some were quite technical. If I cannot cover them all, I shall write to her about the others.<br><br>
The hon. Lady asked how the regulations would be enforced. It is important that they are kept simple, make common sense and are readily understood. The police fully support the regulations. They will take part in our campaign and some forces will conduct local campaigns. Through various reforms, there are now considerably more police officers on the beat and it will be recognised that the regulations must be enforced.<br><br>
We must accept that enforcement is not sufficient—it is a matter also of persuasion and of educating the public. That is why we put such great emphasis in our advertising campaign on persuading the public to wear seat belts. The arguments for that are compelling. When we launch our campaign on 2 February, the hon. Lady will see that our television commercial is powerful and persuasive. There are plenty of funds within the budget to make proper provision for such publicity. Persuasion through our clear leaflet is the best way forward.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Walley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Minister's remarks, does he envisage that local authorities will have the resources to implement that nationally directed campaign locally?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0497">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carlisle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady raises another point. It is a national and local campaign, as was the campaign against drink driving. Our national campaign received wide coverage and local safety officers undertook their own campaigns.<br><br>
The hon. Lady said that many councils did not pay enough attention to safety. Of course, that depends on how effectively the local authority is run. Some are run badly and because of their inefficiency they must make cuts in areas in which they should not. It is not for me to say which party runs most of those authorities. However, my local authority in Lincolnshire places great emphasis on road safety and undertakes its own safety campaigns that link with those of my Department. In addition the hon. Lady knows, we increased the budget of the grant for safety schemes run by local authorities from £43 million this year to £50 million next year. That will enable a range of safety schemes to be put in place.<br><br>
The hon. Lady asked a few technical questions. She referred to lap belts in the centre of rear seats. We have established a base of facts on how accident injuries are caused, which has helped to build up a picture of the effect of wearing seat belts. However, the amount of information available is not adequate to draw any clear conclusions. Common sense can bring its force to bear on that. Obviously, it is safer to wear lap belts in the rear of a car than it is not to do so, thus risking being thrown through the windscreen—<i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The background hum of conversation betwen certain hon. Members is distracting to those who want to listen to the Minister. I shall be grateful if it will cease.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carlisle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, seat belts that are worn properly are the best approach to safety.<br><br>
The problem is technical. It is difficult to install three-point seat belts in all cars. They can be installed in some, and Volvo now makes a proper fitment. It is a great selling point for a car if it is safe. With the increasing use of air bags, we shall see more cars being sold on their safety merits, which is a good thing. In fact, such a commercial approach may go faster than we can move within the European single market.<br><br>
We want to see the use of three-point seat belts, but meanwhile, lap belts are currently the best for technical reasons.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Walley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister give some idea of when he will issue proposals to examine the use of three-point diagonal seat belts rather than rear lap belts?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carlisle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is part of the single market question. We are in continual discussions with our partners in Europe about the possibilities of making further progress.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
The costs involved would raise the price of a car, and many other considerations need to be taken into account. In general, we are more vigorous in pressing Europe to make progress than most other countries.<br><br>
As to the hon. Lady's point about buses and the compulsory wearing of seat belts on coaches, she will know that, as yet, there is no requirement for rear seat belts to be fitted in all buses. Under the terms of the relevant Common Market directive, no manufacturer is obliged to fit seat belts or anchorages other than to front seats and to all exposed forward-facing seats. We have been leaders in pressing the EC Commission to introduce proposals as soon as possible, which would require seat belts to be fitted on all seats on coaches and minibuses. However, because of the terms of the single market, we must work within the European context—even though we are one of the leaders in pressing for those proposals.<br><br>
We are anxious to see the introduction of more safely designed vehicles. We want to sell our cars in the European market so, again, we must work within the constraints of the single market.<br><br>
I hope that that answers most of the hon. Lady's questions. I shall read through her remarks and, if further replies are needed, write to her.<br><br>
This measure is just one example of the practical ways in which we seek to make our roads safer. We could go over the top and make regulations so restrictive that there would be a backlash from the public. However, we always have to be sensible and to take the public with us. That is why, with the wearing of seat belts, not only the law but persuasion are required.<br><br>
It is interesting to note how attitudes have changed. Since the introduction of seat belt wearing, the evidence is clear that a person who wears a seat belt is more likely to survive an accident than someone who does not. An example is the tragic case a few days ago when two cars, involving seven occupants, crashed. Six of the occupants were wearing seat belts and survived with only slight injuries. The occupant who was not wearing a seat belt went through the windscreen and was killed. That vivid example shows how sensible it is that we should try—in a measured, reasonable way—to persuade the British public that it is in their interests to wear seat belts. I very much welcome the regulations.</span></p>
