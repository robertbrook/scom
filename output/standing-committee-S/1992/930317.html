	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Alistair Burt)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Child Support (Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 1993.</p></blockquote>
I am conscious of the fact that I am inviting the Committee to agree to amend provisions which have not yet come into effect. I do so without apology. Hon. Members will recall that two packages of child support regulations were passed last year. I have been grateful for the constructive spirit of the debates which have taken place in the House, particularly the debate on 30 June 1992 when I presented four of the statutory instruments to the House. Time has moved on since then and, in doing the detailed work necessary to design systems and procedures by which the new scheme can be effectively delivered, we have identified a number of minor defects in the way in which the regulations were originally drafted which would have meant that what actually happened if the provisions were exactly followed would not have corresponded exactly with the policy intention. We also spotted several purely technical points of drafting on which improvements could be made. We believe it to be important that, in embarking on a new scheme, the foundation on which the Child Support Agency will implement the policy should be as well constructed as possible. That is why we are now taking the opportunity to correct the problems that we have identified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be less than honest if I did not tell the Committee that the regulations make one or two adjustments to the details of the policy intention. The adjustments are minor and they do not affect the thrust of the matters which hon. Members have already debated on a number of occasions; rather, they reflect the fact that the detailed design work to which I referred earlier has allowed us to consider further one or two specific matters and make what we believe to be improvements in the way in which they will be dealt with. With your permission, Dr. Blackburn, in going through this set of regulations in order to explain them to the Committee, I shall concentrate on those matters rather than on the regulations which make merely technical amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulations 2 to 18 amend the Child Support (Maintenance Assessment Procedure) Regulations 1992 which deal with the procedures to be followed in making an assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 2 allows my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State some discretion on whether to issue a maintenance inquiry form. It removes what would otherwise be a bureaucratic requirement to issue a maintenance inquiry form when a child support officer can clearly make a decision on the evidence available from the maintenance
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
application form alone. One example might be when it is absolutely clear that the absent parent is habitually resident abroad and outside jurisdiction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulations 3 and 45 cover interim maintenance assessments. There will be two types of interim maintenance assessment—category A and category B. Category A deals with the failure of an absent parent to provide information and is the existing interim maintenance assessment, which is set at 1.5 times the maintenance requirement. The second type, category B, is a new sort of interim maintenance assessment and is needed to cover the case where the partner of a parent, or a member of the family of the absent parent, fails to give information about his or her income, when it is required, for example, to decide whether the protected income provisions apply. It would not be right if, as a result of the partner's failure to provide information, a maintenance assessment could not be completed and a child was therefore deprived of maintenance. We also do not think it right that the existing interim maintenance assessment, which is set at 1.5 times the maintenance requirement, should apply to such cases, since that sort of interim maintenance assessment is specifically designed to act as an incentive to an uncooperative absent parent directly involved in the assessment. In those cases, therefore, a category B interim maintenance assessment will be used. That is essentially a normal maintenance assessment but with a level of income assumed for the parent's partner which cannot give any advantage to the parent concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulations 5, 7 to 11 and 16 all deal with aspects of the review and appeal system. Regulation 5 ensures that, when the child support officer refuses to make a wholly new assessment following a review under section 18 of the Child Support Act 1991, the child support officer will notify the person who applied for that review. The child support officer must also give details of the applicant's right of appeal under section 20 of the Act. Currently, parties to a section 18 or 19 review are not required to notify the child support officer of all recent changes in their circumstances. However, it is important that an assessment that captures all changes in the parties' circumstances is made annually and regulation 7 ensures that the annual review takes place when it would originally have done so, so that all the circumstances are reviewed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 8 is designed to improve efficiency as it avoids needless duplication of information gathering. The regulation states that the child support officer is not required to obtain information from the parties to an assessment on a section 17 review in certain cases in which sufficient information is already available. Fresh assessments following reviews under this section are usually subject to a de minimis trigger, the level of which, depending on the precise circumstances, is either £10 or £1. However, regulation 9 provides that when the absent parent is considered to have no assessable income or is required to pay only the minimum amount of maintenance, a child support officer will make a fresh assessment on completing a review under section 17 of the Act. That provision affords absent parents an important level of protection because it ensures that a previous assessment will not continue in force against them if they are on a low income because any change, however small, will have an effect on the maintenance assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
Regulation 10 deals with the possible situation if a child support officer refuses an application for a maintenance assessment on grounds of lack of jurisdiction and a court subsequently refuses to make a maintenance order on the same grounds. If that were to happen, it could mean that neither the agency nor the court was dealing with a maintenance application. This amendment ensures that when someone affected by that situation wishes to apply to the Child Support Agency for a review of the decision, the 28-day time limit for the appeal runs from the date of the final decision by the court and not from the date of the original decision by the child support officer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 11 introduces new regulation 26A. This is a technical provision which ensures that when a request for a review is made because there is a dispute about parentage, and there is another reason for the review as well, the review application will be treated as two separate applications. Paternity will be dealt with by the courts and the remaining issues will be dealt with under the normal CSA review and appeal provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 16 inserts new regulation 57 into the maintenance assessment procedure regulations. It deals with the situations that may arise when an application for a review of maintenance raises a question as to benefit entitlement. When that happens, this amendment allows my hon. Friend the Secretary of State to pass information to the relevant authorities so that the matter can be resolved. It would not, however, be right to delay the review application unduly and therefore there is a specified time period of 28 days after which the Secretary of State will pass information to the child support officer to carry out the review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are three amendments that deal with applications from children in Scotland. As hon. Members know, children in Scotland may apply for maintenance in their own right under section seven of the Child Support Act. Regulation six is simply a drafting amendment so that the regulation accurately reflects the wording of that Act and regulation 18 similarly corrects an error in the drafting of the original regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 12 introduces regulation 32A. If a child moves from Scotland and ceases to be habitually resident there, the provisions of section seven no longer apply. This regulation enables a child support officer to cancel an assessment in those cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulations 15, 24 and 25 provide for the child support legislation to be applied when children in local authority care are allowed to live with a parent under the provisions of the Children Act 1989. In general, children in local authority care are covered by the provisions of that Act which allow local authorities to seek contributions towards the maintenance of such children. Those provisions are not appropriate to children who are allowed to live with one of their parents and regulation 15 ensures that a parent in those circumstances has the same rights to claim maintenance as other parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 24 is a drafting amendment and regulation 25 introduces new regulation 27A into the Child Support Maintenance Assessments and Special Cases Regulations 1992. Those amendments will ensure that where a qualifying child is officially in the care of a local authority, but is allowed to live with a parent, the case is treated as a special one for the purposes of child support legislation, so the parent will be able to claim maintenance, thus putting her on an equal footing with other parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
I shall move on to regulations 19 to 34 of these amendment regulations which amend the Child Support (Maintenance Assessment and Special Cases) Regulations, and deal with the calculation of child support maintenance. Many of these amending regulations are of a minor, technical nature and do not entail any change in policy but merely ensure that the original policy intention is met. As before, I shall concentrate on those provisions that may be of particular in terest to hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 21 is concerned with allowances to be made in exempt income for children who do not live with the parent in question for seven nights a week. It ensures that the allowances are reduced only if the absent parent has the child for at least two nights a week on average, in which case the exempt income of the absent parent will also include allowances for the child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the formula produces a result less than the minimum amount of maintenance, which is set at 5 per cent. of the income support personal allowance for adults over 25, the absent parent must pay that minimum amount, unless exempt. From April 1993 that amount will be £2.20 a week. Regulation 23 provides that, when there are two or more persons with care looking after the children on the same absent parent, the minimum amount should be apportioned between the persons with care based on the relative sizes of the maintenance requirements. Where, because of rounding rules, that produces an aggregate figure that differs from the normal minimum amount, the regulation also provides that the aggregate figure should become the minimum amount payable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 26 deals with the deductions from an absent parent's income support. As hon. Members will know, when an absent parent receives income support, unless he comes within one of the exemption categories he will be required to make a contribution towards maintenance, and an amount equal to 5 per cent. of the personal allowance for adults over 25—£2.20 a week from April—will be deducted from his income support. The regulation makes small changes to the reasons for exempting an absent parent from making that contribution, in particular providing that the absent parent is exempt if he has day-today care of a child. It also deals with a case where an absent parent has a liability to support children by more than one person with care. In such cases, the amount deducted would be apportioned between the persons with care on the basis of the sizes of the maintenance requirements. If, because of rounding rules, that apportionment results in a different figure to that deducted, the Secretary of State will adjust the apportioned figures to ensure that the total equals the amount deducted and will do so in such a way as to be fair to all the persons with care. Finally, the regulation introduces a new schedule, schedule 5, which provides for a decision to make, or not to make, a deduction to be open to review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 27 ensures that the calculation of earnings for certain types of self-employed parents, such as childminders and share-fishermen, is consistent with that used in family credit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The remaining regulations, 35 to 46, make amendments to the Arrears, Interest and Adjustments of Maintenance Assessments Regulations, the Collection and Enforcement Regulations, the Collection and Enforcement of Other Forms of Maintenance Regulations and the Maintenance Arrangements and Jurisdiction Regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0342">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
Many of those amendents relate to matters of simple drafting in updating references. I shall briefly mention a few provisions which are of more interest. Regulation 36 amends regulation 4 of the Arrears, Interest and Adjustments of Maintenance Assessments Regulations and ensures that the original policy intention is made clear. We accept that some absent parents may not be able to make their maintenance payments on the correct date, and that amendment makes it clear that an absent parent who pays the outstanding sum within 28 days of the missed payment will not be charged interest. Regulation 37 ensures that relevant persons have written evidence of an arrears agreement reached between the parent and my right hon. Friend the Seceretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 46 amends the original provision, regulation 8 of the Maintenance Arrangements and Jurisdiction Regulations, which is defective. This amendment provides that where an absent parent made payments under an assessment in error because a court order should have remained in force, those payments will be treated as payments under the court order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have now spent some time going through these amendment regulations, which I hope that the Committee will agree are necessary to ensure the successful start of the new Child Support Agency in accordance with the clearest possible expression of our policy intentions. The silence of the Committee convinces me of the accuracy of and the need for the regulations. They are all perfectly clear and straightforward. I hope that I have made them clear to all members of the Committee; they have shown great patience in listening to my explanation. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Golding</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although the Labour Opposition support strongly the principle of the Child Support Act of forcing financial responsibility on to absent parents—many of whom are men—we are still very concerned that its implementation lacks generosity. If ever there were a situation where women and children should have been put first, this is it. The bulk of lone parents and their children suffer a meagre existence and the 1991 Act does nothing for them. Indeed, in some cases, it makes life even harder. For those on family credit, for example, there is a loss of automatic benefits. If maintenance is not paid, there is a serious problem. It is not only the abandoned family who suffers. The Child Poverty Action Group has consistently argued that second families on low incomes will be unduly penalised by the Child Support Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why has such a basically good initiative gone sour for so many? As with so much associated with the Government, the blame with the anonymous grey men in the Treasury. The three cheers that should have greeted this new approach faded quickly when it was realised that the women and children on income support—the bulk of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
abandoned—would get nothing. The Treasury scrooges saw to it that the bulk of any money from absent parents would go into the coffers of the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those men—they must have been men—decided that although a parent with care in receipt of family credit is allowed to keep the first £15 of maintenance before losing benefit, child support should be deducted pound for pound from income support. That leaves, in the words of the Child Poverty Action Group,
	<br><blockquote><p>"the vast majority of lone parents and their children on low benefit level incomes in or on the margins of poverty."</p></blockquote>
It men were, as so many put it in their old-fashioned way, to pay for their fun, the cash desk would be placed firmly in the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is hard to express the depth of resentment about the fact that so many families do not benefit from the maintenance paid and can in fact lose by it through the loss of other concessions such as school meals. Of course, the receipt of maintenance must be taken into account when assessing basic Social Security Benefits. But the scheme would have been better received and easier to implement if there had been some advantage to the mothers and children in it. We believe that there must be a strong case for those on income support receiving the same or similar concessions as those on family credit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Australians seem to be a very wise people. They recently elected a Labour Government for another term in office. My hon. Friends the Members for Croydon, Northwest (Mr. Wicks) and for York (Mr. Bayley) have often told me how the Australian Child Support Act was seen as an attack on child poverty with advantages for mothers and children, and not as a measure to reduce public spending. Compare that with our scheme which appears, to the worse off, to offer nothing but a lot of hassle. Harassment, pressure and anxiety are things that the lone parent and her children can well do without. For those worse off, there are no incentives in the 1991 Act. There is nothing that persuades either the lone parent or the absent parent to co-operate. For the poor, the 1991 Act, which contains advantages for the better off, is all stick and no carrot. The surge of support for the scheme gave way to justifiable resentment. People realised how the Government intended to use the element of compulsion. It was felt, rightly or wrongly, that we faced attitudes that would not have been out of place in the Victorian workhouse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two important areas of concern: the penalties imposed on already impoverished people are far too severe and too little sensitivity is shown for the fears of parents and caring mothers in particular. The Child Poverty Action Group believes that, although maintenance has some advantages as a source of income, it can also have some disadvantages. There are situations in which applying for maintenance may not be in the interests of parents with care of their children. Very great care should be taken before insisting that a parent with care apply for child maintenance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The CPAG's concern is shared by other responsible organisations, such as the National Council for One Parent Families and the Trades Union Congress, which give strong support to the general aim of the legislation. Incidentally, I am grateful to those organisations for the briefing that they have given, as I am to officials in the Department for ensuring that I had the published material to understand these complicated matters. They certainly are complicated. I do not underestimate the difficulties in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0343">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
introducing such a scheme. I think, however, that the problems would have been more effectively resolved if there had been more formal consultation with responsible outside bodies. The TUC has expressed a view to me of which the Minister should take careful note. It writes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the regulations for the Child Support Act are extremely complex, and very long. This is because they have to deal with the circumstances of millions of people. But Parliament should be wary of increasing the complexity of these regulations, as I believe several of these changes would. Is this process part of the 'Bonfire of Regulations' the Government have promised?"</p></blockquote>
It is not sufficient to have consulted by means of questionnaire in November 1991, the answers to which were not published. What is required is a continuous review. Certainly, it is a pity that the application of the requirement to co-operate policy guidelines were not subject to consultation. The advisory committee system has worked well in Social Security. Consideration should be given to the introduction of comparable advice in this field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the most part, the amendments are seen as a triumph of common sense over bureaucracy. The Minister's answer explained many of the things that were troubling me, but he did not answer all my concerns. I should be grateful if he would consider those matters now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, will the effect of the amendment to regulation 8 be to reduce the penalities when a partner refuses to give information? If so, it will be generally welcomed. It would, however, be helpful if the Minister would amplify the logic behind that measure. On that point, the memorandum from the Department of Social Security states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the partner fails to provide information on that income then it will be taken that he or she can afford to meet his or her share of the needs of the child, and only one half of the allowances and premiums paid in respect of that child will be included in exempt income."</p></blockquote>
Is the Minister saying that a new partner automatically assumes half responisbility for the maintenance of a child by a former marriage? Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will enlighten us on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, will the Minister clarify further the thinking behind the amendment to regulation 17? Who will benefit? Why go back to the original date? The Minister did explain it in part, but I am not sure whether I understand it correctly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, although we support the amendment to regulation 24, we cannot understand why, after having been passed from pillar to post, only 28 days are allowed for appeal. Why cannot more time be allowed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment most heavily highlighted for commendation by outside bodies has been that to regulation 42. The explanatory note states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"regulation 42 is amended to provide that a reduced benefit direction may be reviewed where relevant reasons are provided by a person other than a parent with care; and where a question arises as to whether the welfare of a child is likely to be affected by a reduced benefit direction continuing in force (regulation 14)".</p></blockquote>
I should like to explore that further to look very carefully into the mouth of that particular gift horse. Caring parents receiving either Income Support or Family Credit are required to claim maintenance through the Child Support Agency from the absent parent. Failure to do so without good cause makes them liable to a reduced benefit direction—in practice, a deduction of up to 20 per cent. of the adult personal allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From April 1993, parents with care who are in receipt of income support, family credit or disability working allowance will have to apply to the Child Support Agency
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
for child maintenance. If a parent refuses to do so, fails to show good cause why she should withhold details of the absent parent or fails to attend for interview, a letter is sent to her on behalf of the Secretary of State to tell her that she has not shown good reason for failing to co-operate. As a result, her benefit will be cut.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the parent does not complete the agency's maintenance application form, she will be given a six-week period in which to comply or to produce information explaining why she is unwilling to apply for maintenance. If the parent still refuses to authorise the agency to take action, a child support officer will consider whether there is good cause. A further two weeks' notice will be given that a "reduced benefit direction" may be applied if it is considered that she does not have good cause. Such a direction will reduce benefit by £8·80 a week for months and then by £4·40 a week for a further 12 months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current regulations provide that a parent with care has a right to ask for a reconsideration of the Secretary of State's decision but cannot appeal against it. A parent with care has a right to appeal against the decision of the child support officer against a "reduced benefit direction". The proposed amendment of regulation 42 of the maintenance assessment procedure regulations provides that a review of a reduced benefit direction under regulation 42 may be carried out by a child support officer where relevant information is received from the parent with care or from any other person. It also provides that a review will take place when the Secretary of State or a child support officer becomes aware that a question arises as to whether the welfare of a child is likely to be affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, we welcome the fact that it will be possible for a review to take place when a social worker, priest or other person gives assistance to the parent. We also welcome the fact that the interest of the child is given some prominence, although we do not understand how on earth benefit can be taken off the parent without that being harmful to the child. Perhaps the Minister will explain that. The amendment does not alter the procedure up to the review state, nor does it appear to restore the money lose. Perhaps the Minister will correct me if I am wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Child Poverty Action Group summed up the original rules as
	<br><blockquote><p>"one rule for the rich, another for the poor".</p></blockquote>
Lone parents on means-tested benefits have no choice about whether to apply for maintenance. Refusal to do so without good cause results in a substantial reduction in benefit. Parents fortunate enough not to have to rely on means-tested benefits are not forced to apply for maintenance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The CPAG has, consistently opposed the benefit penalty as it believes that the effects of such a penalty will be undue pressure on lone parents, the pursuit of maintenance not in the children's interest and increased poverty caused by a reduction in benefit which is bound to hit children. Regarding undue pressure on lone parents, it says that they are
	<br><blockquote><p>"forced to give inappropriate and highly personal information"</p></blockquote>
to the Benefits Agency's liable relatives officer, under threat of loss of benefit. The CPAG considers
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is the parent with care who has taken on responsibility for the children and yet it is she who will be pressurised and penalised."</p></blockquote>
The effect on the children could be severe.

I know that the Minister has issued guidance to officers which advises them to make some useful points to the parent, and stresses the need for interviews to be handled with care and sensitivity. The guidance also makes it clear that the parent has the right to be believed unless what she says is inherently contradictions or implausible. The advice appears to be generally favourable to the woman in respect of fear of violence, rape and sexual abuse, although it is not totally reassuring. The guidelines state that there may be circumstances in which the parent with care decides that the absent parent should not freed from his responsibility to provide support for the child, particularly if she is reassured that the child support agency will act on her behalf and that her address will not be revealed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is that just another way of saying that there are circumstances in which the agency should use compulsion? In the context of violence, rape and sexual abuse, in what circumstances does the Minister believe that the parent should be forced to apply for maintenance or lose benefit? The parent's secrecy is not the only issue. Many women will be frightened that their actions will provoke the man to find them—we are not providing safe houses for women who fear the men who have left them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The guidance appears to be unsympathetic in certain cases. The fear that the absent parent will want to see the child, the desire to sever links, the desire to protect the other parent, no recent contact and the existence of voluntary arrangements have not been dealt with. Two further cases have not been covered by the guidance: the possibility of disrupting a reconciliation process, and disruption of a new family relationship, especially where a child has accepted the stepfather as her or his father. That is important. It could be exceedingly disruptive for a child to discover that he or she has another father. It will be difficult for the agency to deal with cases when there is a clean break as a result of a divorce. Will the Minister give us some thoughts on that with regard to the regulations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have spoken in detail because I know how important the subject is to many people who have difficulty coping for themselves and for their children. The Minister and the new agency have a substantial responsibility to such people. I hope that the legislation, despite its obvious defects, is administered with the greatest possible compassion, with care being taken to preserve the dignity of all claimants. The system will be closely monitored by many people and I hope that it will prove of great benefit to the many single parents and children who need help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Butterfill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bournemouth, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish briefly to put one or two issues to my hon. Friend the Minister and to tell the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Mrs. Golding) that poor mothers are not the only people in difficulties under the current law. That is best demonstrated by a case that was brought to me by a mother who was divorced some time ago and who now works, and pays for a child minder. Because she supports herself, she is not eligible for income support or for legal aid. For 15 months, the father has paid no maintenance to their two children, and the mother has been trying to enforce payment through the courts. She cannot afford to employ a solicitor because she does not qualify for legal aid and the fees are too high. Additionally, she is trying to repay money that she had to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
borrow from the bank to pay the legal aid costs from her divorce; for some time, that will take any surplus income that she might have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That mother's situation is not unique. She has had difficulties because when she has applied for details of her husband's income, he has ignored her. The court has been of no great assistance in obtaining that information. She made numerous applications through the courts and went to court to explain that she could not afford a solicitor. She was told which forms to fill in and, being an industrious woman, she filled them in and submitted them to the court. She was then told that her case had been dismissed by the judge without her being asked to give any evidence because she had filled in the wrong forms. She returned to the court to ask for the right forms and was again given an erroneous set of forms. She applied to the Lord Chancellor for advice and assistance in getting the court to help her. The Lord Chancellor's advice was that she should engage a solicitor—not the most helpful of responses in the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After 15 months, that mother has been unable to obtain any maintenance from her husband, although she knows that he is working. He claims that he is not, but she has evidence that he is and she knows that he has no fewer than three lodgers who pay substantial amounts to him. He undoubtedly receives a significant income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Admirable though the regulations are, they may not assist my constituent in enforcing her position in the courts. Although the new agency will deal with new cases, it may be sometime before it can deal with cases such as hers. Will my hon. Friend the Minister tell me what advice he would give to a woman in that position? Will he make representations to the Lord Chancellor and ask him to ensure that the courts are more helpful to such mothers and that the court regulations are simplified so that ordinary people can understand them without recourse to a solicitor?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme and my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill). As always, we are discussing the child support regulations in a good spirit. There is common agreement that the principle of what we are trying to do is right, although there is disagreement on some of the ways in which we seek to put into practice what we all believe to be right. I have made it clear previously that my approach to new legislation is to do the best we can to get it right the first time, but to recognise that when making a major change in the way in which something is done, it is impossible to get everything right. We do our best to get everything right but we constantly review the position. As matters are brought to my attention, I shall examine them carefully to see where adjustment will be needed. I have to find the difficult balance between certainty for practitioners, advisers and so on and maximum flexibility for the court to make the necessary changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady raised some general matters which I cannot ignore. Some of the criticisms that have been made of the Act, which she repeated, are not justified. We have kept in very close contact with groups such as the National Council for One Parent Families and the Child Poverty Action Group. They have helped us with the forms and understand the principles behind our provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0345">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
I disagree with the hon. Lady, who said that there would be no benefit to those on income support. We know from all the surveys that one-parent families want to work. The in-work benefit—Family Credit—has a disregard. I do not believe that everyone who is now on income support will remain on it for ever. Most people want to move off it and, when they do so, they will find that having acquired maintenance—which many are unable to do because of the frustrations to which my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West referred—they will have an oportunity to build for the future. It is important for them to have that maintenance in the first place. As opportunities to work arise and family credit applies, there is a disregard as income improves, but the former maintenance remains for the child. If that opportunity is lost initially, it may be difficult to establish that portable maintenance income in the future. That is why we feel strongly that we are right to proceed in the present direction and maintain a distinction between in-work and out-of-work benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept that our policy has been dictated by whatever colour of men are in the Treasury across the road. We often make the point—its worth making again—that the Government and the Treasury do not possess money of their own. It comes from taxpayers and people who make a lot of noise if they feel that they are paying too much for things in which they do not believe. We are trying to reestablish basic principles behind child support. Those are that parents have an obligation to maintain their children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Golding</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated assent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see that the hon. Lady is nodding. Parents have an obligation to maintain their children when they can afford to do so, and the child has the right to be maintained by both parents, regardless of the relationship between them. Most taxpayers are more than willing to step in and look after children if parents cannot afford to, but if parents can afford to and are not doing so, taxpayers are more reluctant, as they should be, to take on the obligation without any further questions being asked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Child Support Agency tries to place the primary obligation for the maintenance of children on parents. As the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme, it is not right for a woman to pursue maintenance from a former partner if there is fear of harm or if undue distress is being caused to her or to any child living with her. We have tried to provide as widely as possible for such circumstances in our guidance—the taxpayer is willing and able to step in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle is that those who have the primary obligation live up to that. It is not wrong to relieve taxpayers who have been carrying an unnecessary burden and paying money for other people's children—they often have families to look after themselves. I reject the charge that the legislation aims simply to save the Government money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the detailed points made by the hon. Lady about the regulations, I shall try to answer as many of her questions as possible. On the complexity of the regulations—I thought that my speech was clear enough- The hon. Lady was following it intently and I thought that I had explained all the points. Yes, the regulations are very detailed. I look forward to officials in the. Department being able to compile a compendium of all the regulations and amendments that we have discussed to ensure that we have a user-friendly guide for all those involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
The regulations are complex but not too complex. We need a lot of detail if regulations are to be tailored to as many individual circumstances as possible. The more broad brush regulations are, the more hazardous they may potentially be because they may not cover individual cases. Every attempt that is made to cover different cases can, potentially, produce more detailed legislation. There is a balance to be struck—we cannot become too detailed or regulations become unworkable. I take the hon. Lady's concern seriously and we shall keep a close eye on the matter to ensure that we are not introducing more regulations than necessary. We are working hard to get that right—I shall keep the matter under review and shall always welcome constructive contributions from Opposition Members and from outside bodies. Regulation 3 amends regulation 8 of the maintenance assessment procedure regulations. Two issues arose from that. The first concerned whether there was an impact on the parent with care and how it affected a partner of an absent parent. The amendment to regulation 8 does not affect the parent with care's benefit. If a parent with care refuses to co-operate, the question of an interim maintenance assessment does not arise, as the procedure would never get that far. In those circumstances, reduced benefit would be considered as normal and if the parent refused to authorise action, the absent parent would not be contacted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other issue concerned why we need information from the new partner. First, information is needed where the parent and partner have a child included in the parent's exempt income. If the partner has sufficient income, only half of the child's personal allowance will be included. Secondly, information is needed for the calculation of an absent parent's protected income where the income of all members of his family is taken into account. As the hon. Lady knows, in essence there is no obligation on the partner of an absent parent to provide information, but without it a full maintenance assessment might not be possible. We feel that it would not be right if, as a result of a partner's failure to provide information, a child was deprived of maintenance. There is no question of a partner being required to contribute towards the maintenance of the absent parent's children. Details of the partner's income will be needed only when we make an allowance in the formula for either the partner or any of the partner's children living with them. That is proper, because the partner has the responsibility to maintain her own children and herself, and should be able to do so. The involvement of the partner is not because of the absent parent's child in the first family but because of any obligations that she may have to her own children and to any children she may have by the absent parent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady also raised questions on regulation 7, which deals with amendment of regulation 17 of the maintenance assessment procedure regulations. Under the provisions of sections 18 and 19 of the 1991 Act and the regulations made under those sections, the parties to the assessment are not required to notify the child support officer of all recent changes in their circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to ensure that an assessment that reflects all changes in the relevant person's circumstances is made annually. Therefore, when an original decision is reviewed under sections 18 or 19 of the Act—the provisions that allow for reviews—the periodic review will be 52 weeks after the original decision, not 52 weeks after the new decision. Without that provision, it might be possible for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0346">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
someone to try to exclude full consideration of the circumstances and delay the date of the full review. If the 52-week review is kept, dated at the orignal point, that full review cannot be evaded by abusing the regulations under sections 18 and 19.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady raised points about the requirement to co-operate and about amendment of regulation 42 of the maintenance assessment procedure regulations by way of regulation 14. I wish to say a brief word about the safeguards on the requirement to co-operate. The hon. Lady and, I am sure, all other members of the Committee, know what my feelings are on this matter and how hard the Government have tried to ensure that, in our guidance, the circumstances that may arise are covered as widely as possible. The last thing we would want is for a woman who was concerned about the possibility of applying for maintenance because of the effects on a previous partner to feel hesitant about coming to the agency. The provisions of the law and the Act have certain consequences in such cases. People should come to the agency to discuss their situation with officers. We have tried to make it as clear as possible that, where there are any reasonable grounds for a woman to fear violence or anythng related to violence that would cause harm or undue distress, provided that the applicant says nothing implausible or inherently contradictory, we shall take her at her word and not pursue maintenance. That means that the adverse consequences, which the hon. Lady mentioned, should not arise. I am anxious to reaffirm at all times that that is what I want to happen. We are asking our officers to be as sensitive as possible when dealing with the variety of difficult situations that may arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Glenda Jackson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hampstead and Highgate)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whose reason will prevail? Who will decide what constitutes reasonable grounds? The decision in this matter will be of major importance. Is it to be made by the officer at the sharp end of the legislation? If the reason of the man or woman sitting behind the desk who has to ask the questions and assess and filter the responses is to prevail, will there be the possibility of an appeal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady. It may be helpful to the Committee if I detail how existing safeguards will work and how a review procedure will be followed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a parent with care is reluctant to co-operate, the Child Support Agency will contact her and discuss her reasons for not wanting to do so. The agency will explain that there are many alternatives if, for example, she wants to avoid personal contact and fears that the agency's application will mean that her address will be given to a former partner, which could lead to physical contact. We shall reassure her that if she does not want her address to be given, we shall handle the matter purely by post. Correspondence will be sent from a regional office, not a local office, so that the area in which she lives will not be identified. If the woman does not want personal contact, we shall ensure that there is none. We could arrange for the agency to collect the money and send it on. That would avoid a direct payment system, although some people would want to use that because it would be convenient where there was no personal difficulty between the parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall try to discover why a woman is concerned and reassure her by trying to meet those concerns. If that were unsatisfactory, there would be a six-week period in which a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
parent with care could think about the circumstances and decide whether to take the matter further and co-operate with us, or to stick to her original view. During that time, we shall consider whether there would be a risk of harm or undue distress. If the child support officer decided that there would be, the matter would be taken no further. However, if the officer was not satisfied that the parent with care had good grounds for not co-operating, the case would go to another child support officer who would give the parent with care two weeks to comply or to make further representations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the child support officer was not satisfied at the end of that period that the parent with care had good grounds for not co-operating, a reduced benefit direction would be issued. There would be full, normal appeal rights to the child support appeal tribunal. The matter could then go to commissioners on a point of law. There is a review process throughout the system. After the internal review in the agency, there would be a right of appeal to an independent body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that helps in describing how the process would work. At some stage, a decision would need to be taken, based on the circumstances presented to the Child Support Agency, on whether there was good cause for not co-operating. I hope that the tenor of my argument and the manner in which the guidelines have been drawn up show in which direction I wish to err if there are doubts about the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme mentioned regulation 14 and the amendment to regulation 42. Regulation 14 deals with three different aspects of reviews of a reduced benefit direction. First, it allows persons other than those with care to make representations for a review of a reduced benefit direction. Secondly, it augments the circumstances in which a review can be made. At present, a review is possible only when additional or new reasons are given about why a parent with care should not have to comply with the obligations under section 6 of the Child Support Act 1991, which is often referred to as naming the father.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members may be aware that when imposing a reduced benefit direction, it is incumbent on a child support officer, or my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, to have regard to the welfare of a child likely to be affected by the decision. The amendment would mean that a review could take place if the welfare of a child might be affected by the reduced benefit direction continuing to be in force. That would augment the rights of review and appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, it has always been our intention that the parent with care may appeal to a child support appeal tribunal if she is aggrieved by a decision following a review. The regulation sets out clearly the legal mechanism by which such an appeal would be made. I shall briefly refer to the matter touched on by my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West about the take-up of cases. That is a difficult matter. We were conscious of the need to ensure that the agency would not be overloaded at first. That is why a take-up of cases has been planned. I shall make available to my hon. Friend details of when new and existing cases will be taken on. We thought it right that the agency should first take on new cases where no maintenance was being paid. The reason we are taking on other cases over a period is simply logistical—to ensure that the agency is not totally swamped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0347">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
My hon. Friend raised questions about court involvement and representations to the Lord Chancellor. The courts will be involved only when enforcement action is taken. There are a wide range of collection methods, including deduction from salary, to improve collection. The fact that the agency is dedicated to ensuring the collection of maintenance means that we shall be able to put more resources into cases in the courts, which are involved in a variety of different enforcement procedures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that deduction of salary through attachment of earnings is an option. In fact, that is what my constituent has been seeking to achieve through the courts. The current situation is that the court says that it has lost the papers. Perhaps my hon. Friend would consider giving greater priority to cases where a court has already made an order but the respondent has failed to comply for a considerable time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand my hon. Friend's point. In those circumstances, a woman in the situation of the constituent mentioned by my hon. Friend might consider revocation of the court order which is clearly useless. She would then come within the Act's provisions because she would be putting forward a new case. I think that that might help my hon. Friend's constituent. That is probably the best and most straightforward advice that I can give.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have spent a reasonable time having a good look at the regulations. Both in technical detail and in general terms, we have considered the interesting and worthwhile subject of child support. I am grateful for the way in which members of the Committee have listened and contributed
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
by asking questions. This is a serious matter. We are determined to get it right. We are aware of the detail of legislation that has been produced and I am sure that many aspects of it will settle down in practice when we get to work after the beginning of April. I assure all members of the Committee that, as work proceeds, I shall keep matters closely under review in the way that I suggested.

I hope that we have been able to enlighten you, in so far as you needed any enlightenment, on the matters before the Committee, which I am sure was not much.
