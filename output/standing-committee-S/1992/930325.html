	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ray Michie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll and Bute)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That the Committee has considered the Loch Crinan Scallops Fishery Order 1993 (S.I., 1993, No. 177).</p></q>
I am grateful to the Leader of the House for arranging for this debate to take place. Although it relates specifically to the Loch Crinan Scallops Fishery Order, which was laid before the House on 5 February, it also gives us the opportunity to discuss similar orders and their effect on the coastal waters and lochs of Scotland. I hope that the Minister will understand and accept the spirit in which the debate was requested. Incidentally, in Scotland "scallops" is pronounced as it is spelt; others may pronounce it "scollops". I shall refer to "scallops".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall concentrate first on Scallop Kings plc, the company which in 1979 applied for a several fishery order to allow it to grow scallops on the sea bed at Loch Crinan in my constituency. In 1988, £1.7 million was raised from private shareholders under the business expansion scheme. Together with grant aid from Highlands and Islands Enterprise, the money was invested in the development of scallop farming technology—with the result, I am told by the managing director, that the company is now a leader in the field. It is expected to farm up to five million scallops a year. It will provide employment and help to meet the substantial home and export demand for scallops. If it fails, it will leave France out in front. There are similar operations there mainly run, interestingly, by fishermen's co-operatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following the failure of Scallop Kings to reach agreement with four objectors to the order, the Secretary of State held a public inquiry. The most significant of the objectors was the Clyde Fishermens Association. The presence today of the secretary of that association, Mr Patrick Stewart shows how seriously it views the matter. Under section 7 of the Sea Fisheries (Shellfish) Act 1967, the association's normal fishing acitivities would not be permissible within the area described in the fishery order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This area is of the utmost importance to the fishermen who have carried on their activities there for generations and should continue to do so. The site is sheltered and free from tide and wave action and is the only suitable and safe place for a considerable distance in which they can carry out activities, such as running off their gear, untangling their nets and removing objects such as boulders or mines, which get caught up in them, gutting fish and tailing prawns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scallop Kings has never sought to strike at the freedoms of the fishermen. On the contrary, it wants the order to be made in terms that will accommodate all those activities without hindrance. That has been confirmed to me by Mr Michael Stewart, Scallop Kings; managing director.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
The Clyde Fishermens Association has no objection in principle to several orders, except where the status quo is threatened and there is a disruption of business. In this case, that is what the several order would do. Granting the order would prohibit the activities that I have described. The association does not object to scallop farming in the area as long as that does not interfere with its activity, and the company wishes to be accommodating. The reporter to the public inquiry took the same view and made recommendations to that effect. The Secretary of State has the authority to vary an order under the Sea Fisheries (Shellfish) Act 1967 and to make the necessary provisions to meet the needs of the fishermen and the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A several order is far too drastic. Under section 7 of the 1967 Act, the normal fishing activities associated with the area would be prohibited altogether. I hope that the Minister will consider making a regulatory order, or even go back to the Sea Fisheries (Scotland) Amendment Act 1985, which allows him to make byelaws for the purposes of fish culture or experiments in such culture. The Sea Fisheries Regulation Act 1966, which applies only to England and Wales, allows local fisheries committees also to make byelaws with regard to operations in their areas. However, such committees do not exist in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will consider the matter again. That is the sensible thing to do. The law should be flexible, and the Secretary of State should be responsive. An order should be made that allows the cultivation of shellfish in Loch Crinan, provided that the operations of the fishermen are not proscribed. If this several order is accepted, the Minsiter would wipe out at a stroke centuries of fishing tradition and would hit at small family businesses. Those businesses were there first and surely have the right to remain. The west coast of Scotland is very dangerous. The safety of the fishermen in my constituency is of prime importance to me. Loch Crinan is a safe haven where fishermen can run for shelter and carry out their work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall say a quick word on the wider issue, which other hon. Members will want to take up. There is a fear that many more several orders for scallop fisheries will be granted—there are abut 17 applications in the pipeline. The Minister will accept that the commercial fishing industry has been going through some bad times. Any further erosion of the customary fishing areas would not be acceptable. Fishermen have been squeezed out already by the proliferation of salmon fish farms, the laying of underwater cable and Ministry of Defence restrictions. Large portions of the sea and sea bed are becoming no-go areas. That is a considerable worry to the commercial fishing industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will give the Committee a favourable answer and that sense will prevail in this part of my constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.39 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, but I wish to support the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie). We have adjacent constituencies and share some common interests, not least in the safety of fishermen. We have been working for years on the issue of nuclear submarines and the safety of fishermen in the Clyde. Fishermen feel threatened in that area. We have held extensive discussions with the MOD about that. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0151">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
Minister should give priority to fishermen's safety and allow them to deploy their boats in the part of Loch Crinan that we are discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady said that the owner of Scallop Kings, Mr. Stewart, has agreed to that; the fishermen want to fish in that part of Loch Crinan. Only the Government prevent it. On 14 March 1993, the Secretary to the Clyde Fishermen's Association said in 	<i>Scotland on Sunday:</i>
	<br><q><p>"Never mind the politics and this landlordism thing".</p></q>
He mentioned landlordism because the several order is a rarely used legislative device; it has never been given to a commercial enterprise. The secretary to the association said that we should forget that. He continued:
	<br><q><p>"The government always seems ready to back something new while failing to support the indigenous industry. Their attitude is deplorable but it is part of history as well as part of current affairs. No account has been taken of the effect on fishermen."</p></q>
The Minister should support the indigenous industry, which is suffering from severe recession. He should accommodate the interests of Scallop Kings and of fishermen. That is the Opposition's plea. We readily support the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.41 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Calum Macdonald 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Western Isles)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute and my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall). The Minister should clarify the scope of the several order. Members of the Western Isles Fishermens Association have approached me and expressed anxiety about the precedent that the order would set. The association is worried that ordinary fishermen will be denied access to and use of the area of Loch Crinan that we are discussing. The reporter to the inquiry said that the Secretary of State had the power to make exemptions to the several order. Such exemptions would allow fishermen to continue with specific activities, for example, creel fishing for species other than scallops. They could thus fish for lobsters or crabs. The reporter said that they should be allowed to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State said in his response to the reporter that although ordinary fishermen would not be allowed to undertake creel fishing, Scallop Kings should be permitted to do that. It is odd to ban ordinary fishermen from using creels for non-scallop shellfish, yet allow Scallop Kings to fish not only for scalops but for other shellfish. That is unfair to local fishermen. It sets a bad precedent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order is silent on those issues. The first page states that
	<br><q><p>"—the Secretary of State appointed an Inspector"</p></q>
to conduct an inquiry. It goes on to say that the inspector reported that,
	<br><q><p>"in his opinion the proposed order should be made subject to certain restrictions".</p></q>
Nevertheless, the list of restrictions does not encompass all the restrictions that the inspector or the reporter proposed. I hope that the Minister will clarify that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is a several order necessary anyway for this type of cultivation? Scallop farms exist and fishermen can go out and fish for scallops. They can obtain leases from the Crown Estate Commissioners in the same way as salmon farmers. The leases allow them to have rafts moored from which scallops can be found. Other apparatus may also be used to find scallops. There is the same protection that is given to salmon farmers. No one is allowed to remove scallops from a raft put out by a fisherman on a Crown
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
Estate lease or from hanging lanterns. Why do scallop fishermen need further protection beyond that already given to salmon fanners?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Current practice is for scallop farmers to collect spat in a way that local fishermen accept. Spat collectors put out anywhere little bundles of netting which attract the spat, which are taken back to rafts to hang out and grow. Will that practice be allowed to continue—it is accepted by local fishermen—or will organisations such as Scallop Kings be allowed to dive or even dredge for immature scallops outside its several order area and bring them back to its area to grow them to maturity? If that is allowed, the fishermen will think it is deeply unfair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that it will not be allowed, but the order makes no provision to prevent it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
England already has the several order system to allow this type of agriculture, but there is a different regulatory system. Under the English system, the whole coastline is covered by local fishery committees which have powers to regulate operations around their coastline for up to six miles. When a several order is made in England, there is consulation with local fishery committees. Scotland has no equivalent; there is merely an opportunity to protest or make a submission to a Government inquiry, after which the Government impose an order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The laying of this type of order raises the question—which has been raised before, but dismissed by the Government—whether similar local fishery committees should be created for Scotland. If the Government intend to proceed with the system of several orders, they must think seriously about setting up local committees so that fishermen can have more say in the handling and planning of future operations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.49 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All of us would much rather be standing outside Crinan hotel in the sunshine than be here this morning. But it is an important order and it is right that the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute should be given a reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One gets an impression from the hon. Lady and the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. MacDonald) that here we have an insensitive Government, introducing an order without any thought for the consequences. That is absolutely wrong. The several order stems from the Sea Fisheries Act 1868—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacDonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From the 1967 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, from the 1868 Act—I shall come to the later legislation—which was introduced by the lord high priest of Liberalism, William Gladstone. It was subsequently amended in 1967 by William Ross, the then Member for Ayrshire and Bute, Kilmarnock. It was consolidated by two other great radical peers, Lord Kilbrandon and Lord Scarman. So one cannot say that the several order has been a great Tory plot introduced to allow scallop fishing in Crinan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
The purpose of a several order is to encourage the establishment or the improvement of a shell fishery. It is designed to enhance and improve fisheries, not to reduce or to restrict them. Because such orders extinguish certain public rights, Parliament has provided a procedure which allows full and open consultation. That procedure permits anyone with an interest in the matter to have his or her views considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An order must be advertised in draft form in the locality, which has been done. Objectors are given a month to state their views and put their objections to the Minister. If objections are received, the applicant is given an opportunity to resolve them by negotiation with the parties concerned. If he cannot do so, and if the objections are not frivolous or irrelevant, an inspector will be appointed to hold a public inquiry. If, after that procedure, the order is allowed to proceed, the instrument must be laid before Parliament. That is when hon. Members have a legitimate right to pray against it. It is a carefully set-out procedure which the Government take particularly seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order has been considered with particular care. I have already explained that the legislation stemmed from the last century, but it was amended in 1967. In Scotland, only one order has been passed, the experimental order by the Sea Fish Insdustry Authority. The order which we are now debating is the second one. As there are more in the pipeline, it is right that this order should be given careful consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several techniques to cultivate scallops have been tried. The applicant in this case—Scallop Kings—has concluded that bottom culture, or ranching, is the way ahead. That involves sowing juvenile scallops on the sea bed. For that technique to be successful, the company needs to have some legal protection for its stock, to avoid them being taken by third parties. That, in essence, is what the order provides. It gives a shellfish farmer legal title to his stock in a particular area and it prevents others from taking or injuring that stock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is misleading to describe several orders as landlordism of the sea. If practised properly, shellfish ranching can complement fishing activity. In some cases, the natural spat-fall from a cultivated bed will spread beyond the immediate area and may benefit the public fishery, because it takes pressure off the remaining area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute will have seen from the designation of the area, it is only a small area—about 290 hectares—and it is marked off by four buoys, so that everybody knows exactly where it is. She is right to highlight the importance and the balance that we must all take in this matter with reference to employment. The hon. Lady and the hon. Member for Western Isles have tried as hard as anyone else to achieve more employment. Scallop Kings anticipates an increase in employment if the scallop fishery develops. As the hon. Lady said, it is supported by Highlands and Islands Enterprise, which shows that it, too, feels that that matter is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The applicants have chosen the site with particular care. Its shallow depth is suitable for harvesting by divers, the only method of harvesting that will be allowed. The company already has interests in a boatyard in the area. The order will have virtually no impact. In general, the operation will be environmentally friendly. It will not affect sailing or fishing boats in the Crinan. They can sail with impunity, through the area that is buoyed off. Sailing and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
other boats can anchor in the area; it is not sterilised and cut off from all operations except for the taking of scallops off the sea bed, which is where the investment is in the future of the fishery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no evidence of a significant fishery in the area. There are two or three creelers; as far as we can ascertain, the output is about 1 tonne. As the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute said, there will be a substantial increase in output, which will bring considerable rewards in terms of employment and improve the economy of the Crinan area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should consider the order in a positive way, because it will have so many advantages. We have looked carefully at the difference between a regulating and a several order. The applicant applied for a several order; he does not want to regulate all fishing in the area, only the right to control the stock that he has laid on the sea bed, from which he will develop his income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Western Isles and the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute raised the issue of safety. I cannot understand how that arises; as I said, any boat can sail through the area and anchor there. The order will make no difference whatever.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ray Mitchie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In fact, safety is paramount. Fishermen come into the area because it is a safe haven where they can untangle their gear, gut fish and so on. They need to do that in an area that is free from storms, wind and tide. I did not say that they wanted to fish in the area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady implied that the fact that this was a restricted area would affect the safety of boats, but boats can anchor there or sail through to the mouth of the canal, as many boats do. It is an exaggeration to say that the order will present a major safety hazard; if it does, we shall look at it very carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have considerable control over the order; I state categorically that if it does not work it can be withdrawn. However, I am confident that there will be no problems. We should encourage this development and consider each application on its merit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Western Isles asked about boats lifting and relaying immature scallops. From 1 May, all boats must be registered and have a licence. If, rather than improving the fishery, lifting immature scallops made it substantially worse, that would be unacceptable and we would carefully watch the situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How will it be watched? I do not understand how the licensing of vessels will help. Other vessels could be paid to do the lifting, take the scallops to the several order area and plant them there. I do not understand how the Minister can envisage such a practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fact that the boats must be registered and licensed from 1 May is important, but the several order's purpose is to improve the fishery as a whole, not only within the restricted area. Lifting immature scallops from outside that area and planting them within it would not improve the overall fishery and would not be acceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I freely grant the Minister's intention and agree that what he has described would not be acceptable. However, I do not understand how proper monitoring could work or the relevance of the licensing scheme. Scallop Kings has no licensed vessels, but it could hire other boats to do the job. The landing of immature fish

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
of any species is monitored when fisheries officers check the size of fish offered for sale. The operation which has been described would not involve selling the scallops, merely their transfer from one part of the sea bed to another. I do not understand how that could be monitored.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has his view; mine is that such activity could be monitored. If it went on, people would soon know and would deprecate it as something that would not improve the fishery.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some months ago, the secretary to the Western Isles Fishermens Association described to me a conversation between two scallop divers which he had overheard in a local bar. The divers had talked freely about their intention to obtain a several order for a particular area. Their plan was to dive for immature scallops and then to transfer them to their newly granted, several order area, where the scallops would continue to grow. I do not know whether that pair of divers has applied for the several order area yet, but that is the way that people are thinking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is interesting evidence. I hope that such evidence is brought to the attention of the public inquiries that will precede any further orders. Such inquiries are part of the consultative process which has been gone into so carefully by the reporter and by the officials who dealt with objectors before the inquiry was called.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must strike a balance on the question whether we wish to make progress. The hon. Members for Argyll and Bute and for Western Isles have tried to provide evidence that the order will have a dramatic effect on fishing, but we must weigh that against the possibility that it will be a great success and a way of regenerating employment and the economy of the highlands and the Western Isles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After the consultation, the public inquiry and the careful thought that the matter has received, I believe that the order should be accepted. We shall carefully watch the way in which matters develop, and the experience gained from Loch Crinan can be used to decide whether further orders should be approved. As the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute said, about 17 applications have been made from all over the western highlands and as far north as Orkney.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should take this opportunity to see how matters develop. As I said, if anything goes wrong, the Secretary of State can withdraw the order and consider the matter further. I believe that the order should be accepted, in the interest of the future of fishing in the highlands and the Western Isles. I hope that it will be a positive development.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.4 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ray Michle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed by the Minister's reply. I thought that he would try to accommodate the ideas from Scallop Kings. The company has no objection to fishermen carrying out activities that they have followed for many years. The several order is far too draconian and rigid and is unnecessary. I accept that the Minister would be willing to look again at the order if necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not answer the question from the hon. Member for Western Isles about the possibility of setting up local fisheries committees in Scotland which would have the same input as those in England. I accept that the Government followed proper procedures and held a public inquiry and that it has taken three and a half years to bring forward the order. The Minister spoke of the company
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
getting legal title to its stock under the order. The Clyde Fishermen's Association does not want the company's stock; the association has no intention of doing anything that would upset it. Scallop Kings has said that it would be happy for the fishermen to continue their activities in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister questioned our raising the safety issue. I cannot stress too strongly that it is extremely important. He did not mention the fishermen's activities. A statement from one Clyde fisherman reads:
	<br><q><p>"The most important point is in relation to the handling of gear. The site in question is sheltered and is not subject to the strong tides which operate in the remainder of the Sound of Jura. It is the only place over a wide area which can be used for the handling of gear. This is particularly important if obstructions such as boulders"—</p></q>
and mines, to which I referred earlier—
	<br><q><p>"are trapped in the nets In the event of this area being lost the work would have to be carried out in a place where strong tides could be met. In such an operation the effects of strong tides could be very serious and may give rise to dangers not only to the vessel but also the people working on her."</p></q>
The Minister said that the order would create employment in the area. I do not know to what extent that will happen because it has not started, but I hope that it will. Weighed against that there is the question of the employment of family fishing boats, which are extremely important to Argyll and Bute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's decision will not help local relationships. I am disappointed that he is not prepared to give a bit because he has the right to do so under the terms of the Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Lady, I am disappointed. I grant that the Minister has good intentions. I do not rule out the need to experiment to develop new sources of industry and income and new enterprises, especially along the west coast of Scotland, where average incomes are so low and unemployment so high. We need new sources of employment from wherever they are to be found. I accept the need to experiment, but it has to be done more sensitively that the order allows, especially when the fishermen fishing industry is under severe pressure and in crisis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was disappointed by the Minister's reply to the point about poaching juvenile scallops from other areas. I do not understand how that can be monitored. The Government constantly complain that every year vast quantities of black fish are landed up and down the Scottish coast. If that can happen without the Government's knowledge and they are unable to prevent it, they cannot hope to prevent the transfer about which fishermen and I are anxious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not answer the point about creel fishing. Why will he not allow fishermen to undertake creel fishing within the several order area? Why should scallop farming prevent local fishermen from creel fishing for lobsters or crabs? Allowing such fishing would set an example for other several order areas and would help to mollify fishermen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fishermen are not worried principally about loss of opportunity to fish for scallops in several order areas. They have anticipated that those areas are not especially good for normal scallop fishing. However, they are worried about the loss of other fishing rights. If the Minister fulfilled the reporter's recommendation and allowed non-scallop creel fishing to continue in the several order area, he would make a major concession to local fishermen not only in Loch Crinan but in other parts of Scotland. I do not understand why the Minister will not allow that. I invite
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0154">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
him to intervene now to explain why it is impossible to follow the reporter's recommendation to allow fishermen to undertake creel fishing for species other than scallops. I invite him to state that Scallop Kings will not be allowed to fish for species other than scallops if local fishermen are to be prevented from doing that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should acknowledge that it is important to act sensitively and obtain the support of the fishing industry. There could be a scramble for several orders up and down the coast as people make a dash to farm off a piece of territory. We should set up a structure similar to that which exists in England, where local fishery committees provide a means of democratic input for local fishermen. If the practice of several orders is to be pursued in Scotland, the Government must re-examine the question of setting up local fishery committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The simple answer to why I cannot allow creeling in the restricted area is because the Act prevents it. The Act restricts specific activities, such as creeling. I cannot give dispensation for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that Scallop Kings is prohibited from creeling within the several order area?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is allowed only to creel for predators.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I presume that predators include crabs. If Scallop Kings is allowed to creel fish for crabs in the several order area, why are local fishermen not permitted to do so? A happy, harmonious relationship could exist between local fishermen and Scallop Kings. Scallop Kings could ask local fishermen to get rid of the predators and thus make some money. Scallop Kings is not averse to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know why the hon. Gentleman is making such a meal of it. Scallop Kings has a good relationship with local fishermen and there is every likelihood that quite a lot of creeling will continue. It may be said that that is outwith the order and that it should not be encouraged, but Scallop Kings would have to police such creeling. If it did not do so, then so be it. One must not try to stir up disharmony where none may exist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ray Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely, if local fishermen brought in creels and were policed by Scallop Kings, that would not change the fact that they would be breaking the law under the section 7 several order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that that one would find that unlikely. The restriction in the Act applies only to third parties, not to the grantee of the several order. Nothing will be achieved by changing this order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That goes against the understanding of the reporter, who noted that paragraph 1(6), paragraph 2(1) and paragraph 6 of schedule 1 to the Sea Fisheries (Shellfish) Act 1967 mean that the Secretary of State could
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
allow such an arrangement for the benefit of local fishermen. Such an arrangement would not harm Scallop Kings, but it would go a long way towards reassuring fishermen in all areas that they will not be excluded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Notwithstanding the contents of the report, my legal advice is that it is clear that dispensations cannot be made. All relevant sections of the 1967 Act must appear in the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Minister's courtesy in giving way. This is an important discussion of what may happen up and down the coast. Although the 1976 Act is restrictive, the Minister has acknowledged that the reporter's suggestion was reasonable and that there would be no harm in an arrangement such as has been described. However, if several orders are to be allowed for areas up and down the coastline, would the Minister consider amending the relevant Act to allow an activity that he has acknowledged would be reasonable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course—if a good case were made, although the hon. Gentleman knows the difficulty of finding a slot for legislation if the decision was taken to proceed. We are always looking to improve legislation. Perhaps more than any other legislation, fisheries legislation is evolving all the time. However, the correct procedures must be followed when applications are made under an Act of Parliament. That is what has been done with the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should look forward constructively. This is an exciting new development, which I hope will help the local economy and improve the fishery. I am sure that it will be a great asset to Loch Crinan and to all those who live around it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
