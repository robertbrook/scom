	<p>[MR JAMES HILL 	<i>in the Chair]</i></p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='legislation'>Draft Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries (Repeals) (Northern Ireland) Order 1992</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed.</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries (Repeals) (Northern Ireland) Order 1992.—	<i>[Mr. Atkins.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Londonderry, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a short order. It seems from the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries (Northern Ireland) Order 1979 and repeals the part of that order which provided assistance to the shipbuilding and aircraft industries in Northern Ireland at that time. Since the privatisation of those industries and the two companies concerned, one assumes that the need for assistance has disappeared.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order does not repeal all the 1979 order; it leaves a number of bits and pieces in place. One wonders why some parts are being left, or were they repealed at an earlier stage? That may well be the case and it may have escaped me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is clear that the Order repeals paragraphs 6, 7, 8 and 10 in their entirety, and paragraph 2(2)(b) is also repealed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful for an explanation why some of the 1979 order has been left in place. Is it to provide a framework for future assistance to the companies and industries in Northern Ireland should that be desired or considered necessary or expedient at some future date?
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
I note that "a relevant company" is also a principal company. We are actively repealing that term in the first line of paragraph 3, but leaving it in other paragraphs, which seems to suggest that the term is left intact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May we have a general explanation of the position once those measures are repealed, and some idea of how much will be left of the original Shipbuilding Industry (No. 2) (Northern Ireland) Order 1975, which was superseded by the 1979 Order? What relevance does it have to shipbuilding in Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.32 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Robert Atkins)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Department of Economic Development retained ownership of the old company, Harland and Wolff Plc, and is responsible for its remaining liabilities. The Member for Londonderry, East (Mr. Ross) is not wrong in pointing to that fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, the Department retained responsibility for those subsidiaries of Shorts which had financial obligations relating to aircraft sales financing. For technical legislative reasons, the relevant companies were made subsidiaries of Harland and Wolff Plc.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Harland and Wolff Plc has continuing obligations and the Department may need to assist that company. Only those paragraphs of the 1979 order which are no longer relevant are being repealed at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure the hon. Gentleman will realise that financing aircraft is an inexact science, which it is difficult for the market to accept. To that extent we have to retain some control, although we should like to be rid of it as soon as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries (Repeals) (Northern Ireland) Order 1992.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<i>Committee rose at twenty-six minutes to Eleven o 'clock.</i></p>
