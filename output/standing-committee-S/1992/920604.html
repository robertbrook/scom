DRAFT ANATOMY (NORTHERN IRELAND) ORDER 1992</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. Jeremy Hanley)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Anatomy (Northern Ireland) Order 1992.</p></blockquote>
The order, which replaces the Anatomy Acts of 1832 and 1871, brings the law in Northern Ireland, somewhat belatedly, into line with that in the rest of the United Kingdom. The main changes incorporated are: a clearer definition of the duties and responsibilities of licence holders, the provision that parts of the body may, in certain circumstances, be retained after anatomical examination, a limited power of entry to licensed premises and powers to allow the Department to make regulations. The order represents a necessary updating of the present law. It is a modest measure, but it has importance for medical science. I commend the order to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>10.31 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has said that the order has been introduced somewhat belatedly. I understand that some hon. Members may want to get away quickly, but, since the main Bill was introduced eight years ago and it has taken that time for the order to come before the Committee, I want to ask why the original Act covered the whole of the United Kingdom while the amending Act covered England, Wales and Scotland with specific reference to Scotland. Why has the order taken so long? Is it because there is a lack of communication between Departments and because the Northern Ireland Office continues to work within its own orbit rather than saving the time of the House and hon. Members? Legislation such as this could have been passed eight years ago.<br><br>
I welcome the order, but dispute the method of legislation, especially when, from time to time, the argument is advanced that Northern Ireland has its own corpus of legislation which should be kept separate. Scotland has had its own corpus of legislation for longer than Northern Ireland yet some Bills passed in the House keep Scottish legislation separate. In future, the relevant Minister in the Northern Ireland Office should keep in touch with what is happening here and bring his Department up to date in order to save the time of hon. Members.<br><br>
I appreciate that the order will affect only a small number of people in Northern Ireland, but it still represents a valuable part of the teaching process. I understand that there have been no significant problems with the old system and that those involved do not anticipate any problems with the new one. They have been encouraged by the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
positive feedback from relatives who have been affected by this sort of legislation. The order is the most effective means of continuing to provide support throughout the Province.<br><br>
However, there is one cause for concern and it is the definition of "lawfully in possession." The British Medical Association believes that, in theory, the definition could be open to debate, but I suspect that, in the majority of cases, that is unlikely in practice. In that context, I refer to section 6(8) of the second edition of the BMA's publication "Rights and Responsibilities of Doctors", which states that executors, relatives or managers of an institution where a death has occurred may dispute matters. However, I believe that in Northern Ireland, despite the British Medical Association's views on the matter, that is unlikely to happen as donations are not accepted unless there is a positive commitment by those involved, including the relatives and those committed to the needs of anatomical study. I understand that in Northern Ireland what we might call strays are not accepted, or disputed cases.<br><br>
Despite what has happened in Copenhagen, we are in a European context. Developments in others parts of Europe lead some of us to question whether the same could happen here, even within the context of our legislative system. In France, for example, the process is different in that donations are made to science in general and may end up with military and other institutions which are testing for the consequences of impact on the human body. I know that the Minister will put our minds at rest by saying that that cannot happen under our legislation. However, bearing in mind the recent controversy in other countries over the use of tissues for cosmetics, I would like to think that we are introducing sufficient safeguards to prevent that from happening in our own land.<br><br>
The fines for offences are low. Admittedly, cases are rare. The impact of such a case on a professional career would be enormous and would probably deny that person the opportunity to practice ever again. However, when the original measure was introduced, the fines were £200 to £300 and from 1 May they were increased to £400, but at level 3 the fine in Great Britain is to go up to £1,000. Will that increase be extended to Northern Ireland, or will we keep to the current level?<br><br>
There are good points in the order, which I commend. The retention of parts, for example, is helpful, particularly given the developments in modern science. There is now a legal basis for the keeping of parts indefinitely. I also welcome the fact that licences will be more practical under the order. They will not be issued to all students, but to those with authority over them. The role of the inspector is invaluable in ensuring standards and also, as a licensor, in giving confidence to relatives and the public. Finally, I welcome the fact that records will be maintained and that one will be able to change one's mind. That was not the case in the past.<br><br>
I welcome this belated order and hope that it may be the last of such unnecessary measures.</span></p>
<p>10.38 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his interest in the order and also for the his great service, to the House and to the Province on health matters in general. The Select Committee on Health, in particular has benefitted from his experience over the years, and I hope that he will serve on that Committee again.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0018">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
The hon. Gentleman is right that there has been a delay in presenting this order on the law in Northern Ireland. The first four years of the delay were because the original measure was delayed for four years from coming into force. The last four years' delay, however, has been because of an unprecedented level of work at the Department of Health and Social Services in Northern Ireland of which you, Sir Giles, were a distinguished Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Sadly not, but I might have been.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, you were a distinguished Minister for Northern Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Undoubtedly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Two orders have taken a long time to go through the House. That is the reason for the delay. At least we shall pass this order today.<br><br>
I assure the hon. Gentleman that compliance is very good. Level three is the current limit for fines. Pending any increase, the maximum fine under that level is three months' imprisonment which, compared with any financial penalty, is I hope, severe enough to deter those who would break the law.<br><br>
Possession was mentioned. It is perhaps best that I write to the hon. Gentleman about strays. There is no doubt that any person with lawful possession of a body can make a body available, but the school of anatomy must decide whether it will accept the body. If there are problems about the possibility of pathogens in the body, it would not accept the body anyway. I could write to the hon. Gentleman in more detail about that.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned the possible use of tissue for cosmetics or for any other purpose about which we have recently read. The Human Tissue Act (Northern Ireland) 1962 would cover such matters, but I can write to the hon. Gentleman to clarify that aspect in due course.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
<p><span class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way on that point?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but before the hon. Gentleman speaks, I should say that the order relates solely to the medical use of material.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a particular interest in that matter. The Minister said that the Human Tissue Act (Northern Ireland) covers the possible use of tissue for cosmetics or other purposes. I had long correspondence with the Minister shortly after being elected and was assured that such uses did not occur. But there are now misgivings because we have no way of detecting such use. There may be a law preventing it but, in my judgment, the policing of that law leaves something to be desired.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can only assure the hon. Gentleman that I shall write to him again or that my noble Friend the Minister with reponsibility for health will write to him in due course if anything else from the Committee needs to be dealt with.<br><br>
I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his interest and shall ensure that any questions that I have not answered will be answered in correspondence in the shortest possible time. I am also grateful for the attention paid to this matter by the other Members of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Anatomy (Northern Ireland) Order 1992.</p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Committee rose at eighteen minutes to Eleven o 'clock.</i></p>
