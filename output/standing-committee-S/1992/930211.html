<br><br><!-- lb --> (Contained Use) Regulations 1992</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 am </p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Islington, South and Finsbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Genetically Modified Organisms (Contained Use) Regulations 1992 (S.I. 1992, No. 3217.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the Genetically Modified Organisms (Deliberate Release) Regulations 1992 (S.I. 1992, No. 3280) and the Genetically Modified Organisms (Contained Use) Regulations 1993 (S.I. 1993, No. 15).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is vital that these instruments are properly debated because they relate to important ethical and practical issues. The genetic altering of plants and animals for beneficent purposes should be carried out only under the strictest and most rigorous control. That is what we are discussing today. If humankind is playing God, we must ensure that it is for the right purposes and in the best possible way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Genetic engineering offers great possibilities for developing new medicines, improving agriculture and cleaning up pollution. Therefore, the Opposition have no desire to delay research and development, but we want to ensure that it is undertaken in the right way. Genetic modification carries great risks—especially if genetically modified organisms are released into the environment deliberately or by accident, because it is almost impossible to reverse that process. Release should take place only in controlled circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I deal with some of the specific issues in the instruments, I will make three general points. First, the existing 1989 regulations, which cover much of the material covered by these statutory instruments, are viewed with considerable respect. In particular, the involvement of workplace safety committees in consultation and information gathering has been extremely valuable. We need to be careful when making changes to ensure that they are for the better because the existing regulatory system has served reasonably well in the past couple of years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, an enormous number of ethical issues stem from the genetic engineering of plants and animals, especially in relation to the consumption of food derived from genetically modified organisms. I know that the Government intended to establish a committee to consider the ethical issues involved, and that the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Food has appointed an independent expert group to be chaired by the Rev. John Polkinghorne. Is that the ethical review committee that the Government had in mind to oversee the consumption and treatment of genetically modified organisms? If so, why does it contain no representatives of the Jewish, Muslim or Hindu faiths? Such representatives would have trenchant ethical views, especially about the use of genetically modified organisms in food products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, when a product of genetic engineering is to be released into the environment in this country, it comes under the release regulations that we are discussing this morning. If it is not released into the environment but remains at the laboratory stage, it is covered by the contained use regulations—yet if that product is to be exported and not used in this country, it will still be covered only by the contained use regulations, which to some extent are less tight than the deliberate release regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is that so? Surely the same standards applicable to release in this country should apply to release elsewhere. A product that is destined for export should fall under the release regulations, rather than only the regulations for contained use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having made those general points, I shall now turn to the meat of the statutory instrument, about which a number of questions arise. Information will be made available to the public by means of the registers that will be compiled. The obligation to provide registers results from the Environmental Protection Act 1990. I pay tribute to my hon. Friends who, during the passage of that legislation, pressed for public registers to be included among the provisions. However, the proposals in the regulations as to what should be included in the registers leave something to be desired.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle should be a presumption in favour of including the maximum information, rather than the minimum. The Government say all the time that they are in favour of greater openness. There could be no more trenchant reminder of the need for more open Government than the news yesterday about the content of apple juice. The situation was made worse because information was not made available to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Openness is most important. I am worried that the statutory instruments will not guarantee sufficient openness. The Community directives that gave birth to the regulations are very clear on that subject. They make it clear that matters such as a description of the organism and the purpose and location of the release, if applicable, should be included in the public register. Directive 90/220/EEC stipulates that such details should be included even though they may be commercially confidential. It is clear that the European Community wants the register to contain the maximum amount of information, even if it could be argued that it conflicts with commercial confidentiality. The regulations do not conform to the spirit of that directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0308">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
The deliberate release regulations require that the registers contain detailed information if the applicant wants to market genetically modified organisms or if such information has been published already. If, however, the information has not already been published and the application is not for marketing, the register need only contain much more general information, such as an overall description and the purpose and location of release. If a release is performed simply to test a product in an area—with all the environmental consequences that may have—the requirement to make that information available to the public is much lighter than if the company wanted to market that organism. Why? Both cases involve release to the environment and the potential ecological consequences that would follow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The contained use regulations allow for information that might harm an applicant's competitive position to be withheld. Types of information that may not be kept confidential are listed, but even they may be excluded from the register if
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is necessary to withhold, for the time being, certain of the information … to protect … intellectual property rights".</p></blockquote>
The Government appear to operate on the principle that information on contained use should be made available only if it does not affect the patentability of a product. The commercial requirements of patenting seem to be the Government's highest priority, rather than the provision of information to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth remembering that the contained use regulations are the more important of the two sets before us. About 5,000 contained use projects are under way in Britain at the moment, whereas only 20 release proposals have been made. The activity covered by the contained use regulations will be much greater than that covered by the deliberate release regulations. Moreover, contained use largely takes place during experimentation, and therefore is likely to have greater potential for danger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The permission in the contained use regulations to withhold information if a company's competitive position could be harmed by its release flies in the face of European Community directives. Directive 90/219/EEC states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In no case may the … information … be kept confidential".</p></blockquote>
The Government seem to be making a confidentiality provision that is not permitted by the directive. Nor is there any definition of how long "the time being"—the phrase used in the statutory instrument—might last. How do the Government interpret "the time being"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unlike the deliberate release regulations, those for contained use do not require information to be included on the register as soon as it is published elsewhere. What is the reason for that difference between the two sets of regulations? If publication elsewhere means immediate inclusion on the deliberate release register, why does not the same apply to the contained use register?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
There is a clear danger that public registers of both deliberate release and contained use will include little information—certainly not enough to be of use to the public, who might wish to object. The Government have taken too much notice of lobbying by the industry and of anxieties about commercial confidentiality and potential patent rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
European patent law means that the release of information, even to a statutory body under statute could curtail a company's right to a patent, and the Government failed to reconcile those issues in the regulations. They tipped the balance too much in favour of commercial interests and not enough in support of the public's need to know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If information is to be withheld, it is vital that the process by which judgments about commercial confidentiality have been made is open to scrutiny. The arguments advanced by the applicant in defence of the confidentiality criterion should be made available to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from the issue of commercial confidentiality, there are several ways in which the registers could be improved. The data included should be that which the applicant provides—raw data—rather than just a summary, which may mislead the public. Applicants should be encouraged to provide additional or backup information, which should be available to the public on request. That would be entirely in accordance with the provisions of the European Community's freedom of access to environmental information directive, which the Government endorsed, and which was debated on the Floor of the House in December 1992.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The deliberate release register will contain advice given by the advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment—ACRE—as required by the Environmental Protection Act 1990. However, the contained use register will not contain advice given by the Advisory Committee on Genetic Modification—presumably because that is not required by the 1990 Act. Including that advice would increase the value of the registers, improve the level of debate and be consistent with environmental freedom of information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why has a different principle been applied to the deliberate release register? The advice of both advisory statutory bodies should be included on both registers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Four basic principles are at stake in relation to the registers and openness. First, there should be full information on the registers—it should not be truncated by misguided applications of confidentiality. Secondly, the same criteria should apply in most respects to both contained use and deliberate release registers. Thirdly, there should be openness about not only products but the procedure used to arrive at a decision of confidentiality or non-confidentiality. Fourthly, back-up information and advisory body information should be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0309">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
Applicants for consent to release an organism into the environment will be required to undertake an environmental risk assessment, on the basis of which the Advisory Committee on Releases into the Environment will decide whether to grant the application. The risk assessment will be placed on the public registers. So far, so good. The guidance notes issued by the Government state that the risk has to be "as low as possible". They state also that the best available technology not entailing excessive cost—BATNEEC—has to be used to reduce risk. It is not clear how BATNEEC applies to genetically modified organisms. It would be useful if the Government will confirm the level of risk that they believe is acceptable. Is no risk the only acceptable procedure? I suspect not—but if a small risk is acceptable, what criteria will the Government apply and how do they intend to implement the BATNEEC principle in practice? The assessment process should be open to public scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The original draft of the regulation stated that the applicant would have to reapply every three months. That was rightly deleted from subsequent regulations on the ground of impracticality. However, these regulations are non-specific. They state that consent will be granted to cover "a limited period", but that is not defined. The guidance notes state that it will cover a five to 10-year product development programme. Therefore, applicants will not be required to carry out the step-by-step environmental risk assessment, as the product is developed, that we believe is necessary. The onus will be on companies or researchers—they will decide whether their experiments have changed sufficiently to make a new consent application necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In discarding the three-month provision, the Government have swung to the opposite end of the spectrum and have left it to the company involved to decide whether to reapply during that five to 10-year period. We believe that is not tough enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the relatively early stage of most of the technology involved in genetic engineering and the lack of understanding of the receiving environment—we know little about what some of the organisms will get up to when they are released into the environment—those involved in genetic modification should be required to report on their work to the relevant committee annually at least. That would allow the review committee to consider how research is developing and the potential risks. Those reports should be made available to not only the reviewing committee but the public. To ensure parliamentary as well as public scrutiny, ACRE should be required to produce an annual report to Parliament. Is that the Government's intention? We should know what the regulatory bodies are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall make three important points on the control of releases and the assessment of risk. First, the Government must clarify what consititutes an acceptable level of risk. They have not done that in
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
the regulations. Secondly, re-evaluation should take place regularly—at least annually—and should not be left entirely in the heads of the proposer. Thirdly, public reports on the companies' and review bodies activities should be available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Information available to the public in the registers, and the level of risk that the Government are prepared to accept when genetically modified organisms are released into the environment, are the two most important issues. However, I want to discuss briefly three other points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scope of the contained use regulations does not cover the environmental risks associated with the contained use of genetically modified organisms that are not micro-oranisms—for example, whole plants or animals that are regarded as genetically modified organisms. That will omit a potentially significant amount of environmental data from the register. The Government should tackle that loophole. Do they envisage further regulations to deal with genetically modified organisms that are not micro-organisms?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious about the resources that will be available for review, scrutiny and monitoring. The number of GMOs released will inevitably increase. Only 20 proposals are in prospect, but that number will rise as more of the 5,000 current contained use projects become deliberate release proposals. As the number of applications for release increases, so will the need for additional resources, to enable the Department of the Environment's agencies and the Health and Safety Executive to scrutinise applications thoroughly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government must ensure sufficient resources to inspect contained use and release sites. Do the Government intend to ensure that those resources are made available? If not, do they intend to include genetically modified organism release in their proposals for the self-monitoring of industrial discharges? Currently, the Government intend to reduce the level of cover that Her Majesty's inspectorate of pollution and the National Rivers Authority will provide. The proposed environmental protection agency will also provide reduced monitoring. The Government will pick and choose when intervention and monitoring will occur and will insist on self-declaration and self-monitoring by industrial companies. Do the Government intend to apply that principle to genetically modified organism release?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am even more worried about that than I am about their proposal for the self-monitoring pollution discharges. I hope that the Minister will give the Committee a firm undertaking that regulation and scrutiny will be strict and thorough, and that the necessary resources will be made available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to plant breeders' rights, for a long time, plant breeders have had the right to copyright their plants through what are called, "plant breeders' rights". The Government propose to strengthen those rights even
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0310">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
further by, for example, allowing plant breeders to charge royalties on seed kept by farmers from crops grown from the breeders' seed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where a farmer plants genetically modified seed and grows a crop, that crop will regenerate itself and subsequent crops will be subject to a royalty from the company that initially developed the seed. That will give great power and revenue to the multinational companies that control most of the large-scale plant breeding and biotechnological research around the world. It will also penalise farmers—including, potentially, small farmers in the developing world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will claim that multinational companies—the plant breeders—need a flow of extra resources to maintain a decent research programme, to develop new strains to improve agricultural produce. That may be true, but by insisting that the farmer pays a royalty, the Government are instituting a gravy train for multinational agricultural business companies that develop seeds and other products at the expense of farmers and farming communities. Is that what the Government are up to? If so, I do not think that they should do that. The Government are pushing the pendulum too hard and fast towards the interests of multinational producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the Opposition's principal concerns. The Government should study such areas more seriously and carefully. They have given in too readily—as they always do—to commercial interests. They should have public interest and the public's right to know and more in mind, and protect them from unnecessary and undue risks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, we must ensure that research into and the development of benign products—such as helpful, medical products—can continue and flourish. At the same time, we must ensure that the public are properly protected. We do not believe that the Government have got it right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.2 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for the Environment and Countryside (Mr. David Maclean)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have the opportunity of debating the questions raised by a relatively new technology that offers great potential for increasing the already demonstrated benefits that genetic manipulation bring—as the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) said in his opening remarks. From the hon. Gentleman's remarks, I detect that he does not want to vote against these important regulations. His intention is to give them an airing so that hon. Members have a chance to debate them. I welcome his purpose, although I was concerned initially that he intended to vote against the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations strike exactly the right balance. I have considerable respect for the hon. Gentleman—although I had doubts after some of his recent interventions in the House, and I still reserve my judgment. It was slightly naughty of him to attack the regulations, and to suggest that we have the balance
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
all wrong, and then add the throwaway line, "Of course, we are strongly committed to ensuring that we have proper research and that we are making wonderful medical improvements and supporting development." He knows that if we went completely overboard for complete freedom of information, as he seems to suggest we should, companies would close down their genetic manipulation research, as has happened elsewhere in the world, and pursue other, more conducive, research.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations address the environmental and human health and safety of genetically modified organisms. They make provision in relation to the availability of public information and complete the implementation of two Community directives. I hope that the Committee does not vote against them as their annulment would be a backward step for safety, research, industry and the public. It would also inhibit the building of international confidence in United Kingdom-based research and products, and particularly in the ability to clear products for the whole of the Community market.

GMOs raise environmental and human and health safety questions because they are generated by rapid and novel techniques that produce heritable genetic changes. In some circumstances, their artificially generated characteristics may persist in the environment or spread to other organisms, including humans, in ways where potential effects may not be obvious. That is the basis of many people's fears about genetic manipulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The extent of the risks from GMOs is likely to vary considerably from case to case. A large degree of experience of the risks presented by the use of certain GMOs in well defined situations, particularly in contained use, has already been gathered over the past 20 years. As a result, all but a few of such operations use low risk organisms. Experience of other uses of GMOs, particularly their deliberate release to the environment, is less common but is growing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The learning curve is particularly steep in respect of crop plant releases. Scrutiny of such releases at appropriate stages—for example, the transition from small to large scale trials—allows the development of GMO plant products to be informed by the benefit of experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two main arguments for wanting to ensure that any environmental and human health and safety risks associated with GMOs are appropriately assessed and controlled. The first is to prevent or minimise any risks being realised in the form of actual harm, damage, injury, infection, or deleterious incidents. The second is to encourage confidence in the technology, so that its genuine benefits will be recognised and passed on in the form of useful traded products and applications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing would stop the benefits of genetic manipulation more dead in their tracks than public perception that it was not properly regulated but was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0311">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
being operated by a bunch of cowboys. That impression would be wrong. The regulations will achieve complete public confidence and build on existing regulations, to which the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury rightly paid tribute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulator has to balance the risks against the potential benefits of the emerging technology, to ensure that the safety controls are sufficiently precautionary to prevent the realisation of any risks, yet are not so inflexible as to inhibit innovation and industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation of work using GMOs has taken a responsible, precautionary, and flexible approach from the outset. The voluntary controls introduced after the 1975 Ashby report were largely at the prompting of the scientific community itself. A successful and respected system of statutory control operated by the Health and Safety Executive has been in operation since 1978. That is one reason genetic modification in the United Kingdom is today a safe and flourishing technology.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister rightly alluded to the need to balance potential benefit against potential risk but added that there was a need to eliminate any risk. Did he mean that? The guidance notes imply that the risk should merely be as low as possible—not completely eliminated. How low is as low as possible? Do the Government intend that to mean no perceived risk, or are they prepared to accept some degree of risk? If so, how much?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that we need to ensure that safety controls are sufficiently precautionary to prevent the realisation of any risks. Surely, no one believes that one can deal with any technology—or even cross the road—without risk. Risk exists, but we aim to prevent it from being realised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The risks to those working with genetically modified organisms in contained use must be assessed and BATNEEC will be applied to it. However, we do not want that risk to be realised—that is, materialised into the atmosphere. For materials that are to be marketed and traded and are not in the contained use regulations, we must ensure that when the product is taken into the marketplace or released into the atmosphere, it is as safe as we believe that it can be. That is why there are expert committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about BATNEEC. This case is no different from all others. BATNEEC is applied as low as is reasonably practicable, or by the best practicable means. Risk must be. assessed in GMOs on a case-by-case basis. We intend to give guidance on environmental risk, which is being assessed now. ACRE's advice on the risk in each case will be taken into account and the criteria will be published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel strongly that in all areas of the environment there must be good risk assessment systems that are
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
clearly understood, but not so complex that they are impossible to comply with, and that more time should be spent on risk-assessment criteria than on developing a safe product.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The set of present regulations are a development of, rather than a radical departure from that approach developed over the past few years. They seek to take forward responsible and appropriate regulation, which would come to an end if they were annulled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Genetically Modified Organisms (Continued Use) Regulations 1992 implement in Great Britain the environmental and human health and safety requirements of council directive 90/219/EEC on the contained use of genetically modified micro-organisms. They also make provision in respect of human health and safety in relation to operations with "larger" organisms such as plants and animals. Organisms are grouped according to their hazardous properties and activities are classified on the basis of the type of operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A graduated system of controls, involving requirements for risk assessment, notification or consent, as appropriate, is applied. The higher the risk, the greater the level of control applied. Provision is also made, for the first time, for public registers of information about GMOs maintained by the Health and Safety Executive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Genetically Modified Organisms (Deliberate Release) Regulations 1992, together with part VI of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, give effect to Council directive 90/220/EEC on the deliberate release into the environment of all GMOs—both micro-organisms and larger organisms. As experience to date with the release of GMOs is limited, those measures provide that, with certain well-defined exceptions, all proposals to release GMOs experimentally or to market them in or as products require the consent of the Secretary of State for the Environment. They also make provision in relation to the public registers of information which are required to be kept by the Secretary of State under part VI of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this point, it is appropriate to make reference to a further set of regulations not mentioned in the motion before us—the Genetically Modified Organisms (Deliberate Release) Regulations 1993, which correct a minor drafting defect in the 1992 regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The picture is completed by the Genetically Modified Organisms (Contained Use) Regulations 1993. They are mainly technical regulations, which are necessary because, for reasons of vires, the contained use regulations cannot cover the environmental protection implications of "larger" GMOs, such as plants and animals. Their effect is to require environmental risk assessments to be made in respect of such organisms under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and for appropriate records to be kept 10 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0312">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
Before turning to the specific points raised by the hon. Gentleman, I will emphasise three points that demonstrate how all the regulations represent a balanced and reasonable extension of legislation to date in this area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the regulations implement Community obligations—admittedly rather late, but in advance of most of our partners, who are having difficulty drafting regulations. One of the most important measures for building confidence in the fruits of genetic modification is to operate clear and widely agreed safety procedures. The regulations contribute significantly in that respect by providing for a single Community market for GMO-based products as well as for commonly agreed measures and procedures for all GMO work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the regulations secure specific environmental protection requirements for GMO operations. Although the previous regime was administered in a way that allowed environmental considerations to be taken into account, it was based only on health and safety legislation—principally, the Genetic Manipulation Regulations 1989. Particularly to reflect the increasing number of proposals for deliberate releases of GMOs, part VI of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 made specific provision for protection of the environment against the possible risk from GMOs. In addition to human health provisions, the regulations introduce, for the first time, detailed and specific environmental requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the regulations seek to build public confidence in the technology by providing for the dissemination of appropriate information via registers. I stress the word "appropriate". We took great pains, in consultations on the regulations, to attempt to balance the various issues at stake. Although there is room for argument about the details, we have acted on reasonable principles, to ensure that any information provided is comprehensible and sufficiently detailed to make clear what is proposed and how risks are evaluated—without compromising legitimate commercial interests, such as the need to protect patent rights and genuine trade secrets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury spent much of his speech discussing registers and the need to inform the public. Before pressing for more information to be entered on the registers, he should reflect on their purpose, which is to be informative so that people know what is going on. They cannot be informative if they are not easily comprehensible to everyone with an interest and not just to the specialist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, they will contain essential details, including GMO risk assessment. The specialist or anyone else with an interest can obtain further information by asking the applicant or notifier, or using the provisions of the Environmental Information Regulations 1992. Provided that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
information requested is not confidential for commercial or other reasons, it will be given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister partly answered my question. Will the applicant—the proposer—be required to provide the information requested? I understand from the Minister's comments that the answer is yes, subject to the commercial confidentiality criterion—which is the primary issue of concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The EC directive places a specific obligation on states implementing the regulations to ensure that commercial confidentiality and intellectual property rights are protected. Article 19 of directive 90/220/EEC states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the competent authorities shall not divulge to third parties any confidential information … and shall protect intellectual property rights".</p></blockquote>
It would be wrong to give the impression that the EC directive states that all information must be revealed to everyone under the sun without restraint, or that the Government decided to interpret it differently and build in requirements covering commercial confidentiality and intellectual property rights. We have been faithful to the spirit of the directive and that we have got the regulations right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury pointed out differences between the registers. Of course they are different—they cover different circumstances. One deals with contained use GMOs, while the other covers deliberate release. There is no reason why they should be the same. They contain information appropriate to the work being undertaken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By definition, the environmental effects of contained use are accidental. Contained use operations usually relate to the earliest stages of research, when the commercial potential of the work is unclear. More broadly based protection for intellectual property rights is justified at that stage. However, once a patent has been granted, the relevant information will, in any case, enter the public domain. If research leads to an experimental release of a GMO, or to the development of a marketable product, further information will be available through the deliberate release register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury said that the period of consent is not defined in the regulations. That was done deliberately, so that the term can be determined as appropriate for each case. If the term extends over a number of years, the consent is likely to stipulate that annual reports must be submitted to the Secretary of State for the Environment. That will allow consents to be varied, if necessary. All consent holders are subject to a general duty requiring a releaser to keep himself informed about possible risk and to notify the Secretary of State immediately if the risks are more serious than when consent was granted. Anyone failing to comply with that duty will have committed an offence.

	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
The Polkinghorne committee was established by my right hon. Friend the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Its chairman is the Rev. John Polkinghorne, who is president of the Queens' college, Cambridge. The committee, which includes representatives from the scientific, ethical, consumer and retail sectors, expects to issue a report within the year, and it is examining areas that may give rise to ethical problems. The committee's primary concern is food use—it is not overseeing the whole spectrum of genetic manipulation in the scientific community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The committee is examining four aspects. They are the transfer of human genes to food animals; the transfer of genes from animals whose flesh is forbidden to certain religious groups to animals that they normally eat—an investigation that is specific to the question of food for religious minorities; the introduction of animal genes into food crops which may be of concern to vegans and vegetarians; and the use in animal feed of organisms containing human genes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Polkinghorne committee is examining ethical as well as scientific matters arising from the implications for minority religious communities of the use of GMOs in food, why does it have no representatives of the faiths most likely to be affected?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Quite simply, because that is not the committee's sole purpose. If it were investigating only the implications for food for religious minorities, my right hon. Friend the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food would have appointed more representatives from those faiths. The committee's task is to examine the implications for the food that is consumed by the vast majority of the population. The religious minorities are not alone in their anxiety about genetic manipulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, the committee issued letters to all interested parties. I am sure that it will receive responses from religious minorities about food. The composition of the committee is the responsibility of my right hon. Friend the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. If the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury is worried about the balance of the committee's membership—I do not believe that there is an imbalance—he must raise that matter with my right hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very concerned. Of course, that aspect may not be the committee's sole preoccupation, but it will be an important element in its deliberations. It is all very well for the Minister to say that there will be consultation and that representations can be made, but minority faiths must be confident that their anxieties will be properly represented to the committee. I hope that the Minister will agree at least to take the matter up with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, to see whether additional members can be appointed to the committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That matter is ultimately for my right hon. Friend, but when the committee was formed, I was completely confident that it was properly structured and balanced. The fact that it is chaired by a minister of religion shows the importance that my right hon. Friend attaches to the morality and ethics of genetic manipulation as it affects food.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No committee can represent all interest groups. Many others apart from religious minorities would want to serve on the committee, but I am absolutely confident that it is properly structured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury asked about products for export. Any product must have a consent under the deliberate release regulations. Products exported to an EC country will be covered by the same EC legislation as Britain. Product development will be covered by the contained use directive. If it becomes a marketed product, it will be caught by the deliberate release regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elliot Morley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glanford and Scunthorpe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister explained that development is covered by the contained use regulations and that marketed products are covered by clear EC release procedures. There is no problem with that. However, if products are exported to the developing world, would the same release requirements—the monitoring, reports, and so on—apply?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that any GMO development in EC countries is covered by the contained use regulations. If that research results in a marketed product, all the requirements of the deliberate release regulations would apply. I suspect that it would be impossible to enforce those regulations to cover further work by other countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask the Minister to reconsider that point, as it appears that exports of enhanced yield additives for milk will be permitted under the contained use regulations alone. The Minister and his right hon. Friend the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food should be aware of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall draw my right hon. Friend's attention to the hon. Gentleman's remarks, but I assure the Committee that all products are covered—not only those for release within the EC. Although it may attempt this sometimes, the EC cannot extend its competence to countries outside its orbit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury asked about an annual report. Like most independent committees, the Polkinghorne committee intends to publish an annual report, and is working on it now. The hon. Gentleman asked also about resources. We realise they must match demand. As more applications for GMOs are made, we will have to ensure that the resources are adequate. However, as applications are covered by fees and there is cost recovery, I expect no difficulty in ensuring that resources are adequate to deal with the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0314">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
applications, as companies will be paying for their own inspection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of patent rights is important, and it may have to be settled in wider international discussions as well as in the EC. The Americans were worried about it in the biodiversity deliberations in Rio de Janeiro. They were reluctant to sign up to biodiversity because they were worried about intellectual property rights and plant patent rights. We cannot reach conclusions unilaterally or in Committee. An EC directive about patent rights is being considered. That issue is important, but should not be included in the regulations. By introducing the regulations, the Government have genuinely tried to maintain a reasonable balance between the competing and often contradictory issues that affect new and fast-moving technology, such as GMOs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time, we have clearly signalled our intention to keep the whole process of regulation under review. The first priority is to achieve environmental and human health and safety protection by implementing the EC directives, which will bring further advantages through the harmonisation of rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second anniversary report on the 1990 White Paper "This Common Inheritance'' clearly mapped our path for the short to mid-term. It is to develop fast track clearance procedures for experimental releases and products when such actions are justified on health and safety grounds. We will look to the in-built flexibility of the directive and domestic legislation to agree simplified procedures for low-risk or no-risk releases, as well as to encourage the development of products that offer positive environmental benefits. For example, the use of harmful chemicals can sometimes be reduced by their replacement with GMOs. Regulation of contained uses, and the relaxations that may be justified on the grounds of experience and safety will be kept under similar review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any changes that are justified in relation to contained use or deliberate release will not be made at the expense of public confidence-building via the public registers and other measures for providing reasonable access to information. Overall, our objectives will remain to ensure that, based on experience, regulation continues to keep pace with technical progress and innovation, and that the public are adequately informed and thus reassured.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.32 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carmarthen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confess that I do not possess the same expertise and have not undertaken the same amount of research as my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury, the Minister, or my hon. Friend the Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley). However, I am interested in environmental issues and I have a good knowledge of anything that has a chemical or physical nature. I have no expertise in a subject that is as microbiological as genetically
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
modified organisms, but I am worried about what could go wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he was relieved and pleased that the Labour party would not vote against the statutory instruments. We support the regulations, but we believe that they should be stronger. During consideration of the Environmental Protection Bill in 1990, we supported its provisions but believed that they did not go far enough. This morning, the Committee has heard that the regulations are a dilution of EC directives, so I am worried about the registers for which the Environmental Protection Act 1990 provides. I remember our debates about them when we considered that measure. My hon. Friends the Members for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) and for Glanford and Scunthorpe made excellent contributions. They put pressure on the Government about the content of the registers. I remember the quandary about commercial confidentiality. Under that heading, industry could get away with not releasing all kinds of information to the public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not normally interrupt, but the hon. Gentleman suggested that we had diluted the directive in the regulations. I reject that view. If a country does not properly implement a directive, it gets taken to the European Court. What advantage does the hon. Gentleman think that there would be to the Government in being taken to the European Court and suffering the resulting opprobrium, including the Opposition's cat calls? Why should we deliberately dilute regulations to get taken into court and get into trouble?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going to make that very point to the Minister later, when talking about the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981—the transfer of undertakings, from the public sector to competitive tendering in local authorities. In 1977, we found that when the acquired rights directive from the European Community was incorporated into our directive, it applied to the private sector only and was not to apply to the public sector. My county council—Dyfed county council—and the National Union of Public Employees now find that the regulations apply to the public sector, which undermines the basis of competitive tendering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the EC directives are incorporated into British law, there is a danger of dilution. I am concerned about the exclusions in regulation 15(2) and 15(4) of the contained use measure. On grounds of confidentiality, industry and companies will be allowed to withhold information that should be available for public scrutiny. The population—our watchdogs, both voluntary and otherwise—have a right to such access. The cautionary principle should dictate that independent watchdogs should be allowed as much information as possible. As my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury remarked, the directive sets that out. Public interest must override a company's interest in having access to information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0315">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
Reports on risk assessment were to be made every three months, but the regulations stipulate that they will be made every five to 10 years over the development quota. Releases of genetically modified organisms may occur every three months for the first year and then annually thereafter, so the regulations should be much tighter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall mention four or five articles on genetically modified organisms from the past couple of years. I started to become interested in the subject at the time of the Environmental Protection Bill. Greenpeace's article has one of its typical headings,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Genetic engineering could lead to disaster".</p></blockquote>
I am a member or Greenpeace—it has an excellent track record of giving information on the environment. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Once a genetically engineered organism is released (or escapes) from the laboratory into the natural world, we have no way of limiting its spread if the scientists' calculations are just slightly wrong, and no way of knowing how the foreign gene will react with others, nor with what effect."</p></blockquote>
I cite, in passing, the example of the rhododendron, which has multiplied especially in Snowdonia national park. In Australia, the introduction of rabbits devastated the landscape. Dutch elm disease was brought into the United Kingdom on imported timber and that disease, too, has devastated the landscape. When strange and unusual materials are introduced into a different environment, there is no way of predicting the consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall quote from three or four other articles in the responsible press. The Sunday Times published on 5 July 1992, an article headed
	<br><blockquote><p>"Donor pigs to be bred for human organ swaps".</p></blockquote>
The idea, which I find morally and ethically repulsive, is to breed pigs with parts of human genes so that they can become donors to provide hearts for transplant operations. Could that be referred to MAFF's ethics committee? Such cross-fertilisation of species should not be permitted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservative party, and especially the Chancellor of the Exchequer, have not been very happy with The Sunday Times in the past few weeks. Generally, I take that newspaper, The Observer and The Guardian to be reasonably reliable. Another article in The Sunday Times, on 15 March 1992, related how giant calves were bred in an experiment in Cambridge that went wrong:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Instead of weighing the usual 80 lbs, calves developed to 1 SO lbs or more in the womb and had to be delivered by Caesarean section."</p></blockquote>
The large majority of the population—anyone with a moral conscience—finds such gross experimentation on animals repulsive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another example of genetically engineered animals is the transgenic chicken with cow growth genes. It is
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
possible, in a laboratory, to transplant genes for rapid growth into chickens to further increase the productivity of factory farming. Consumers have not been consulted about such experiments, which they find repugnant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there may be some good results from genetic engineering. On 17 January 1992, The Guardian published an article headed
	<br><blockquote><p>"Gene therapy treatment to fight fatal diseases",</p></blockquote>
which cited work done on cystic fibrosis and other crippling illnesses. We would all support the medical application of genetic engineering in that way. Two years ago, on 13 May 1990, there was an article in 	<i>The Sunday Times</i> colour supplement which, although disturbing, was impressive. It was a long and detailed article on genetic engineering headlined
	<br><blockquote><p>"Why life will never be the same again".</p></blockquote>
It gave details of how the new technologies can help in heart attacks, diabetes and AIDS, and held out hope of theoretical advances in the medical application of genetic engineering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am no expert on the subject—merely an informed lay person who is concerned for the environment. Broadly, however, I support the medical application of the science, which can help to conquer disease and prevent genetic abnormality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the techniques are applied in agriculture, to plant breeding, and in industry, I ask myself whether we really need those technologies. The problem in European agriculture is over-production.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is straying from the subject matter of the instrument. I shall be grateful if he will return to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall conclude my remarks. Why are we developing those technologies when there is food over-production in Europe? They would take us further along the escalator of increasingly intensive food production. They have no application in the third world, which requires low-level technology and a solution to its economic problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that the statutory instruments dilute the EC directives. We require stronger legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I served on the Committee considering the Environmental Protection Bill, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Williams). It is a great advantage that some of us are taking a close interest in this specialised but important area, because it needs detailed examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Page 5 of the regulations on release refers to the Nature Conservancy Council for England. Is that meant to be English Nature? Moreover, there is no
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0316">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
mention of the Joint Nature Conservation Committee being notified of any potential releases. One of our objections to the breaking up of the Nature Conservancy Council was that that would lead to confusion. If a modified organism is released—such as a beetle, aphid or fly—bio-control should not be restricted to England, Scotland or Wales. A national overview is required. The Joint Nature Conservation Committee should be informed of any release, as well as the agencies for each of the three countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In these regulations, closed release refers to laboratory experiments. I read the definition of micro-organisms and noted that type BII micro-organisms could be released in a greenhouse for horticultural research. Will the Minister confirm that a company could argue that under the regulations for certain types of micro-organisms—even in the research and development stage—greenhouses would meet the criteria for closed release? The regulations on preventing escapes define that as minimum release, which includes filters and low technology security that would easily fit into greenhouses and other horticultural establishments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On enforcement, the regulations refer to civil proceedings. In extreme cases, researchers may ignore the regulations, and the Department may not be notified. Does the Minister think that recourse to civil proceedings is a suitable deterrent to prevent people from ignoring these thorough and properly laid down regulations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury touched on the problems of enforcement. The Health and Safety Executive and other organisations need resources to monitor the work undertaken and to ensure that no illegal experiments take place and that the EC directives and the regulations are not ignored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should consider the question of ethics, which my hon. Friend mentioned. The committee established under the auspices of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will not consider the ethics of animal welfare. The problem crosses departmental boundaries. Mice and sheep are used by the pharmaceutical industry. The issues that surround such genetically modified animals are relevant to the Department of the Environment, MAFF, the Home Office, and the Department of Trade and Industry.

When applications are made to patent modified animals, before the animal, and the uses for which it has been designed, are patented, a committee should discuss whether such animals—for example, animals that have no fur—can be reared and kept in humane conditions. Animal welfare is not covered adequately by the regulations or by any committee. That flaw should be tackled as soon as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond briefly to the points made by the hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
He asked whether 'a greenhouse might be considered a contained use site. That will depend on the circumstances, which are considered on a case-by-case basis. The regulations require a physical boundary. If the physical boundary of a site is adequate, it will be covered by the regulations. If it is not, the case will be regarded as a release.

Civil action is a useful weapon in the armoury for dealing with people who overstep the mark. Criminal prosecution may be desirable in some circumstances, but civil action will often be appropriate. If the damages are right, such action can be a salutory lesson to companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about animal welfare. The Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 is comprehensive, and covers all animals that are used in scientific research. It contains strong safeguards for animals. The Government have already established the Farm Animal Welfare Council, which examines all aspects of animal welfare. The chief veterinary officer and his staff are under an obligation to take action where there is any cruelty or detriment to animal welfare, however it is caused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I was modified into my current office, my right hon. Friend the Minister and I read in the press that scientists were designing chickens without feathers so that more could be squeezed into a cage, chickens with six legs to provide more drumsticks, and other rubbish. Some Opposition Members quoted that rubbish. My right hon. Friend and I gave the clear instruction that we would not tolerate, in any circumstances, a genetic modification or development of animals, even if it might be beneficial, if it meant a diminution in animal welfare. FAWC looks out for that.

The hon. Gentleman asked whether we had wrongly called English Nature the Nature Conservancy Council in the regulations. We did not. The organisation may have chosen English Nature as its public relations name—and it is a good public relations name—but its technical statutory name remains the Nature Conservancy Council. The hon. Gentleman's point about the JNCC is not valid. That body gives advice on international matters, especially the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. It is not the appropriate body for consultation in these circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understood that the JNCC takes an international as well as a national overview. My point is valid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but the JNCC is composed of representatives of nature conservation agencies. It is a co-ordinating committee, whose specific functions are bestowed by section 133 of part VII of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.I shall write to the hon. Gentleman on the specific matter of the JNCC, but I am content that the Nature Conservancy Council is the appropriate body in this regard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.55 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We made some progress this morning, if not very much. The Minister gave a commitment that there will be adequate resources for inspection and monitoring, that ACRE will publish an annual report and that ACRE will publish the criteria for risk assessment. All those commitments are welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were told also that where consent is given for deliberate release and there is changing technology in the product, that consent is likely to set out annual reporting requirements on the applicant. That too is welcome, although I should have preferred a proper requirement for annual reporting procedures, rather than a likelihood. However, the likelihood is better than nothing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We remain disturbed on one or two other points. First, there is no earthly reason why, even if one accepts the Government's reasoning about commercial confidentiality, a company's arguments as to why confidentiality should apply cannot be included in the public register. The Government should reconsider that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Government made a commitment during the passage of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 to encourage international co-operation and decisions on the export of GMOs. They said that they would seek to establish agreed international controls. What happened about that? We heard nothing more. The regulations do not refer to that proposal, but it would be useful if the Government would explain what is happening with the international provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the Government have not answered our questions about ethical supervision. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has an ethics committee examining matters relating to food. We
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
have expressed our criticisms of that committee, but genetic engineering and genetic modification raise other ethical issues that are not subject to overview by an ethical committee. The Government should seek to put that right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe said, we do not intend to vote against the regulations. Regulations are needed and these go a long way towards fulfilling our aims. However, the Government have not gone far enough. They have fallen down on a number of points. As they review all the procedures over the next months and years, we hope that they will consider our observations this morning as to how the system of regulation can be improved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
