Fishing Vessels (Safety Improvements) (Grants) Scheme 1993 (S.I., 1993, No. 1325)</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must advise the Committee that I shall vigorously operate Standing Order No. 101, which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Any Member, not being a Member of the Standing Committee, may take part in the deliberations of the Committee, but shall not vote or make any motion or be counted in the quorum."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Michael Jack)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Fishing Vessels (Safety Improvements) (Grants) Scheme 1993 (S.I., 1993, No. 1325)</p></blockquote>
I am delighted to be under your chairmanship, Dr. Blackburn, for my first parliamentary outing on fishery matters since I joined the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.<br><br>
I should like to say at the outset that there are, of course, wider fishing issues, which are, I know, still the subject of lively discussion throughout the industry. The new Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and I have made it clear that we shall listen very carefully to the views of all concerned. To that end, I shall, for example, be going to Brixham tomorrow to meet fishermen where, no doubt, they will be talking about the order, as well as other matters.<br><br>
The order is about vessel safety. I would at the outset acknowledge that fishing is a hazardous occupation. Indeed, that is not surprising when one considers the uniquely difficult and sometimes unpredictable working conditions in which vessels have to operate. That is why I am glad to introduce the order because, over the next three years, we anticipate spending nearly £4 million on the safety grants, together with just over £1 million on residual grant payments for vessel modernisation.<br><br>
I am conscious that, since the end of the last scheme, work on vessel safety has continued and I would like to reassure members of the Committee that we have made provision in this order to pay grant to those who carried out eligible works since the last scheme expired at the end of 1991. The Sea Fish Industry Authority, whom the Government pay to administer the scheme, has received some 400 applications for grant, which it has held back pending the laying of this order. I understand that the authority hopes to process all those applications by the end of June. Furthermore, any one who carried out such works since the last scheme expired but who did not submit an application for grant can apply retrospectively, provided the application reaches the Sea Fish Industry Authority by the end of this month.<br><br>
The scheme we have brought forward provides grants for equipment which is necessary in order to obtain a Department of Transport safety certificate under the Fishing Vessel (Safety Provisions) Rules 1975. The 1975 rules, as amended, have formed the keystone of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
Department of Transport fishing vessel safety policy for the past 18 years. The rules set out detailed requirements for the construction, equipment and operation of United Kingdom fishing vessels with a registered length of 12 metres and over and provided for the four-yearly survey and certification of such vessels.<br><br>
As under the previous scheme—the Fishing Vessel (Acquisition and Improvement) (Grants) (Amendment) Scheme 1990—grant will be linked to the requirements of the Department of Transport safety certificate for boats of 12 metres and over. Without that, such vessels would be unable to go to sea. Grant rates will also remain unchanged. Vessels between 12 metres and 33 metres will qualify for aid at 30 per cent, while vessels over 33 metres will receive 10 per cent. Eligible works will, for example, cover the fitting of electronic position indicator beacons, which broadcast the location of a vessel to the search and rescue authorities if the vessel were to get into serious trouble. Other items that can be included are life-rafts, hand-held VHF radios, flares, rockets and life-jackets, plus any other works which Department of Transport surveyors consider necessary for a safety certificate to be issued.<br><br>
The safety improvement grant scheme will provide aid for essential safety works until the end of 1996. It shows our commitment to facilitate safe operating conditions for the industry and I commend it to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>4.34 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Norman A. Godman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Port Glasgow)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's transfer from the Department of Social Security to his present important position. We previously met in Committee during the passage of the Child Support Bill and I am sure that the characteristic civilities that he expressed on those occasions will be in evidence again today.<br><br>
The Committee will be relieved to hear that I am not going to make a long speech, but before I begin I should like to put the record straight. One or two of my hon. Friends on the Opposition Benches may think that I have been promoted. As any fishermen would say, I am simply a fellow keeping his hand in. I promise that my promotion is only a temporary appointment.<br><br>
To some extent, I welcome the order. I have always been concerned for the safety of fishermen. Two members of my family were lost from fishing vessels. Along with the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie), I have the honour of being an honorary president of the Clyde Fisherman's Association. I remind the Committee that four members of the association lost their lives when their vessel was dragged down by the Royal Navy nuclear submarine, Trenchant, in the trench of Arran on 22 November 1990. Skipper James Russell was a good friend of mine and of the hon. Lady. There is still considerable concern about the need to maintain an adequate distance between the massive nuclear submarines, which come in and out of the firth of Clyde, and our small, vulnerable fishing vessels.<br><br>
The Committee might wonder what that issue has to do with safety provision, but it raises an important question. Would the provisions recommended by the sheriff at the fatal accident inquiry in Paisley be eligible for grant applications under the terms of the order? I am talking about small fishing vessels owned by share fishermen. If safety measures are required of fishermen to ensure that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0749">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
adequate warning signals are given to approaching submarines, safety instruments should be eligible for that grant.<br><br>
The fatal accident inquiry resulted in a court martial which, in my opinion and from my experience as a member of a fishing family, reprimanded the wrong officers. It is the captain of a vessel who is responsible for what happens when he is aboard. In that case, however, the men who were in training were punished. I have always thought that that was wrong.<br><br>
This matter is important because the United States Navy nuclear submarine, the Sturgeon, almost sank the fishing vessel Lupina in the Irish sea on 23rd September 1992. The United States Navy admitted responsibility for that near-tragic event through a press release but there is still considerable disquiet—as I am sure that the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute and my hon. Friend for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) will acknowledge—about keeping such submarines well away from fishing vessels in traditional fishing grounds.<br><br>
The Minister said that the industry is dangerous—he is absolutely right. The statistics for fatalities and serious injuries exceed those of even the mining industry. European Standing Committee A, which on Wednesday 24th February 1993 and at which the hon. Member for Derbyshire, South (Mrs. Currie) was present, heard the Minister for Roads and Traffic state, among other things:
<br><blockquote><p>"Statistics collected by the Department of Transport's marine accident investigation branch show that of a work force of about 22,500, 30 fishermen died and 128 were reported injured in 1990, and 32 died and 165 were reported injured in 1991. The provisional figures for 1992 show that 22 fishermen died and 142 were reported injured."—<i>[Official Report,</i> European Standing Committee A, 24th February 1993; Column 3.]</p></blockquote>
It goes without saying that there is complete agreement between all members of the Committee that we must reduce those terrible statistics. That is why I offer a qualified welcome to the Order.<br><br>
I want to ask a couple of questions which have been brought to my attention by Robert Allan who is the Chief Executive of the Scottish Fisherman's Federation and by Richard Banks of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations in England. Those gentlemen and I want to know why the order applies only to vessels of 12 metres or more between perpendiculars? That is a reasonable question given that licensing and Department of Transport safety requirements apply to all United Kingdom registered vessels. My hon. Friends from the west coast of Scotland and from the Western Isles will confirm—as is surely the case for the south coast of England—that many fisherman fish on vessels of less than 12 metres. Your own experience will tell you that, Dr. Blackburn.<br><br>
Fishermen who use static gear—our lobster and crab men—fish on vessels less than 12 metres long. Why should they be excluded? My hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles will acknowledge that the little Minch can be a dangerous sea to fish as can the approaches to Loch Ryan or to the Firth of Clyde. That must surely be the case for fishermen in the English Channel too. Why should those men on small vessels, whose work is just as dangerous as that carried out on a freezer trawler, for example, on the river Humber—and I speak with a little experience as my brother Leslie is a mate on such a trawler and is fishing off Greenland at the moment—be excluded from the measures?<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
I hope that Conservative Members are smiling in sympathy because there is an inadequacy in the order and I hope that the Minister will re-examine it in terms of all fishermen on small craft, especially those who use static gear. We often hear of such men working the boats alone or with a two-man crew being knocked over the side. The Minister must change the order. I also want to know whether the scheme can be extended to comply with regulations laid down under European Community hygiene regulations. There is a gap there, as there are gaps elsewhere.<br><br>
The statutory instrument refers directly to the Fishing Vessel (Safety Provisions) Rules 1975, which the Minister mentioned. Those regulations run to 150 pages—and so they should, because they must cover everything from the construction of the hull to life rafts and other emergency safety equipment. The Minister may not be familiar with those provisions in detail, but I am sure that he will familiarise himself soon. I refer to part III, which concerns rules for life-saving appliances. I have already asked whether fishermen could apply for grants to purchase provisions that were recommended by the sheriff principal of the fatal accident inquiry into the sinking of the multi-fishing vessel the Antares. I assume that when a skipper owner or trawler company wants to equip a vessel with the most advanced life-saving equipment—such as inflatable boats, life rafts and life buoys— he will be able to obtain a grant. However, why is the grant restricted or reduced for the owners of vessels that are longer than 33 metres.<br><br>
While I welcome the order, there are some gaps in it. Is the Minister confident that it is compatible with the requirements that are contained in EC draft directive 9284/92, which is concerned with the safety of fishing vessels and fishermen?<br><br>
The problem is that the responsibility for the safety of fishing vessels extends beyond the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to the Department of Transport. Inevitably, confusion may arise. However, I hope that I am in order to ask whether the order is compatible with that draft directive, because I notice that it was given ministerial approval at a Meeting of the EC Social Affairs Ministers at the end of May. It will take time to be implemented. It does not come into force until 1995 and then there is a severn-year implementation period. I should have thought that if an owner of a vessel is trying to ensure maximum safety for his' crew members—I only know of one female skipper in Scotland and so the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute will have to forgive me—and he takes his leave from the draft directive, will an application for safety equipment that is included in that directive entitle him to a grant under the provisions of the order?<br><br>
I remind the Minister that the draft directive specifies the carriage of immersion suits. The Minister, his officials and members of the Committee do not need to be reminded that most fishermen die from exposure due to immersion in very cold water. The draft directive aims to deal with that problem by requiring that all vessels that are longer than 18 metres should carry immersion suits. They are already part of every day life in our offshore oil and gas industries. No one is allowed aboard a helicopter that goes out to one of the rigs or platforms unless he wears such a suit.<br><br>
I shall give an example of the importance of immersion suits. During discussion of the Safety at Sea Act 1986, Albert McQuarrie, now Sir Albert, would not accept an amendment that I tabled. It would have led to the carriage
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0750">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
of immersion suits on fishing vessels that are 12 metres and longer. Seven years ago, a French vessel went down very quickly off Kildare. It was overwhelmed in severe weather. There was a force seven gale and steep seas. Out of a crew of 27, those on watch were able to don their survival suits. Thus, 12 men went overboard wearing immersion suits. The other lads did not have time to put on their suits. French fishing vessels are not allowed out of port unless every man has an immersion suit, but some lads were roused from their berths and went overboard in their underwear. They perished in minutes. The 12 men who wore flotation suits survived for three hours until a helicopter arrived from Lossiemouth. They suffered terrible shock and hypothermia, but they lived. Their comrades died.<br><br>
The Minister should discuss with his colleagues in the Department of Transport whether the 1975 rules can be amended vis-à-vis the draft directive to ensure the provision of immersion suits for our fishermen. I do not demand that fishermen wear them while they work on deck—the suits are too cumbersome. In some circumstances, as in the case of the Antares, the men would not have time to put on the suits. When I put one on and took it off it took a minute and a half, and that was when I was standing on a level deck. If a vessel is pitching in blackness, it would take longer.<br><br>
In the light of the draft directive, are Department of Transport ministers considering amending the 1975 rules to ensure that immersion suits are carried? I agree with the Minister about the need to enhance the safety of our vessels. Vessel construction, conversion of vessels for purposes of safety, shelter and decks should be improved.<br><br>
In 1993, it is time to ensure that vessels carry safety equipment, whatever some fishermen say about cost. I do not say that fishermen are tight, but I once wrote an article that described them as maritime Poujadistes. They do not like to spend money. Some are in straitened circumstances. It is time, however, to give our fishermen the protection of vital equipment. The fishermen of the other European Community maritime nations have such protection. If it is good enough for French fishermen, it should be good enough for our fishermen.<br><br>
I welcome the order, but it is seriously inadequate, especially given its exclusion of vessels that are under 12 metres I look forward to the Minister's reply.</span></p>
<p>4.34 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ray Michie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll and Bute)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I add my congratulations to the Minister on his new post. I especially welcome his assurance that he will talk and listen to the fishermen because as he knows, we have had huge problems in the past year in particular. I welcome the fact that he is to have good in-depth talks with them. I am sure that if he discusses with them the conservation measures and the tie-up schemes it will be possible to reach a solution that does not leave the Government and the fishing industry at loggerheads. That is not good for the Government or for the industry.<br><br>
I endorse the remarks of the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman) about concern that the regulations will not apply to vessels of less than 10 and 12 metres. That seems ridiculous because many such small vessels, such as family-owned vesels, fish, particularly in my area of the country. The regulations should apply to them.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
Similarly, I hope that if the EC requirements on hygiene— I do not know what they are, but perhaps the Minister will tell us—are onerous as regards cost, grants will be available to help fishermen meet them. I hope that we shall not be left in a similar predicament to that of the agricultural industry, in which slaughterhouses are closing all over the place simply because they cannot raise the money to reach the hygiene requirements set down in EC legislation.<br><br>
As the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow said, we are all concerned about the general safety of fishermen and fishing vessels. I welcome the fact that the Ministry of Defence has persuaded the Department of Transport to abandon its plan to reduce the system of safety broadcasts that had been negotiated with the Navy and fishermen, to let those fishermen know where submarines are. I hope that fishermen will be included in any further discussions.<br><br>
The Antares sailed from my constituency. The marine accident investigation branch report stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"Even if the life-raft had been sited in the position approved by the Surveyor, it is possible that it would not have floated free initially with the vessel capsizing to starboard."</p></blockquote>
I understand that that happened because there was no hydrostatic release unit. All that I am asking the Minister is whether the regulations would cover the installation of such a unit.<br><br>
Another safety measure that has been suggested for fishermen, particularly those who operate where submarines exercise, are pingers to be attached to their fishing nets. The Navy has conducted trials with such pingers on nets. Some fishermen are using them now. I hasten to add that they are certainly only an additional safety measure. When I last discussed the matter with fishermen, they wanted to know how on earth they would pay to have them attached to their nets.<br><br>
I should be grateful if the Minister could tell me whether the regulations will cover some of the matters that I have raised.</span></p>
<p>4.49 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nick Ainger <span class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I too congratulate the Minister on his appointment and my hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow on his elevation, however short lived that may be.<br><br>
I, too, represent a constituency with an important fishing industry and am shocked that the measure does not include vessels of under 12 metres. I did some research on the fatalities involved in accidents, using figures supplied by the marine accident investigation branch of the Department of Transport. Unfortunately, those figures go up only to 1991, but they remain very interesting. They show that more losses are incurred by vessels that are smaller than 12 metres than by those that are larger. The deaths recorded through capsizing are also more numerous in the smaller vessels. In 1989, 12 fishermen on vessels under 12 metres died, and 10 of those deaths were directly attributable to capsize. In 1990, 26 such fishermen died, 17 as a result of capsize, and in 1991,'there were 22 deaths, 12 of which were the direct result of capsize.<br><br>
It is obvious from the statistics that the really serious problem lies with vessels that are under 12 metres—the size that is not covered by the measure under discussion. That was brought home to me when I was reminded that the fishing vessel Inspire, operating out of Fishguard, went down in September 1988, when a capsize resulted from
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V010P0I0751">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
swamping. Two inquests were held and an open verdict was recorded. Three fishermen were killed but miraculously— and the word is not an exaggeration—one swam ashore after 12 hours in the water. However, the Inspire was a vessel of less than 12 metres.<br><br>
New regulations are being brought into force covering days at sea and licensing arrangements for vessels of under 10 metres, but I am worried that the same safety regulations do not apply to all vessels that are in direct competition in terms of licensing, fishing and days at sea. An element of discrimination appears to be creeping in for vessels that are 12 metres and under; the good skippers who want to fit out their vessels with the right safety equipment will not be able to get the necessary grant. Fishermen are in tight financial circumstances because of the days at sea regulations, and it is unfair and discriminatory that the skippers and owners of vessels under 12 metres should not be given the same entitlement to grant that is enjoyed by those who own or skipper larger vessels.<br><br>
Finally, I wish to mention clause 4 of the order. I am always careful when I speak about any clause 4, but in fact I think that in this case I should call it article 4. Perhaps the Minister has brought some old habits from the Department of Social Security with him, but article 4 implies that there will be some means-testing of the allocation of grants. I hope that the Minister will explain the implication that an individual's resources will be taken into account before a grant is made.</span></p>
<p>5.4 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Calcum Macdonald <span class='memberconstituency'>(Western Isles)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome the Minister to his responsibilities. However, for two reasons, I regret that the Committee has been called to meet at this time. One reason is that we cannot see the wonderful Greek galley manoeuvring on the Thames. I shall not prolong the proceedings so that hon. Members can go out and watch it.<br><br>
The second reason is that this Committee sitting was called at dreadfully short notice. That is shown by the submissions that I have received from the Scottish Fishermen's Federation and others, and by the submissions that I have not received from people who I am sure would have commented if they had been aware that we were meeting to discuss this instrument. I was informed only on Monday about the Committee.<br><br>
I commend the ingenuity of the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute for being able to undertake such sophisticated research in that short time. This is an important instrument and people whose livelihoods and safety depend on this matter have been given inadequate notice to allow them to make submissions. Will the Minister explain why we were given such short notice about this Committee?<br><br>
I appreciate that the Subfacts scheme is a matter for the Department of Transport and the Ministry of Defence, but I hope that the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is keeping an eye on the situation and a finger on the pulse, because the lives of fishermen will be at risk if the scheme is not implemented properly. There have been newspaper reports that the Secretary of State for Defence has been laying down the law to the Secretary of State for Transport on the matter. I welcome that because I think that the Ministry of Defence viewpoint is the correct one. Will the Minister tell us whether that issue has been resolved and whether we can look forward to an early implementation of the Subfacts scheme as it was originally planned?<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
I am convinced by the statistics quoted by my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Ainger) about the frequency of accidents involving boats under 12 metres. There has been a fantastic growth in the fleets under 12 metres and under 10 metres because of the development of the shellfish industry in the past decade. That is commendable and it brings much valuable income to people, especially to those developing new markets on the continent. Because it is a fairly recent and rapid growth, boats are carrying out tasks for which they were not best designed and best built. There have been instances of equipment being installed on boats that has not been previously tested for stability in certain kinds of sea or in certain operations. I am not at all surprised at the number of capasizes to which my hon. Friend referred, because I have the strong impression that many of these boats are made top heavy and are unstable for the sort of equipment that they carry.<br><br>
The years of experience to refine and develop the compatibility of equipment to boat and procedure available to the larger fishing fleet has been lacking for those smaller fleets. The Minister should assure us today that he will introduce a scheme that will apply to the under 12 metre fleet. In my constituency, about 200 boats have been licensed as a result of the Government's new requirement for under 10 metre boats to be licensed as well as registered. Two hundred boats is much bigger than the usual fleet, so it is a significant problem that needs to be tackled.<br><br>
We must look not only to immediate short-term improvements to safety by improving and modernising existing boats, but to long-term safety. A fleet that is getting older and more decrepit by the year does not enhance long-term safety. That is especially true on the west coast of Scotland. In my constituency, 90 per cent, of the fleet is more than 10 years old and urgently needs to be replaced. I understand that there are problems in that respect in conforming to the EC multi-annual guidance programme. Those problems must be tackled urgently.<br><br>
The Government now have a scheme that they believe will meet the programme's requirements, although we may object to parts of that scheme. They should, therefore, be able to tell the Commission that we should be let off the leash and be allowed to replace the parts of the fleet that are most decrepit, especially in sectors that are not fishing precious stocks. In the present Catch-22 situation, boats and fleets fishing for non-precious stocks get caught up in the blanket ban on the renewal and reconstruction of the British fishing fleet because of over-capacity in the precious stocks sector.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will say that the Government are actively considering a scheme that will allow the construction of some new vessels to begin the process of renewing the fleet, thereby enhancing the long-term safety of the fishing fleet and keeping alive the boat-building industry that is so important in many of our constituencies.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been an illuminating and immensely courteous debate. I knew that my education would be advanced by our discussion and I am grateful to hon. Members for adding their own special perspectives. Hon. Members spoke with passion and conviction in representing fishing constituencies. I value their kind words in welcoming me to my new post, which will be most

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
exacting as this is a complex subject. I shall do my best to listen and learn and I thank hon. Members for their contribution to that process.<br><br>
As to the timing of the debate, I agree with the hon. Member for Western Isles that, for someone getting up to speed on the issue, more time is always advisable. However, the usual channels determined the timing of the debate; I am but a humble servant who is here to transact the business. There are 400 outstanding applications and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not wish us to delay for a moment longer in paying those justifiable claims for the safety material.<br><br>
I shall do my best to answer the questions posed. Central to most queries was why the grant is limited to vessels of 12 metres and over. As a newcomer to the subject, I too, asked the same question. I was delighted with the reply: the Department of Transport accepted, in principle, that stricter safety requirements should be extended to vessels of 7 metres. The Department studied carefully a House of Lords Select Committee report of ship safety, which hon. Members will also have read. When I have further details of the Department's consideration, I can give an undertaking that we shall carefully consider the report's implications for the scope of the grant scheme.</span></p>
<p>5.13 pm</p>
<p><i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
<p>5.28 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming—</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A number of hon. Members had asked about the cut-off point for the regime and I hope that I have given them an idea of future improvements. To conclude on the point, it is interesting to note that there are variations in the length of vessels of other Community countries which qualify for comparable schemes. For example, in Denmark it is 15 metres, in France it is 9 metres and it is 15 metres in the Netherlands. I stated the view of the Department of Transport before our proceedings were interrupted and I hope that the Committee will find that comment helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister said that the current regulations can be treated retrospectively, will he consider the new 7 metres threshold, also retrospectively, if and when the new regulation is introduced?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will forgive me if I do not give an unequivocal undertaking. Consideration means precisely what it says. If a new regime is designed in the way that I described a moment ago, clearly it will have implications for vessel safety and the grants that we are discussing, and I shall consider it carefully. At present, the Department of Transport is considering the matter. We are reacting to its existing safety regulations, but I understand the hon. Gentleman's point.<br><br>
Several members of the Committee properly raised the difficult and sensitive subject of the relationship between fishing vessels and submarines, and the tragedies that have occurred as a result of the two vessels unfortunately colliding. They cited a number of examples. In the light of reports of such incidents, the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow asked about the type of safety equipment that could be available under the regulations. Under the present arrangements, the vessels in question are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
more than 12 metres long. To put the issue in a direct way, if the safety work is necessary to gain the Department of Transport's certificate the short answer must be yes, such equipment could be available under the regulations.<br><br>
I do not have with me a detailed text of the sheriff's recommendations, so I cannot give the hon. Gentleman an analysis of the subject. I shall examine the issue carefully to see if I can say anything further about it. Clearly, the matter is important and the hon. Gentleman made several other detailed safety suggestions. The problem that I have in dealing with some of them is the scope of the order. However, I undertake to discuss all those suggestions with the Department of Transport, which would be responsible for them. If they were to be translated into future requirements for vessel safety, we would consider their implications, given the scope of the order. As I cannot anticipate what the future may hold, I hope that my assurances will show the hon. Gentleman that we take seriously the matters to which he referred, and we shall look carefully at them.<br><br>
The hon. Members for Western Isles and for Argyll and Bute mentioned subfacts. We are hoping that the issue will be resolved, and I assure them that they have the support of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in trying to bring it to a proper conclusion. I am glad that it was raised in Committee because that underlined the importance of the need to obtain a successful result.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow referred to the compatibility of the order with the draft directive on health and safety on board fishing vessels. I think that he anticipated my saying that that is not yet incorporated in the safety regulations that we are debating. Perhaps it is a shade early to know exactly how the detail of that particular requirement will be applied to the United Kingdom.<br><br>
As with all new safety regimes, they will be considered by the Department of Transport. It is pertinent to say that such an issue can be considered within the wider programme on ship design and safety, which is same matter being considered in connection with the extension programme on vessels 7 metres in length. My earlier remarks about our looking at the result of that process might bring us a little closer on that issue. As someone who sails a dinghy, I understand the importance to safety at sea of wet suits and survival suits, The hon. Gentleman's remarks were not lost on me.<br><br>
Members of the Committee referred to various reports on problems at sea in connection with submarines. I hope that they realise that I coupled my earlier remarks on that subject. If detailed factors flow from such reports, the Department of Transport will review them, and they will be matters that we shall consider at a later stage.<br><br>
The hon. Members for Argyll and Bute and for Greenock and Port Glasgow mentioned hygiene requirements. Hygiene and safety do not he within the scope of the order, but I can reassure them that the terms of the scheme are not designed to be too onerous. The Department of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will bear their points in mind when they consider the practical aspects of the enforcement of the requirements and regulations.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
The hon. Member for Western Isles took us into slightly wider waters when he raised the issue of grant aid for the modernisation of vessels. He referred to the fact that many of his vessels were older and thus indirectly raised the issue of safety with regard to the age of vessels.<br><br>
The fact that the order refers to the existing fleet demonstrates the commitment to maintaining safety levels for that existing fleet. The hon. Member for Western Isles asked whether it was possible to obtain Community moneys to modernise the vessels. I say to the hon. Glentleman—as someone who understands the implications of the multi-annual quidance programme—that until we are seen to be fulfilling the full remit of that programme, which is what our present three-year programme is about, the Community will not pay grant on construction projects. While those projects concern safety issues in his view, they also have wider implications for the potential to expand the effort of the fishing fleet and affect matters relating to over-capacity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that it will be three years before the Government go back to the Commission and try to get the purse strings loosened for the purpose of fleet reconstruction? Does he anticipate going back to the Commission earlier than that—based on our track record—and trying to obtain money earlier?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. At the risk of being slightly unpopular, I would not want to mislead him. We have a three-year programme and a target. I cannot anticipate going back "mid-stream" to do what the hon. Gentleman suggested. The hon. Member for Pembroke raised the matter of clause 4, or, rather, article 4. He asked whether it implied some sort of means testing. The answer is no. That also deals with the matter of why the order distinguishes between vessels of more than and less than 33 metres in length. The point is to concentrate aid on those who are the owner-operators, where the need is greatest. The larger boats tend to be company boats. That is why the split exists. It should not be seen as means testing. I should also say to the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow that I consider the time that I spent in the Home Office as having been in a sea of tranquility. Clearly he did not notice that I did not come straight from the Department of Social Security to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.<br><br>
I commend the order to the Committee.</span></p>
