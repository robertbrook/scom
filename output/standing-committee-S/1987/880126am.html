	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 12, in page 1, line 15, at end insert "in Scotland".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 13, in page 1, line 17, after "housing", insert "in Scotland".</p>
	<p>No. 14, in page 1, line 19, after "housing", insert "in Scotland".</p>

	<p>No. 16, in page 2, line 10, at end, insert "in Scotland".</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether you can assist us, Mr. Martin, in the choice of Committee Rooms. At our last sitting, we were in Room 15. Today we are in Room 5. Scottish Members of Parliament lead a fairly peripatetic existence, and it would be useful if we could be certain in which Room we would sit. Otherwise, we have to travel up and down the Committee corridor every Tuesday and Thursday morning looking for our Committee. Will it be possible for you to make representations to the House authorities and see whether we can have our proceedings in one Committee Room, preferably at the other end of the Committee Coridor, rather than this end close to the House of Lords?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment gives us an opportunity to probe briefly the intentions of the Government about the scope of the activities of Scottish Homes. Some of us wondered what the Government were up to when we read clause 2(1), which allows the activities of Scottish Homes to extend beyond Scotland. I wondered whether it was a ploy to get round the Standing Order to enable the Government to bring English Members into the Committee, but we have now discovered that they have found another way round that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be told to what extent the Government envisage funds earmarked for housing in Scotland being used outside Scotland. It is an important detailed point, and I hope that the Minister will be able to satisfy us, in which case, we shall be able to dispose of the group of amendments fairly quickly.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
The amendments cover all the related functions in clause 1(2), the first of which deals with the provision of finance for housing. It is fair for us to ask that the provision of such finance be used for housing in Scotland and not for housing in the Isle of Man, Wales, France or anywhere else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second function relates to providing, improving, repairing and maintaining housing. We should be told whether the Government are thinking of Scottish Homes providing housing outside Scotland. The third function refers to the promotion of owner occupation. We shall debate presently to what extent it is necessary for a body to promote owner occupation when plenty of private bodies are doing so already. It is one thing for a publicly funded body to promote owner occupation in Scotland, but it is another for such a body, funded by the Scottish Office, to promote owner occupation in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, or anywhere else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and Kinross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or France.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn). I welcome him to our proceedings. I assure him that he missed a treat last week. We look forward to his treats to us in the coming weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would take less exception to Scottish Homes assisting with housing in France, as opposed to England or Wales. At least there is an affinity or an alliance between Scotland and France which does not exist between Scotland and England. But I digress. The honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross must not provoke me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next function of Scottish Homes is to promote the provision and improvement of housing, promoting and assisting the development of housing associations, and developing the physical, social and recreational environment of housing in Scotland. We shall debate those functions in detail, but I hope that the Minister can assure us that Scottish Homes, funded by the Scottish Office, will use its money for the provision and improvement of housing for the people of Scotland and that it should not be diverted into any excursions outside Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may assist the Committee if I point out that the full notes on clauses are now available in the Room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) asked whether funds would be used outside Scotland. I assure him that they will not. The amendments are directed not only towards that end, but also towards the restriction of the operations of Scottish Homes and housing associations registered with it, to Scotland. I wholeheartedly agree with the thinking behind the amendments. However, the amendments are not necessary as a general restriction to Scotland on the extent of the provisions of the legislation, with specified exemptions, is set out in clause 67. Clause 1 is not included in those exemptions listed in clause 67(5), and its provisions affect Scotland only.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0107">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>49</span>
With that explanation and assurance, the honourable Gentleman may wish to withdraw his amendment, failing which I must ask the Committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may be able to withdraw the amendment in a minute or two, but first I should like to ask the Minister about the scope for Scottish registered housing associations to function outside Scotland. At present, no Scottish registered housing association has any housing stock outside Scotland, although there may in future be an argument for them to acquire such property in future. In that case, I assume that it will receive financial support from the Scottish Office and also support from the Department of the Environment for activities in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will the provisions affect housing associations which have housing stock in Scotland but are not registered in Scotland? British Legion housing association is one example that comes immediately to mind. Will such a housing association be able to take advantage of funding from Scottish Homes to support its activities in Scotland? It is a detailed point, but clarification will be useful at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can make it absolutely clear that the funds will not be used outside Scotland. I think that that is the basic concern of the honourable Member for East Lothian. Scottish Homes' funds will be used for individual housing association projects but it will not fund those outside Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Gentleman asked about housing associations registered outside Scotland which had property in Scotland. The activities of Scottish Homes will be related to housing activities exclusively within Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So it will be possible for Scottish Homes to provide funds for English-registered housing associations for development and other work in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Anyone acting in Scotland may seek help, but Scottish Homes would not deal with them as though they were registered housing associations in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that we may wish to return to that point later. A number of United Kingdom housing associations do useful work in Scotland. Similarly, I can envisage Scottish-registered housing associations doing work outside Scotland. There must be some scope for separate funding for activities on both sides of the border—
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<i>[Interruption]</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see that the Minister is getting some inspiration from his advisers. If he wishes to clear that point up now, I shall happily give way to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A Scottish housing association that had branches in both Scotland and In
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>50</span>
England could, for example, register separate organisations in the two countries, receiving funds from Scottish Homes for work done in Scotland and from the Housing Corporation for work done in England. I do not envisage any problems in that connection, and Scottish Homes' funds would be spent in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The principal assurance that I sought was that Scottish housing funds would be deployed only in Scotland. The Minister has given that clear-cut assurance. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 42, in page 1, line 15, at end insert 'for rent;'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to debate the following amendments: No. 43, in page 1, line 18, at end insert 'for rent;'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 6, in page 1, line 19, leave out from 'promoting' to end of line 20 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'the provision of good quality housing to let on fair terms and for owner-occupation.'</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 44, in page 1, line 20, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'and having particular regard to improving the provision of furnished and supported accommodation;'.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 49, in page 2, line 12, at end add:
	<br><blockquote><p>'(h) promoting and assisting in the provision, development and availability of rented housing for homeless people;'.</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendments is not to favour one form of tenure against another nor to promote the interests of the rented sector at the expense of other types of tenure. As the Shelter briefing says we seek to ensure that Scottish Homes promotes the provision and development of rented housing in Scotland. That is sadly missing from the Bill. We must tackle the crippling problems that currently affect those who are either unable to buy their own property or who cannot afford the high rents in the commercial rented sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 6 makes it clear that the Opposition are not opposed to the promotion of wider owner-occupancy, nor are we opposed to a greater choice of tenancy arrangements. We are trying to drive home the fact that there is more to tackling the housing crisis in Scotland than merely promoting ends such as those set out in the Bill. There is also a desparate need for the Government to tackle the growing problems that beset the public rented sector, housing as it does in Scotland about half of all households. It is the needs of those tenants that have been sadly neglected by the provisions—more accurately the lack of provisions—in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many housing bodies' organisations have responded to the consultative document, the White Paper and the Bill. For example, Shelter has drawn attention to the decline in the quality and quantity of houses available for rent in the public sector. That decline has occured at the same time as an increase in the demand for such houses, thereby creating a massive housing problem, compounded by a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0108">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>51</span>
Government investment record described housing experts as ludicrous and emasculating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux has warned against the Bill's failure to develop and provide a comprehensive housing service in Scotland. It has especially drawn attention to the persistence of long council house waiting lists and the Government's failure to give the required level of funding to solve Scotland's housing problems. Age Concern Scotland has said that it is deeply worried by the Bill's failure to deal with the quality of Scottish housing and what that will entail for those pensioners trapped by their reduced circumstances in inadequate housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So it goes on. Almost everyone connected with housing in Scotland except those responsible for the Government's policy has concluded that the Government have failed to tackle the housing crisis by directing investment to the public rented sector. Far from matching investment to the growing housing need and demand, the Government have cut expenditure on that major housing sector. That phenomenon was highlighted by my honourable Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) on Second Reading. He noted that the Government's contribution per public sector house had been slashed from £238 in 1979–80 to £52 in 1986–87. As my honourable Friend pointed out, that is leading to higher rents and to a squeeze on housing authorities' ability to provide quality management and maintenance services and a deterioration in the fabric of the housing stock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That point has been echoed by many others, including Professor Maclennan of Glasgow university centre for housing research. To prevent the Committee being tempted not to take him seriously, I stress that his name is Duncan Maclennan, not Bob Maclennan. He identified the under-investment in new building and rehabilitation programmes during the past 10 years as the single greatest factor in the current housing crisis. The Government are responsible for that. No one, except Government Ministers or the lackeys on the Tory Back Benches, would say that the professor was wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Shelter points to the growth in the public sector waiting list which has increased by 35 per cent. between 1981 and 1986. That is one of the prime indicators of the severity of the housing crisis. It also points to unacceptable overcrowding. More than 1.25 million Scots now live in overcrowded conditions. That is a quarter of Scotland's population. Such overcrowding has not been seen in other parts of the United Kingdom for the past 20 or 30 years, but it persists in Scotland to this day. All Governments should be worried about that who have a genuine concern for people's housing needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Shelter also points out the problem of pervasive dampness in Scotland's housing stock and to the serious health risks, especially for young children. A study carried out by Edinburgh university showed that bronchial symptoms, diarrhoea and general
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>52</span>
aches and pains were more often reported among children living in damp homes than among children who were not so disadvantaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Depressing as the picture is of the acute housing crisis, there is reason to believe that Shelter has under-estimated the extent of the problem. The appendix to the Shelter report shows that the Dundee district council waiting list doubled from 3,486 to 6,995 between 1981 and 1986. Yet last week I was told by Dundee's director of housing that the current waiting list was 17,000. Perhaps not all of those 17,000 people are in acute housing need or living in grossly overcrowded accommodation. But for one reason or another they are deeply unhappy and dissatisfied with their current housing to the extent that they are actively seeking to remedy the matter. Their only means is through the council waiting list.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no evidence in the Bill that Scottish Homes has been equipped or is capable of dealing with the real housing needs of those hundreds of thousands of Scottish tenants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the honourable Gentleman say how many empty local authority houses there are in Dundee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) shows his ignorance of the living conditions of people in Scottish cities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Galloway 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Hillhead)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He lives in a castle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If everyone had a castle, I would gladly agree. But many of those flats, not only in Dundee but in other Scottish cities, are empty because the councils have been denied the money with which to repair and modernise them. The Government are responsible for the deterioration in the housing stock, which has deteriorated to such an extent that people do not want to live there. They may not be overcrowded, but they have to endure poor living standards. Those 17,000 people on the waiting list desperately want what I and the honourable and learned Gentleman enjoy—decent living accommodation. They have been denied that by the Government, who have refused to furnish the councils with the money to provide it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman shows his natural prejudice. I bought by house, with its five acres, for £100 and did it up myself. It does not have a mains water supply, drainage, damp courses nor any of the comforts that the honourable Gentleman would expect for his constituents in Dundee. It just happens to be a castellated house which was built in the 13th century to keep out the neighbours. Will the honourable Gentleman stop talking nonsense?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the honourable and learned Gentleman chooses to live in such conditions, that is up to him. However, I am not arguing for 13th-century housing conditions for my constituents, and I hope that he will not, either.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend might like to remind the honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) of the Government's non-investment in housing. Will the honourable and learned Gentleman tell us how much he spent on his property, which was damp and required upgrading? We could then contrast that sum with the expenditure on housing in my constituency and the constituencies of other honourable Members, which, under the Government, has been woefully inadequate. Furthermore, when I chaired the housing committee in Edinburgh, I received complaints about that expenditure from constituents of the Minister and of the Secretary of State for Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the remarks of the honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross were eloquent testimony to the validity of the point made by my honourable Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is little short of insulting for the Government to argue that the problems of public sector tenants will be solved by an influx of private sector investment on the back of new tenancy arrangements. Such contracts will weaken the security of tenure for the tenants and undermine the principle of fair rent. It is offensive that the Government's remedy for unacceptable housing is to introduce new arrangements that will make tenancies less secure and ensure that tenants pay over the odds for new housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, the Secretary of State said that he hoped the new agency would make an important contribution to the rehabilitation of peripheral housing estates surrounding Scotland's major cities. If he was being genuine he should have equipped Scottish Homes with the powers and functions that would enable it to work alongside the district councils, as well as the private sector, to launch a major investment drive to modernise the housing stock and build new houses at rents that ordinary people could afford. It is a national disgrace that the Government have failed to introduce such provisions in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 49 deals with homelessness. No group of people with housing difficulties have been treated more shabbily under the legislation than the homeless. There can be no doubt among honourable Members about the growth of homlessness and the seriousness of the position in Scotland. Shelter has highlighted the unprecented rise in the number of Scots who are homeless, which has increased by almost 100 per cent. in four years. Even that organisation said that it was probably an under-estimation to ay that 31,000 individuals were in that position today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem of homelessness has suddenly become more serious. The records show that during 1978 and 1983, the number of homeless in Scotland remained relatively steady between 14,000 and 16,000. But in the four years since 1983, the number has doubled. That is a sure sign that the Government's housing policies are failing miserably,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>54</span>

However, I would be doing the honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) and the Committee a disservice if I did not back up my comments with some facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the honourable Gentleman knows my constituency well; he knows Blairgowrie, where the raspberry picking is a seasonal activity lasting for six weeks. A number of people come to Blairgowrie to pick raspberries. They remain in the area and claim that they are homeless; they are accommodated in caravan parks around Blairgowrie, and that is most unsatisfactory. They are listed as homeless, they come to see me about their problems, and I do what I can to help them. But I am not unaware that such homelessness is self-inflicted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman must not confuse the situation in Blairgowrie with the very serious problem of homelessness.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Someone who is homeless in Glasgow, or Dundee, is uncomforted by the fact that the total number of vacant council houses in the country as a whole is greater than the number of homeless. The fact is that homelessness has doubled during the period of office of the Conservative Government. Every homeless person is homeless—homelessness is indivisible, whether it is "self-inflicted", in the memorable words of the honourable Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker), or not. "Self-inflicted" is a strange word to use about people who have presumably got on their bikes and gone to Blairgowrie looking for work because they were unemployed in other parts of Scotland. They are then accused of having inflicted homelessness upon themselve and their families.

No one can deny that the number of homeless people in Scotland is rising sharply. Surely it is not asking too much to expect that an important housing Bill such as this would have tackled this major problem. Yet all we have had so far is the now infamous paragraph in the White Paper on housing that so contemptuously dismissed the real needs. The White Paper said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The problem of homelessness also needs to be set in the context of the Government's plans".</p></blockquote>
Surely it should be the other way round? The Government's plans should be set in the context of the needs of the homeless of Scotland. The paragraph continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Homelessness is a symptom of failure in the housing system."</p></blockquote>
It is also a symptom of the failure of those responsible for the housing system in Scotland and for bringing forward policies to ensure that the housing system meets the needs of people in Scotland—that is, the Government and their Back Bench supporters in this Committee. It is their responsibility and their failure, but the White Paper does not draw attention to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government's proposals will make the housing system work better."</p></blockquote>
If ever there was an example of the triumph of hope over experience, it lies in that sentence. I see no evidence in the Bill that the housing system will work better. The White Paper continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is important to address the problem in this way rather than through stopgap measures, specific to the homeless, which do not solve the underlying problem."</p></blockquote>
In other words, nothing will be done for the homeless by the Government or by the Bill. The paragraph ends:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The homeless will benefit from wider choice and a share in the general improvement in the supply and quality of housing as much as other sectors of the population."</p></blockquote>
What evidence is there that there will be any general improvement in the supply of quality housing which will really benefit the homeless in Scotland? Is growth in the private rented sector expected to open up new opportunities for the homeless? As Shelter has pointed out, experience of the private rented sector in Scotland shows a predominance of exploitation principally of young and single people, by landlords who charge excessive rents for appallingly low quality housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the encouragement of owner-occupation through the sale of council houses to sitting tenants expected to help the homeless? Again, Shelter points out that major losses in the rented sector
	<br><blockquote><p>"are in good quality public sector housing being sold and not replaced."</p></blockquote>
The key phrase is "not replaced". That brings me back to the lack of investment in the public sector which will make it incredibly more difficult to provide affordable and good quality housing for rent for the homeless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The truth cannot be disguised by the Government's propaganda about their success in encouraging the growth of home ownership. That growth has been brought about at the expense of those in the greatest housing need, and no

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>57</span>
Government should attempt to take credit for it. By all means, let us encourage home ownership and give sitting tenants the opportunity to buy their public sector rented houses, but it should not be done at the expense of those in acute housing need. Tragically, that has been the effect of the Government's housing policies for too long, and to their eternal discredit. The Bill does nothing to meet the needs of the homeless and it adds to the Government's shameful record of neglect. We are trying to focus on finding a solution to the problem of homeless people in Scotland. That is why we tabled the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) for speaking to the amendments in the light of his experience of his constituency. All Scottish Members should be able to relate to and understand such experiences. The great need in Scotland is for more houses for rent. The Government maintain that one of the great objectives of the legislation is to provide them, but they want the growth in such housing to be in the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have two doubts about that view. First, we doubt whether the private sector will respond—certainly its track record is appalling. Secondly, we fear that the only way in which the private sector might be likely to respond to such initiatives is by forcing down the standard and security of tenure and forcing up rents to such an extent that those who are in greatest need of rented housing will be put under even more pressure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a critical shortage of housing for rent in Scotland. My honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East spoke about his constituency, and the comments of the honourable Member for Tayside, North and his honourable and learned Friend the Member for Perth and Kinross illustrated the yawning gap that exists between the perceptions of this minority Administration and the Scottish Office and the people of Scotland in regard to the way in which these problems should be dealt with. Indeed, there appears to be dispute as to whether the problems exist at all. It was a bizarre comment when the honourable Member for Tayside, North said that the problems were the fault of those who encountered them. That is what he said about many cases and then he related a story about berry pickers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman is a farmer so he should know that berry picking involves some of the greatest numbers of labour. People come in great numbers to the constituency that I represent. I am referring to not hundreds but thousands of people, and if a substantial number of them remain in an area with a tiny population they can swamp it and create problems. The honourable Gentleman shakes his head, but if he will consult his honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion), who knows something about the Tayside region, he will be made aware of the enormous problems that the social work department of Tayside region has had to deal with for years that have resulted from those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>58</span>
A substantial proportion of the people who are recorded as being homeless in that part of my constituency is accounted for by those who stayed after the berry picking season ended and tried to make homes in that part of the world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us not get side tracked into berry picking. I know something of the Tayside region and that particular problem, and my wife comes from that area. If all the problems of homelessness and waiting lists for houses in Scotland are to be brushed aside because of local circumstances in Blairgowrie, heaven help the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In times gone by, when people took seasonal jobs in that neighbourhood, there would be chances of other seasonal jobs or the prospect of their return to their homes. However, in view of the "on your bike" society that the Government have generated, in which there is not only homelessness but hopelessness, it is not surprising that such problems should occur. We are discussing not seasonal workers in one part of Tayside region but a crisis that affects almost all parts of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A young man came to see me in my constituency surgery last Saturday who had visited me a year earlier to ask whether I could help him to get a house. He has been married for two years but because he cannot find a home he is still living with his parents and his wife and their baby are still living with her parents. As they are not physically homeless, because they have roofs over their heads, and because the local authority has other and worse cases to deal with, they are stuck in those conditions. Is it reasonable for society to accept that young people should start married life in such circumstances?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities in Scotland are not being allowed to provide the accommodation that is required by so many of our people. That is intolerable. One in 70 families becomes homeless each year; the number has doubled in the past four years. Last year, 31,000 families or individuals in Scotland applied for accommodation under the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977. That represents a major crisis and it is getting worse every year. Any responsible Government would be trying to deal with it, but nothing seems to be happening. Housing authorities in Scotland have waiting lists covering 200,000 people, although I realise that there will be some duplication in those lists, so it is not quite that simple. Later, we shall argue the case for a housing needs survey so that a proper scientific approach to the problem may be made, but there is no escaping the fact that many thousands of people in Scotland live in grossly overcrowded conditions. They occupy inadequate housing and far too many of them become homeless. It should be incumbent on any responsible Government to do something about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) was kind enough to visit the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>59</span>
Committee for the first time today, but he has now moved on. He said something about empty houses but conveniently omitted any reference to the fact that the majority of them are in the private sector. A high proportion of those empty private houses are in appalling condition and yet the Government intend to rely on the private sector to solve the crisis. The track record of the private sector has not been good in recent years and we do not share the Government's confidence that it will respond to the crying need for housing of so many of our people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 6 relates to the terminology of the clause which refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"promoting the wider ownership of housing by its occupants".</p></blockquote>
That terminology implies that the main objective is to get tenants of public sector houses to buy them. We see that as a rather distorted approach to the development of owner occupation. I re-emphasise a point that was made by my honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East. The Labour party remains committed to supporting and assisting owner occupation, but we believe that the most responsible way to go about that is to encourage its development in the private sector. People will be able to buy in the private sector without eroding the availability of homes to let in the public sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 6 calls for
	<br><blockquote><p>"the provision of good quality housing to let on fair terms and for owner-occupation".</p></blockquote>
I suggest that that would provide a more balanced approach to this aspect of the legislation. It includes specific reference to the development of home ownership—I believe that the Committee is generally agreed that we all want that—but it also recognises the urgent need to provide houses for letting on fair terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister cannot give away with this. There is no escape from the fact that the erosion of public sector rented housing stock in recent years has aggravated the problem. There has been a net loss of 46,000 council and SSHA houses since 1979. Inevitably, that loss means that the turnover of council houses for letting has been reduced, which contributes to the misery of those to whom my honourable Friend for Dundee, East and I have referred. Far too many of those young people trying to start families and careers in Scotland, who have to live in holiday houses, in-laws' front rooms, temporary accommoddation or low-quality private rented accommodation. That is no way to lay the foundations for the future of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A decent house is a fundamental human right, of which too many citizens are deprived as a result of the complacent and inappropriate policies pursued by the minority Administration in the Scottish Office. Part of the trouble is that the Government have so few elected Members of Parliament in Scotland and, unlike the Opposition, little opportunity to listen to the people of Scotland. The Conservatives represent only such places as Eastwood and parts of West Edinburgh, so it is not surprising that the Government are not hearing the real story. The 50 Labour Members and those Members from the alliance parties and the Scottish National Party who represent the majority of Scottish people return to their constituencies each weekend and discover what the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>60</span>
real world is like in Scotland and how people are suffering because they have no home. We are aware of the feeling of hopelessness that that creates.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond first to the honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) who raised the matter of resources. Indiscriminate subsidies, such as housing support grant, are not investments. The Government have made certain that indiscriminate subsidies are reduced to increase investment, which has risen by 14 per cent. in real terms since 1979. At the same time, properly targeted subsidies to individuals through housing benefit has gone up by 1,500 per cent. In 1987–88, in Scotland, it was £664 million, which is a considerable sum of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been an increase in the housing revenue account allocation of 17 per cent. in real terms since 1979—and, indeed an increase of the non-HRA—and, in the past three years, there has been an increase of over 80 per cent. in cash. Planned growth capital expenditure for this year is expected to rise from £720 million to £748 million—an increase of £28 million. Since 1979, the Government have enabled public sector housing agencies to invest £6 billion in Scottish housing. Something has been done, and we are extremely conscious of the problem of homelessness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Gentleman mentioned Professor Duncan Maclennan, who is a distinguished housing expert. He made it clear that he endorses the Government's attempts to improve the quality and quantity of housing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are the allocations to housing agencies. The vast proportion of the £6 billion went to the Housing Corporation. For the Scottish Special Housing Association, the sums, although considerable, were smaller. I need notice of the honourable Gentleman's question. Perhaps I shall be able to give him a clearer picture later in my speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The figures that matter are those that will be spent on housing.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am informed that the figure is 20 per cent., but I shall check that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Dundee, East referred to homelessness. Every council in Scotland has vacant housing which is immediately available, but people refuse to take it. That is an example of the problems of the management of public rented housing which the Bill will help. One of the successes in dealing with that problem has been Glasgow district council, which has been able to stop using bed and breakfast establishments by bringing more of its own houses back into use. I believe that others can and will follow that example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1985, the overall number of houses available for rent exceeded the number of households by about 128,000. We believe that the figure is about 130,000 today. We recognise that there are problems of mismatch in the housing stock and that houses may not be surplus in areas which people wish to live or work. There may be a mismatch between the number of family houses and the trend for smaller households. That suggests that local housing markets are not operating as efficiently as they should. Our proposals to reform the private rented sector will help to remove those market imperfections. Of the 130,000 houses, we estimate that slightly more than half are in the private rented sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for East Lothian referred to sales of council houses leading to longer waiting lists. We believe that the sale of council houses has had little or no effect on the prospects of those seeking houses. Research has shown that if tenants had not bought they would have continued to rent, so the houses would not have become available for reletting on a time scale relevant to present needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Housing waiting lists must be considered with caution. The Scottish Office will be undertaking research to determine the relationship between waiting lists and needs. If a person requires housing urgently, he may put his name on several waiting lists. If he is then rehoused, it is not always automatic that his name will be removed from all the lists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no dispute that the main concern of Scottish Homes will be housing for rent, nor that the homeless should be among the principal beneficiaries of its activities. We are as anxious about the plight of the homeless as the Opposition are, but there seems to be a difference of view as to whether we should treat the homeless as a separate group, as amendment No. 49 seeks to do. We believe that the homeless need the same wide choice of housing for rent as everyone else. Paragraph 1.17 of the White Paper states:
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>62</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Homelessness is a symptom of failures in the housing system. The Government's proposals will make the housing system work better. It is important to address the problem in this way rather than through stop-gap measures, specific to the homeless, which do not solve the underlying problem. The homeless will benefit from wider choice and a share in the general improvement of the supply and quality of housing as much as other sectors of the population."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am astonished that the Minister has not drawn a veil over that memorable paragraph in the Government's White Paper. To say that the crisis of homelessness can be concealed in a general, long-term approach to housing policy in Scotland beggars belief. The Minister has dismissed stop-gap measures. If a family is homeless and is forced to live in temporary, inadequate and over-crowded accommodation, that family needs a house now—not in the far blue never-never-land dreamed up by the Tory party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977 provides immediate protection for the homeless and guarantees housing for those most at risk, especially families with young children. The treatment of the homeless is up to local authorities. There are far more council houses available for reletting each year than there are homeless people. If half the 130,000 houses to which I referred are brought back into use, people accepting those houses will not be adding their names to housing waiting lists. That long-term solution will help local authorities to deal with immediate and urgent matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 49 is not about helping the homeless. It is merely window dressing and it contains nothing which clause 1(3) does not already provide. The amendments would stop Scottish Homes from doing anything other than promotional work to improve the position of those wishing to own their houses. That is a narrow approach. Scottish Homes must be able to assist people with their housing needs and preferences, irrespective of what form of tenure they choose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposals for the role of Scottish Homes in relation to those who own or wish to own their houses are referred to in paragraph 2.16 of the White Paper. That role will be important for those buying their homes and those who wish to form co-operatives. A restriction on Scottish Homes would be a considerable obstacle to its dealing with developments that are partly for rent and partly for ownership. We need more of those developments, rather than the divisive, single tenure approach that has been characteristic of past developments. Any obstacle to the approach that we envisage would be a retrograde step.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Doran 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The thrust of our amendments is to oblige Scottish Homes to concentrate on housing for rent. I listened to the Minister's glib comments on the White Paper which ignores homelessness. We cannot consider that matter on the basis of dogma or philosophy. The Minister referred to the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977. I was a member of a voluntary organisation which lobbied hard to produce that Act and I

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>63</span>
remember the struggle that we had. We saw that legislation as a positive and solid move to remove the scourge of homelessness from the United Kingdom, but that has not happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem has become worse, not because people choose homelessness but because housing is not available. Historically, local authorities have provided the main source of housing for rent in Scotland, but they find it difficult to provide new houses or to bring existing stocks to a decent standard. In Aberdeen, the figures show that homelessness has increased by a staggering 185 per cent. in the past four years, compared with a national increase of 94 per cent. Those figures are disgraceful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

There are special problems in the Aberdeen area due to economic pressures. There has been no shortage of house-building, but it has been in the private sector. The private sector cannot now dispose of the houses because there are insufficient people wanting to buy them. The pressure on housing in my constituency is at the lower end of the market and comes from people, such as young married couples and people with young families, who would normally rent housing from the council. At my surgery I regularly see young married couples who have to live with their parents. During the 1940s and 1950s my parents were forced to live with their parents until they could obtain a house. I was five years old before my parents had a house of their own. That is the position in Aberdeen now. Young married couples cannot obtain a house of their own. That is a shocking indictment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke of an increase in resources to local authorities. We are accustomed to Ministers trotting out figures and statistics in an attempt to cover up the real difficulties in services such as education, housing and, most notoriously, the Health Service. I had a meeting with the Minister last week to discuss the housing allocation for Aberdeen, which is to be cut by £1.25 million next year. He managed to find some extra money for us this year, for which we were very grateful, but next year the council will lose £1.25 million of its much-needed housing expenditure allocation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Shelter's figures show that more than 250,000 homes in Scotland need to be fully modernised. Another 250,000 require treatment for dampness and condensation. Large sections of housing schemes in my constituency require such treatment. That problem which is not unique to my constituency, needs urgent attention and will not be helped by the Bill or the Government.

The housing waiting lists in Scotland are appalling. It is too glib to say that there are more empty houses than people wishing to occupy them. We all know the standard of those houses. In Aberdeen city, 5,115 families and individuals are on the housing waiting list. That is a 62 per cent. increase between 1981 and 1986. If the Minister's figures were accurate, there would be an improvement in the housing situation, not an increase in waiting lists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>64</span>
The Minister said that approximately half the empty houses are in the private sector. We know that. I have had much experience of the private rented market, as I hope to describe to the Committee later. As a solicitor for many years, I have been involved in the buying and selling of property and in dealing with landlords and the problems of tenants. I know the condition of some of those properties. Empty tenements are used as a stop-gap for desperate people, but families will usually not occupy those properties because they do not have basic amenities. Much of that property is lying empty because landlords are waiting their turn in the queue while local authorities process their applications for improvement or repair grants. The properties are then removed from the private rented market and sold because the Government have removed restrictions on the right to sell when repair and improvement grants have been made. Such properties provide a great opportunity for speculation and a great deal of money is being made. Old, run-down tenements are used as stop-gap accommodation for desperate people who cannot find housing elsewhere and who are exploited intolerably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill does not cover that problem. I support the amendments tabled by my honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East to force the new Scottish Homes authority to concentrate on housing for rent because that is where the desperation and need is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to supplement some of the comments that have been made with some of the facts. The amendment focuses on the need for more adequate housing, especially more rented housing that people can afford. The rise in homelessness is staggering and has occurred in rural rather than urban areas. Regional councils that the Secretary of State would describe as prudent include the Borders regional council, which has not a Marxist on it. Homelessness in the Borders region rose between 1983 and 1987 by 124 per cent. The figure for Dumfries and Galloway region is similar at 104 per cent. In Grampian region the figure is 183 per cent. and in Central region it is more than 200 per cent. The prize goes to the Conservative district council of Eastwood which has seen homelessness rocket by more than 1,000 per cent. during those years. Those are the figures that the Government seek to duck.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The waiting lists of new town councils and the Scottish Special Housing Association provide a similarly gloomy picture as a result of the Goverment's wonderful housing policies during the past eight years. No wonder their consultative papers fall on stony ground. District councils that have no political axe to grind with the Government have seen the number of people on their waiting lists rocket. The waiting list has risen by 78 per cent. in Tweeddale, 117 per cent. in North-East Fife, 87 per cent. in Gordon, 138 per cent. in Eastwood, 133 per cent. in Sutherland and 132 per cent. in Caithness. With the exception of Eastwood, those are all rural areas and waiting lists have rocketed as a result of the Government's policies which have done nothing to help those who are either homeless or on waiting lists and require housing.

What is the Government's explanation? Apparently there is none. The Government do not like the figures, so they have commissioned a survey. I welcome any extension of knowledge and collection of information, and I wonder whether the Minister will tell the Committee when that survey will be published and presented. I also wonder whether he will assure the Committee that the survey will be extended to cover housing conditions, so that we know what needs to be done to houses. The Government have ducked that matter and have so far refused to provide any information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) spoke about the apparent surplus of housing and I am sorry that the baron is no longer in the Committee. If he were, perhaps he would explain why, if houses of a suitable type and size are available in the right places, 1.5 million Scots are living in overcrowded condtions. Surely they would not choose to do so if suitable accommodation were available. Why are 200,000 Scots prepared to remain on waiting lists and to live with relatives, friends or even strangers, if that mythical surplus of suitable housing exists? The reason why people are prepared to put with such conditions—horrific conditions in many cases—is that they do not want to be forced to take one of the 250,000 damp houses or one of the 250,000 unmodernised houses, without power points in some rooms and without sources of heating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's record of creating the climate for new private housing is sadly lamentable. The statistical bulletin of the Scottish Development Department published in November 1987 revealed that the number of houses completed in both the public and private sector decreased by 9 per cent., compared with the corresponding quarter in 1986. The private-sector figure fell by more than 6 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is there any light on the horizon? Comparing the long-term trends with the Labour Government's record, we see that the Labour Government built more than 15,000 private-sector houses while the Conservative Government could not match that figure even after seven years in office, and they are unlikely to achieve it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The gist of the amendement is to ensure that we provide a framework for suitable housing for rent at rents that people can afford. Evidence from the Government, Shelter and local councils shows that there are insufficient houses for rent, and our amendment seeks to redress that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood (Roxborough and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I broadly support the thrust of the amendments although it will be no surprise to Committee Members to hear that I do not wholly agree with the argument for the public-sector. Evidence shows that some authorities' public-sector policy has left much to be desired.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 seems to be antipathetic to the public sector and to militate against it. It puts the onus on the promotion of owner-occupation and private-sector tenancies. If the balance is wrong, it
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>66</span>
will be bad for Scotland as traditionally people have been happy and content with sensible accommodation to rent from local authorities. Some authorities have pursued exemplary policies, looking after the housing stock and providing a good service for their tenants. I fear that the Bill will upset the balance and militate agains local authorities, making their job much more difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If all the cream of the public-sector stock is put into owner-occupation, higher unit costs are inevitable as local authorites will be left with a declining and dilapidated housing stock to look after. Waiting lists will not be so much of a problem, and I listened carefully to the Minister's argument in that respect, but the condition of the stock will decline steeply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened carefully to the debate and I apologise to the honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) that I was a little late in arriving this morning. He may have dealt with this point, but I do not understand what he means in amendment No. 44 by asking the Government to improve
	<br><blockquote><p>"the provision of furnished accommodation".</p></blockquote>
I am not an expert in such matters and I do not have the experience of some Opposition Members in local authority housing. I do not know whether the Opposition propose to press the amendment to a Division, but I should find it helpful if the meaning of the amendment could be explained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures quoted by the Minister earlier were confusing. I am aware that we are not dealing with a financial measure, but the figures seem to cover the broad thrust of the Government's financial schemes over the next two or three years, as announced in the public expenditure White Paper. We anticipate commentary on that White Paper and once that commentary is produced, perhaps it could be explained what the figures represent. There is confusion about the balance of capital receipts and disposals. There are arguments about how that money will be used and whether it will go through agencies or the public sector. I hope that the Minister can give a statement of the Govenment's position on finance so that we can study it and refer to it at an appropriate stage in our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I shall deal with the point raised by the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood). The justification for giving the new agency a function with regard to furnished and supported accommodation is to improve the provision of furnished and supported rented accommodation so that the new agency can take into account the development of housing demand for single people on low incomes, which is one of the fastest growing areas of housing need. Single people on low income often need that kind of accommodation. We believe that the Scottish Homes agency should deal with the important problem and Shelter also holds a similar view. People on low incomes often cannot break into the council market or the commercial rented sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister began by drawing attention to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0116">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>67</span>
Government's intention not to get involved in indiscriminate subsidies. He said that the Government would concentrate resources on investment, but I challenge the extent to which the Government have concentrated resources on investment. If the Government genuinely believe that it is wrong to become involved in indiscriminate subsidies, why are they involved in just that in the private sector? Mortgage interest tax relief for owner-occupiers is worth £4,500 million. That is an indiscrimate subsidy and, unlike the Social Liberal Democrats, we are not opposed to that. We are opposed to giving to one sector and denying another. We are opposed to double standards and hypocrisy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend says that that is an indiscriminate subsidy. It is discriminatory as the high value of housing and the high concentration of owner-occupied housing in the south of England means that most of that mortgage interest tax relief is funnelled to the south-east at the expense of the rest of the country. Relatively little of that benefit goes to Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend makes a good point. That is one of the reasons why Conservatives do so well in the south and so poorly in the north, Wales and Scotland. If the Minister genuinely believes that he belongs to a party of the United Kingdom, he should tell his colleagues in the Cabinet that it is about time that the Government began to consider the needs of the people in Scotland as well as those of the people in the south-east.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that housing benefit will increase and that it will meet the needs of the poor. I challenge that. He knows that the Government are reviewing and reforming social security and that more than 1 million people will no longer receive housing benefit. How will they benefit from his promise that housing benefit will be made available to them? Moreover, under the Bill, rent officers will be able to scour people in rented accommodation to find out if property is over-accommodated. They will say that a single person living in a two-bedroomed property will not be entitled to housing benefit even if he has been there for the past 25 years. The Minister's comment about housing benefit does not hold any water.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The central point that the Minister tried to make was that the Government were increasing housing investment, especially the housing revenue account allocation. I draw his attention to a letter which was sent to him by the director of finance at Dundee district council. It goes to the heart of the question about whether housing investment is being increased by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I refer to your letter dated 18 December 1987. In 1987/88 the District Council received a gross capital allocation off 16.5 million … for the Housing Revenue Account, but in 1988/89 it is proposed to reduce this to £15.2 million … The condensation and dampness allowance has been reduced from £2.380 million to £0.940 million.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>As the housing crisis in Dundee continues to deteriorate the District Council is unable to understand the reasons for this reduction. I have, therefore, been instructed to write to you to ask for an explanation for the reduction in the 1988/89 Housing Revenue Account Capital Allocation."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>68</span>
The Government are reducing capital allocations to local authorities and it is nonsense for the Minister to claim otherwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to my honourable Friend the Member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram), the Minister said that the amount of the allocation made up of capital receipt is 20 per cent. However, in Dundee, 37 per cent. of the capital allocation of £16.5 million was made up of capital receipts. Almost half of Dundee's capital allocation will be made up of capital receipts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister described Professor Maclennan as a distinguished housing expert and said that he approved of the Government's attempts to improve the quality of housing. We do not dispute that. Everyone supports such attempts. However, I draw the Minister's attention to the remarks of Professor Maclennan and others about the Government's record on investment in housing. Lord Wheatley, president of the Scottish branch of International Year of Shelter for the Homeless, described it as "emasculating". I trust that the Minister also regards Lord Wheatley as a housing expert.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Shelter document states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Professor Duncan Maclennan of Glasgow University Centre for Housing Research is quoted as describing the restriction on capital spending as 'ludicrous' and identifying underinvestment in new building and rehabilitation programmes over the past ten years as the single greatest factor in Scottish housing. Two indicators of the decline in investment are firstly the amount of expenditure on housing within the Secretary of State's responsibility which has declined by 41 per cent. since 1978/79 in real terms. Secondly, Shelter has calculated that the cumulative loss in capital investment in local authority housing over the last ten years stands at more than £800 million."</p></blockquote>
The Minister must answer those challenges. The Government are not considering the central issue of the housing crisis, which is underinvestment in the housing stock, and nothing in the Bill suggests that they are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Minister is a nice man—I do not say that about many Conservative Members—he even had the affrontery to trot out Government nonsense. He said that the problem of homelessness and vacant houses under local authority control was because of management. It is not. Houses are vacant because local authorities have been starved of the necessary resources to bring them up to a proper standard of repair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the Minister's attention to Dundee district council which has taken initiatives of the highest calibre. Dunbar park had vacant property which the council could not let because of its poor condition, but the council has now turned it into attractive houses for sale at low cost to people who were on the waiting list. At present, the council are involved in a tremendous initiative in Ormiston to set up a Par Value co-op. Those initiatives have been taken in the public sector by local authorities in combination with the Housing Corporation and the Government. It is a wholly public-sector initiative and it has been most successful. That is the way forward for the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the sale of council houses had no effect on the homeless. That statement must be challenged. People who are on housing waiting
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0117">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>69</span>
lists are looking for decent housing. Much of the council stock is multi-storey or tenement accommodation which many families are not content to live in for the rest of their lives. They aspire to live in a semi or a cottage-type dwelling with a garden at the front and back, and why should they not? The policy of selling council houses means that the cottage-type dwellings are sold. That would be all right if the Government gave councils the money with which to replace that type of dwelling so that people still had an opportunity to live in such housing. There must be investment to enable councils to replace the stock that they have been obliged to sell under the Government's legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was complacent in quoting that infamous paragraph from the White Paper. It is to the Government's discredit that the paragraph was printed and published. My honourable Friend was right to say that it would have been far better if the Minister had drawn a veil over the paragraph instead of drawing attention to it. He used insulting and degrading words such as "window dressing" and "a narrow approach" because we are trying to focus attention on the needs of the homeless and those on waiting lists, and on the need to invest more in the housing stock of Scotland. It is impossible for us to withdraw the amendment. We shall pursue it to a Division because the Minister has forced us to do so by the disgraceful manner in which he has dealt with our arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, in relation to resources, the total capital investment in public-sector housing is up 14 per cent. in real terms since 1979. I remind honourable Gentlemen that it was down 37 per cent. between 1975 and 1978 under the Labour Government and that since 1970, 80 per cent. of council stock has been built or modernised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Honourable Gentlemen asked about research on waiting lists. The social survey and analysis will be carried out by October 1988. I assure the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) that Scottish Homes' main concern will be with rented housing. As we are aware, the private rented sector has shrunk to 6 per cent., which is far less that it used to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Accept the amenment then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give the reasons why I cannot accept the amendment in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, there are five or six times as many vacant houses in Scotland as there are homeless people. It is necessary to avoid mismatch in local authorities and to make more privately-owned houses available. I pay tribute to the Shelter rural housing initiative which the Scottish Office helped to fund. It is doing what it can to identify vacant houses in the countryside and, with the assistance of local authorities, to bring them back into habitation. We want that process to continue more quickly and on a larger scale throughout Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>70</span>
The honourable Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) alleged that the Government had failed to stimulate private rented housing. I remind him that on Second Reading, the honourable Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The idea that we should try to revive the private rented sector is, no doubt, laudable in itself."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 11 January 1988; Volume 125 chapter 59.]</p></blockquote>
The honourable Gentleman's approach was sensible and we are following it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) asked about the cause of the rise in homelessness. I cannot give him all the reasons, but when I was in his constituency during the summer, I asked why the figures had increased recently. I was told that there were a number of reasons, among which were the break-up of marriages, the increase in single-parent families, and young people leaving home at an early age. No doubt there are others which should be taken into account. I acknowledge that there is a genuine problem, but the amendments are not about priorities. I have said that Scottish Homes will concentrate on housing for rent. The amendments will prevent Scottish Homes from helping those interested in ownership.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Minister said that the amendments were not about priorities. Will he therefore confirm that the Government do not regard the needs of the homeless as a priority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I regard the needs of the homeless as a priority, but the amendments will not achieve that purpose.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 6 is a further example of an amendment that does not differ greatly from what is in the Bill, but insofar as it does, it introduces undesirable changes. The first effect of the amendment would be to restrict Scottish Homes to being concerned with the "provision" of housing whereas at present clause 1(3)(c) directs Scottish Homes' concern towards the way in which the housing is occupied. Scottish Homes' concern with provision is already covered to some extent by paragraphs (a) and (b) in subsection (3), and concern with promoting additional provision is embraced within the existing wording of paragraph (c). However, paragraph (c) is concerned with more than provision in the sense of making available housing which is not presently in use or requires to be built. It covers changes in the way in which people occupy their homes, for example from renting to ownership, and the terms on which people rent their homes. These, too, are important matters which should not be excluded from Scottish Homes' concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another narrowing effect of the amendment,
through the proposed incorporation of references to "owner-occupation" as distinct from the existing references to "wider ownership", is the exclusion of ownership arrangements which differ from conventional owner-occupation, namely co-operative ownership, which has already been successful in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>71</span>
The proposed introduction of a reference to letting "on fair terms" is unnecessary, since it cannot be in anyone's interests for Scottish Homes to set out to promote unfair renting arrangements, and undesirable since it introduces a purley subjective limitation of Scottish Homes' functions. However, it is interesting because it highlights a basic difference of approach between us and Opposition Members. We believe in promoting a better deal for the consumer by extending and expanding the choice available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Any by increasing the rent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly not. We shall discuss the safeguards later in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition believe in telling people what is good for them and using the public sector to restrict what is on offer rather than to expand it. I suggest that it is in the public interest that we let tenants decide what is fair and enable Scottish Homes to carry out the task of making tenants' power of decision more powerful by placing a wider choice before them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is peddling political solgans and dogma. There is nothing of substance in his allegation about our lack of concern about housing. If, as he said, the Government are promoting better housing and a better housing policy, why has homelessness doubled? Why have the numbers on waiting lists rocketed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I explained earlier, there are many reasons for homelessness. I mentioned the problems of young people leaving home earlier; the break-up of marriages; the increase in single-parent families. I know, because I piloted a Bill through the previous Parliament, that the number of children born to unmarried parents has unfortunately risen hugely in recent years. Those are pressing problems. If a girl who has recently had a baby or is about to give birth is homeless, priority will be given to her needs. There have been social and demographic changes recently and other factors which I am only too ready to accept, but each case must be considered on its merits, calmly and dispassionately. As I said, research on the waiting lists is important as all the reasons for homelessness must be established. There is no simple reason for the increase in homelessness as the honourable Gentleman suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister comment on the remarks of the honourable Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) that a considerable proportion of Scottish homelessness is self-inflicted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was not my understanding. I understood my honourable Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) to say that people who arrive in an area to take up temporary employment and stay on at the end of the season, add pressure to the housing waiting lists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire referred to amendment No. 44 which
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>72</span>
seeks to determine Scottish Homes' priorities in its promotional work in a different way. The defect in the amendment is not the anxieties that lie at its heart. Greater
	<br><blockquote><p>"provision of furnished and supported accommodation"</p></blockquote>
would be a valuable contribution to the widening of choice. I am sure that the Committee would not dispute that. However, that is not the same as saying that promotion of that provision should take permanent priority over every other aspect of Scottish Homes' promotional work. Flexibility is required.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the Amendment would take priority over everything else, but the amendment refers to "having particular regard" to the housing need. Scottish Homes should be involved with that. The Minister says that Scottish Homes will be involved with a range of housing needs, so it should be directed towards that matter by including the amendment in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The effect of the amendment would be to write a priority into the Bill. The degree of priority is for Scottish Homes to consider. It will have requests from all over Scotland and must consider them all. It is wrong to require primary legislation to permit Scottish Homes to adjust its priorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to prolong the debate, but the Minister was being almost helpful. He gave a categorical assurance that the main purpose of Scottish Homes will be to provide rented housing. Now he is resisting the inclusion of that main purpose of the face of the Bill. We are discussing the general functions of a new Scottish housing quango which will be involved in the provision of housing, the promotion of wider ownership, improvement of housing and its management, assisting in the development of housing associations and
	<br><blockquote><p>"undertaking, and assisting the undertaking of, the development, redevelopment and improvement of the physical, social and recreational environment related to housing … such other general functions".</p></blockquote>
Everything is mentioned except the encouragement of the provision of housing to rent. Interestingly and significantly, there is a specific reference to providing houses for owner-occupation. If nothing else emerged from our debate, it is the urgent need in Scotland for houses to rent. Why is the Minister resisting the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that he is not prepared to accept amendment No. 44. Is he prepared to write into the Bill at a later stage a recognition of the needs for
	<br><blockquote><p>"the provision of furnished and supported accommodation"?</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may be able to say that for other amendments, but not for amendment No. 44. Scottish Homes must have the necessary flexiblity to respond to urgent priorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the amendment were to read "and having regard to the provision of furnished and supported accommodation", does the Minister
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0119">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>73</span>
accept that that would enable Scottish Homes to have the flexibility to which he refers? That would satisfy our desire to direct Scottish Homes towards that aspect of housing need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that amendment No. 6 would exclude co-operatives and a variety of choice of tenures to tenants, but that is covered in clause 1(3)(d), which refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"promoting the provision and improvement of housing and the improvement of management of housing (whether by its occupants or otherwise)".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, tenants' co-operatives and any other variety of tenure would be available under that provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Priorities must be worked out as to the funding arrangements. There will be competing priorities, as there are for local authorities. It would not be appropriate to write into the Bill the sort of priority sought by that amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no need to itemise in the Bill every sort of rented housing. We are certainly not complacent about homelessness; we are committed to action. I remind honourable Members that we are unequivocally committed to an increase in the quantity and quality of rented housing in Scotland. The Bill is adequate to allow Scottish Homes to play a full part in pursuing that aim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If co-operatives are to be covered, why do the Opposition want to amend clause 1(3)(c)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We wish to amend paragraph (c) to draw the attention of Scottish Homes to the necessity to encourage the provision of good quality housing to let on fair terms. That element is missing from the Bill. Half of the thrust of our argument has been to direct Scottish Homes to the necessity of encouraging housing for rent at a fair rent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has attempted to put up smokescreens by saying that we are opposed to owner-occupation and different varieties of tenure. That is nonsense. Our amendments would not detract from the initiatives that have been taken on owner-occupation. The Minister has been all over the place and has failed to consider the importance of fair-rent accommodation at prices that people can afford, or to the acute needs of the homeless that are worsening in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 5, in page 1, leave out lines 16 to 18.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would remove from Scottish Homes the function of a provider of homes, which was the original objective of the consultative document on Scottish Homes that was issued in May 1987. It was intended that the landlord division should take over the function as manager of houses from the SSHA on the basis that, as soon as it could, it would divest itself of those houses into different forms of tenure. It could allow SSHA tenants to buy the houses, encourage them to establish co-ops or select a private sector landlord under the Bill's provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, my honourable Friend the Member for Glasgow, Gardscadden (Mr. Dewar) summed up the proposal accurately. He referred to the Government's original intention to use the landlord division of Scottish Homes as a transit camp through which SSHA tenants would be encouraged to select different tenures. The proposal changed radically during the period between the consultative document and the White Paper. It went against the spirit of Government's initial intentions regarding Scottish Homes. The organisation was to be used as an enabling agency to pump public funds into different housing projects in partnership with the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A good example of what the Government had in mind was the development of the merchant city in Glasgow. They keep telling us that they are modelling Scottish Homes on the Scottish Development Agency. When I was convenor of Tayside regional council, the SDA invited me and several other councillors to visit the merchant city to study what changes were taking place in the environment. What struck me most about housing in the area, which, I suppose, was the model for the Government's original intentions, was the fact that the SDA had not considered the housing needs of Glasgow, especially the peripheral estates in Easterhouse and Drumchapel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SDA was creating desirable flats in the inner city; for the first time, Glasgow could become famous for yuppies instead of for other matters. There were designer closes and lovely entrances to £30,000 flats. People on good incomes would benefit greatly from that merchant city, but what would happen to those who could not afford such accommodation? Instead, they would be dependent on public sector housing that was suffering a chronic lack of underinvestment because of the Government's policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that the Minister and his colleagues had such a vision in mind when they introduced Scottish Homes. However, they were forced to change it because of the reaction from SSHA tenants. The occupants set up fierce resistance to the Government's suggestion that they should enter into the transit camp and end up in different types of tenure. They set up the national association of SSHA tenants to fight the Scottish Homes proposal

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>75</span>
and, specifically, to convince the Government of the wisdom of treating the SSHA separately from the other proposals in the "Scottish Homes" document. That is the main thrust of amendment No. 5. The Government should be doing not what they think is best for the SSHA tenants, but what the SSHA tenants think is best for themselves. That is the central failure of the Government—they have totally ignored the wishes of SSHA tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Minister again of the point that I raised on Second Reading, which he has yet to answer. Why have the Government not allowed SSHA tenants to ballot on the future of the SSHA itself? The Government continually speak in favour of ballots. Only yesterday, the Secretary of State for Energy spoke glowingly about trade union ballots, and about a certain president of a certain union and how the percentage of the ballot had gone down. The Government pay great attention to ballots when it suits their purpose, but here a ballot would give the wrong answer. That is the main reason for their hostility to a ballot of SSHA tenants. As the chairman of the SSHA, Mr. Derek Mason, has told the Government, everyone knows what the outcome of such a ballot would be. Almost all SSHA tenants would reject the proposals for transferring them into the landlord division of Scottish Homes. Will the Minister explain why the Government have failed to consult the tenants and or to give them a say in whether the SSHA should be abolished and taken over by the Scottish Homes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must reject the charge that there has been no consultation. There most certainly has been consultation. Meetings and a conference have formed part of the representations made by the SSHA, whose response was taken into account. A letter from the chairman of the SSHA was sent to all tenants and a letter from my right honourable and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland was circulated to them, making it absolutely clear that all their rights remained intact and that many of the rights that they enjoyed were introduced by him under the Tenants' Rights, etc. (Scotland) Act 1980, which was opposed by the Labour party. The right to security of tenure, the right to succession and the right to buy at a discount are on the statute book and the Government will stand by them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For many tenants there will be virtually no change. They will remain in the same houses. Their wishes will be entirely respected. In due course, other options might be put before them. Whether or not they decided to take up those possibilities would be entirely a matter for them. There has not been a change of policy. We believe that Scottish Homes should offer its tenants the widest possible range of options and that tenants will be attracted by them. It was implicit in our report that tenants would have a choice, as any fair-minded person would expect from the Government which introduced the Tenants' Rights, etc. (Scotland) Act 1980.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of what the honourable Gentleman has said is relevant to clause 3. We have tabled an amendment about ballots, and we shall deal with that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>76</span>
In relation to amendment No. 5. I am happy to assure the Committee that the purpose of the functions in paragraph (b) of subsection (3) is primarily to enable Scottish Homes to assume the function carried out today by the Scottish Special Housing Association. Under the terms of clause 3 the functions of the SSHA—which are not by and large, enshrined in statute—are transferred together with the assets, liabilities and obligations of that body to Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we know, the SSHA is a major landlord with about 83,000 houses currently within its ownership and management. In its long and distinguished career it has provided more than 110,000 houses, some of which have been sold to the tenants. Others have been transferred to other owners, including local authorities. Its achievement has been considerable. As Scottish Homes will be entirely a creature of statute, it requires to have all its functions and powers explicitly stated in the Bill. Therefore, it is necessary to provide for the new body to continue the old functions of the SSHA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, that is primarily the purpose of those words. However, Scottish Homes may become the landlord of other houses. Indeed, part III of the Bill is intended to provide for Scottish Homes to be a receiving landlord under the tenants' choice proposals. No doubt we shall discuss that further when we come to part III. It is also quite likely that Scottish Homes will enter into partnership with other persons or bodies to do some of the things mentioned in paragraph (b). For example, it may join with a local authority to provide, repair or improve housing. In such circumstances, Scottish Homes needs to be able to act in conjunction with any other person or body and the concluding words of paragraph (b) provide for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that explanation, I hope that the honourable Gentleman will feel able to withdraw his amendment. Failing that, I must ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can understand why the Minister is chary about ballots—his party was almost obliterated in a ballot on 11 June last year—but in due course we shall have an opportunity to talk about the case for consulting SSHA tenants about the future of their tenure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment moved by my honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) gives us an opportunity to explore briefly whether it is appropriate to combine the SSHA with the Housing Corporation in Scotland and to give it a range of other functions, or whether SSHA should remain a free-standing operation for the moment. On balance we believe that it would be better to amalgamate the Scottish end of the Housing Corporation and the SSHA to form part of a new Scottish housing agency, although we have misgivings about the Government's proposed style for that agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principal point is that the position of Scottish Special Housing Association tenants should not be eroded. They should not lose any of the rights or standards to which they have become accustomed
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0121">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>77</span>
and which have been established during their relationship with their public sector landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much has been said about choice. Tenants will have a choice for all manner of things provided that they move out of the public sector. It is one-way traffic. SSHA tenants will not have the option under the Bill of transferring to district council tenure or Islands council tenure. The Government are being less than frank when they say that the Bill is about free choice. The choice that the Government are trying to engineer is that as many people as possible should be cajoled and squeezed out of public sector tenancies into private sector tenancies which will become more expensive and less secure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a probing amendment. The Minister said a little about the future of that section of Scottish Homes which will be the successor to the SSHA. We seek an assurance that the position of SSHA tenants will not be eroded by the new regime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can answer the honourable Gentleman clearly by saying that my right honourable and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland, in his letter to SSHA tenants, emphasised that
	<br><blockquote><p>"SSHA tenants will not lose any of their legal rights when they become tenants of Scottish Homes. They will continue to have security of tenture, the right to succession, the right to buy and all the other statutory rights"</p></blockquote>
given to them by the Government in the Tenants' Rights, etc. (Scotland) Act 1980, for which the Secretary of State had ministerial responsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred again to the correspondence sent to all SSHA tenants by the chairman of the SSHA—one of those rare creatures who was once a Conservative district councillor in Glasgow—and by the Secretary of State. The Minister's assurances would be more convincing if at the same time as circulating material on behalf of the Government and their representatives the Scottish Special Housing Association tenants organisations had been afforded similar facilities to circulate information and consultation documents among tenants, but that right was denied to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, any individual can circulate a document if he or she wishes. The official position was made clear by my right honourable and learned Friend the Secretary of State, and he was entitled and right to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was glad to hear the honourable Gentleman say that he did not necessarily disagree with the idea of a unified agency, or words to that effect. The honourable Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said on Second Reading that he did not object to the concept of putting together the SSHA and the Housing Corporation and that there was a case for reform. Those were wise words, and I am glad to see that the honourable Gentleman is coming round to agreeing with what is the central principle behind the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>78</span>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may be pleased to be able to agree with my honourable Friends the Members for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) and for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertston), but he has got to get the SSHA tenants to agree with him. He has not satisfied the Committee that he has even attempted to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all very well for the Secretary of State for Scotland to issue letters to SSHA tenants—and for Mr. Derek Mason to do so. I come from the Tayside region and know from experience what happens when the consultation process is carried out by Tory authorities. When the subject was education, the Tory authority apparently ignored the evidence that came up in consultation and went ahead with what it intended to do, anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want consultation; we want people to have a genuine say about their future. We will return to the subject and force the Government to consider it sooner or later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I might point out to the honourable Gentleman that last summer I was present at the meeting between my right honourable and learned Friend and the steering committee. The committee asked him for a letter, and he responded, setting out that their tenants' rights under statute would most certainly be retained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should seriously question the commitment of the Secretary of State in sending a letter in which he said that the rents of the SSHA tenants were safe with him. They may be safe with him, but only so long as tenants do not take advantage of the provisions of the Bill. As soon as an SSHA tenant opts for a new private sector landlord and moves to the private sector, he loses the right to buy his own house and to pick his landlord. As I said on Second Reading, that is a right that a tenant can only lose once.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the honourable Gentleman accept that tenants of Scottish Homes will be secure tenants? They will not. as has been incorrectly suggested, be in assured tenancies. My right honourable and learned Friend said that those rights would remain guaranteed by existing legislation. It will be impossible for anyone to deny tenants their rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that I am trying to get the Minister to accept is that the rights are secure so long as the tenants stay where they are and do not move. But families move the whole time—perhaps five or six times in the course of a lifetime—and, as soon as they do so, they lose the rights on which the Secretary of State has given a copper-bottomed, or iron-bottomed guarantee. But the rights will be secure only so long as tenants stay where they are; the rights are weakened and undermined by the provisions of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the Secretary of State's letters are genuinely misleading people about the full implications of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0122">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>79</span>
The Minister also added that there had been no change of policy. But that is ludicrous. The consultative document clearly stated that as soon as possible the new landlord division would divest itself of the houses that it took over from the SSHA. The Minister now tells us that the landlord division will be a receiving body that can take people in as new tenants. That is a complete reversal of the original argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does the Minister no good to try to con the Committee into believing that there has been no change of policy. There has been one, and it has been the cause of the SSHA tenants' resistance. That resistance will be maintained until the Government concede to the tenants not only the right to be consulted—that is, to have letters sent to them—but to vote on their future.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amedments give the Committee an opportunity to explore the relationship between Scottish Homes and elected Scottish local housing authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 7 proposes that Scottish Homes should have a function to promote the provision and improvement of housing and its management
	<br><blockquote><p>"in consultation with the District or Islands Councils for the areas concerned."</p></blockquote>
The fundamental issue is which is to be the lead authority for determining housing policy in each locality in Scotland. Will an elected local council—which does the job at present, in conjunction with planning authorities—decide the future of a housing estate or community, or will that function be passed to the nominated quango to be known as Scottish Homes?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week I said that the payment of improvement grants for private sector housing was a function of local authorities, and it was asked whether that function would pass to Scottish Homes. The Minister
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>80</span>
said that we would discuss how to deal with the duplication of concurrent powers at some future point. It would be useful if he would say more about that matter now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our view is that Scottish Homes should not be the initiator of local housing policy, which should remain with those who are elected to do that job in the local housing authorities of the district councils and islands councils of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 20 would incorporate a requirement to consult the local authority on the exercise of all 19 general functions listed in clause 2. Again, it relates to a fundamental issue—who is to be the leader in determining policy for all the detailed functions of Scottish Homes in every neighbourhood in Scotland? Will it be a great, centralised, nominated organisation called Scottish Homes, based in Glasgow, Edinburgh or elsewhere, or will it be the local district councils or islands councils know their neighbourhoods and have been elected to determine those policies?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 21 would enable a local authority to act as an agent for Scottish Homes. The examples that I have in mind are of the present relationship between the SSHA and certain local authorities. Last year, I visited the Shetland islands and was interested to discover that they have a few SSHA houses. Probably rightly, the SSHA direct works organisation reckoned that it was not worthwhile to send people from the mainland to carry out minor repairs to those houses. It established an agency service whereby the Shetland islands council housing department undertakes that function in the islands. No doubt there are similar organisations throughout the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a right to nominate tenants. We shall return to that matter as important arrangements in many localities allow the SSHA to develop houses in certain areas on the clear understanding that local authorities have the right to nominate the tenants. There are such houses in my constituency and, in effect, they form part of the local authority's housing stock. When an SSHA house becomes available for letting, people on the local authority waiting list will have an opportunity to be considered for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 24 provides for a local authority to be consulted about the disposal of land belong to Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments cover a range of detailed matters and I hope that the Minister will respond positively to them. However, we should like to clarify an important point of principle and trust that he will advise the Committee on a slightly more accommodating and positive basis than was the case in the two previous debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear for the future position of local authorities in Scotland. The thrust of the Government's activities has sought to marginalise local authorities, to elbow them aside and to give more of the decision-making powers to Ministers. It is worse in England where some local authorities have been abolished. Some Tories want to abolish the Inner London education authority. No less a person than the honourable Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) has signed
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0123">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>81</span>
that important early-day motion. We are dealing with people who do not place a high value on local democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must not be surprised if the Opposition are suspicious of a huge new quango with immense and wide-ranging powers over housing. We fear that the Government may intend that body to supplant the rights and functions of local housing authorities in Scotland. I fear that it will lead to the removal of the only vestige of democratic government left in Scotland. So much power is concentrated in the hands of the Secretary of State for Scotland that many people think that it is oppressive. It could be argued that that is the only way that he can govern because he cannot get Conservatives elected to regional and district councils in Scotland. The Conservatives control only four district councils in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not the fault of the people of Scotland that they disagree with the principles and ideas of the Secretary of State. It is not reasonable for him to seek to manipulate the machinery of Government in order to ensure that he gets his way, regardless of the wishes of the Scottish people. It is bizarre that we have a Secretary of State who has so much power over life in Scotland on the strength of less than 25 per cent. of the votes. We shall debate that matter on the Floor of the House tomorrow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recently, people in Scotland have looked to their local authorities to defend them from some of the Government's more damaging policies, whether in relation to housing or to anything else. But time after time the Government have sought to undermine and challenge the ability of those local authorities to do the job that they were elected to do. They have been rate-capped and constrained and a set of new duties has been imposed upon them. Now there is the threat of the new organisation, Scottish Homes, nominated by the Secretary of State for Scotland, taking absolute power over the administration of the most detailed housing decisions and investment in every part of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is another example of the patronage of the Secretary of State for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I went to the Library this morning to ask for a list of those nominated to positions of authority by the Secretary of State, hoping that the Library staff would be able to tell me that it was so many hundreds or thousands. I was given a computer print-out of names, but no running total. It takes about half a kilo of flimsy paper to list those appointed to health boards—we know what is happening to health boards now—and other organisations which take decisions. The are nominated by the Secretary of State and, in the case of health boards, they have been nominated not with the objective of improving the Health Service in Scotland but as policemen to do the bidding of the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland who wants services privatised. That is one example of a nominated organisation. There is a genuine and reasonable fear that the Scottish Homes quango will operate in the same way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party believes in local democracy. If a local authority is elected to do a job, it should have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>82</span>
the right to carry out its own policy decisions on housing and other local services. That has been the tradition in Scotland since time immemorial. We deplore the erosion of those principles in recent years and we fear that the position is another mechanism whereby the Government will elbow aside elected local authorities and determine policies on investment, housing and so on through a nominated quango at national level. That would be deplorable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want the Scottish Development Agency to work in partnership with local authorities and to support those authorities in their efforts to provide for the housing needs in their areas. If that is what the Minister has in mind. Labour Members will co-operate fully, but I am afraid that the Minister may be trying to create a different sort of monster.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seem to have been designed to shackle Scottish Homes and local authorities together, rather than to allow a spirit of mutual co-operation and partnership to develop naturally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Homes Robertson) asked who makes policy. Paragragh 6.3 of the White Paper reaffirms local authorities' strategic role in their own areas. Scottish Homes will be able to assist them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised that Opposition Members believe it necessary to lay down such formal consultation requirements as the amendments propose. No one in the Committee, the Housing Corporation, the SSHA or the Confederation of Scottish Local Authorities believes that Scottish Homes can proceed entirely independently. Obviously it cannot. The success of the SSHA and Housing Corporation, which we hope to transfer to Scottish Homes, is built on good relations with local authorities and willingness on both sides to make the best use of opportunities. Those parties have co-operated on many schemes. The work in Dundee and the great variety of schemes in Glasgow and Paisley, including the current project to transfer perhaps 700 houses from Glasgow district Council to the SSHA, show that co-operation is a fact of life in housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is, however, misguided to suggest that everything done by Scottish Homes will require consultation with local authorities. Scottish Homes may become involved in activities that do not concern local authorities and we must be careful not to introduce too much red tape. One of the advantages of bodies such as Scottish Homes and the Scottish Development Agency is their ability to act very quickly when required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sort of Consultation proposed in the amendments would not add anything to the processes that are already in hand and may, because of their formal and indiscriminate nature, lead to a weakening of the interchange between Scottish Homes and local auhorities in matters where that is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn, failing which I shall ask the Committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I try to be fair. The Minister stated the Government's position and I confess that, in the past, his comments have been broadly true. Housing association work, both locally and nationally, has increased and, under the Bill, will expand greatly. It will no longer be true to say that housing associations can box and cox. The thrust of the Bill is that the onus will change. It will be impossible to place on local authorities a strategic overall planning commitment and duty that can ignore the work of housing associations. The Minister's analysis of how local authorities operated in the past may be correct, but I am worried about the way in which the two bodies will compete and conflict. No provision in the Bill will stop that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that some provisions concerning the two bodies are contained in later clauses, but they give me no confidence whatever that the relationship that will develop between Scottish Homes and local authorities will be anything approaching a partnership. If that prediction is true, it will be a sad day for Scottish housing. The only people who will suffer will be public sector tenants.

The compilation of the three-year rolling housing plans that my local authority sends to me regularly set out in clear detail what it is trying to achieve, but that programme has to be amended taking account of the money available year on year. Those housing plans give a clear focus and direction and I wonder whether my local authority will be able to send me such clear statements in future because it will be so beset by the work of Scottish Homes and other bodies that may go against the grain of its plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's answer was disgracefully complacent. He has a chance to achieve a partnership between the bodies. He knows that my local authority is sympathetic and is trying to work with the grain of his proposals, but it sees problems with regard to the provision of housing. If that is true for my area, I do not know what will happen in Stirling or in other areas where local authorities have a much more ideological stance regarding the provisions of services. The Minister's answer was wholly inadequate and I beg the Government to consider how the Bill will affect local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was concerned that the Mnister should use emotive language such as "shackled together". The amendments did not refer to that kind of relationship between local authorities and Scottish Homes. If the Minister is serious when he says that he wants local authorities and district councils to adopt a strategic role in the provision of housing, he must accept that they need to consult everybody that provides housing in the area. There must be consultation with Scottish Homes. There should be no quarrel with an amendment which asks for consultation to be included in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was also slightly worried by the Minister's
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>84</span>
suggestion that Scottish Homes will involve itself in action that has got nothing to do with district councils. What kind of action has nothing to do with district councils if that action is directed towards providing housing in the district council's area? The district council has a strategic role and a direct interest in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried that Scottish Homes has been modelled on the SDA. It has not been unknown for the SDA to turn back on a project without proper consultation with local authorities or the people of the area. The SDA really wants to make an offer that people cannot refuse or nothing. That is how Scottish Homes might act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish Homes will be a potential competitor with district councils under the pick-a-landlord scheme. Scottish Homes will be seen as a threat, so it is important that it establishes close relationships with district councils so that that prejudice and worry can be broken down. The Minister seems to be setting his face in direct opposition to closer work between district councils and Scottish Homes. That is tragic. I hope that he will listen to the Opposition and accept our amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, as a matter of common sense, I would expect Scottish Homes to consult local authorities, but we see it more as a partnership agreement than a matter for a statutory requirement for consultation on every issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The approach that we have pursued from the beginnning is that Scottish Homes should be willing and able to co-operate with local authorities and others. The ability of the Housing Corporation and the SSHA to co-operate with local authorities, and their willingness to do so in the past, are good examples of how that process could be operated effectively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be helpful if the Minister could explain the implications of partnership agreements. Is he saying that Scottish Homes must enter into written contracts on each project before it proceeds?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw to the honourable Gentleman's attention the example of Castlemilk when the SSHA received an extra allocation of £2 million from the Government. It then negotiated with the district council, and 700 or more tenants were fully involved in that consultaiton process. Such a procedure will, inevitably, take place under the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not make myself clear. I was asking a more technical question. Does each project, which is entered into by Scottish Homes, require a partnership agreement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A merger agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A merger agreement, if the honourable Gentleman wishes. Having spent a weekend at the seaside, I am quite happy to deal with

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>85</span>
such questions from a sedentary or any other position. Will there be a written partnership agreement prior to any project, which is sponsored by Scottish Homes, proceeding in a local authority area?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The process would be a continuation of what happens at present. With regard to formal partnership agreements, the answer is no. Discussion on matters of common interest will take place. Some schemes might involve contracts, but that is unlikely to be the norm for all. If the honourable Gentleman consulted the Housing Corporation about the arrangements of each housing association, it would advise him that some developments have taken place without contracts with local authorities. It is a process of evolution and common sense. An agreement does not need to be written into the statute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I become a little worried when a Tory Minister for Scotland refers to common sense and evolution, as that evolution process for the Tory party in Scotland over recent years seems to be that its power has increased while its representation has diminished. We are not particularly reassured by what the Minister has said. He has made glib comments about partnership, motherhood and other comfortable good-sounding concepts. He referred to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>86</span>
the useful partnership among the local authorities, housing associations and the SSHA in Glasgow and Dundee. That co-operation is happening at present. Local authorities are trying to get on with the job of providing housing to meet the needs of their communities in spite of the constraints imposed on them by the Government. We are trying to explore what will happen under the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not enough for the Minister to keep referring to fine-sounding phrases in the White Paper. We are discussing a Bill that will be the governing factor for housing legislation in the future. The Bill does not seem to require the sort of partnership that the Minister is advocating. I am disturbed when he reads briefs which speak of "shackling" district councils to Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fundamental question is who will be the initiator of housing policy in Scotland? The Minister should tell us which organisation will receive the budget. Will it be the local housing authority, or Scottish Homes? I am anxious for the Minister's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
