<div class='page-header'><h1>Housing (SCOTLAND) Bill</h1></div>
<p>[Continued from col. 1152]</p>
<p>9 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming—</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 53(4) provides that an application
<br><blockquote><p>"shall cease to have effect"</p></blockquote>
if the tenant "withdraws his consent" by serving notice to that effect on the landlord. That application is by an approved person to exercise the rights to acquire, which part II provides. That is clarified by clause 53(1), which provides that the application is:
<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of exercising the right conferred by this Part."</p></blockquote>
Since the application is exercised at right, it will continue to be current, unless it is either withdrawn or ceases to have effect, until the point at which that right is successfully exercised.<br><br>
Clause 55(1) clarifies that the right is finally exercised by service of a "notice of acceptance". Until the notice of acceptance is served, a current application still exists, which can be withdrawn or cease to have effect. After the right has been exercised, no application is current. There is nothing to be withdrawn or to cease to have effect.<br><br>
The tenant can put a stop to the proposed transaction by giving notice to the landlord that he withdraws his consent any time before, but not after, the applicant services notice of acceptance under clause 55. In view of the uncertainty, I shall consider whether we can clarify the provisions, but I cannot guarantee that that will be done on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There has been interesting speculation about when that will be. According to rumours, the printers will be struggling to reprint the Bill in time to table amendments on Report. That would be entirely consistent with the Government's thoroughly objectionable conduct over the Bill. That can be dealt with through the proverbial usual channels, which I note are functioning in fine style at present.<br><br>
The Minister has confirmed that even after a tenant has completed negotiations about the terms of a lease with an acquiring landlord, he can still abort the process, providing that he withdraws the initial consent before missives are exchanged or completed. We were indebted to the interventions of my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South and the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross. I was
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1154</span>
going to ask which comes first, the chicken or the egg—the completion of the lease or the completion of the sale?<br><br>
The Minister has now specifically confirmed that the lease is a side issue and that the tenant can extricate himself from this dangerous position right up to the time when the buying landlord has accepted the offer that the local authority has been compelled by the Government to give.<br><br>
Presumably that will involve legal expenses and administrative work. I am not remotely interested in the difficulties or expenses that speculative landlords will incur, but I am worried that local authorities could incur administrative expenses by taking conditions to the Lands Tribunal, for example. They may incur legal costs for what may be a wild goose chase if the speculative landlord bows out or the tenant pulls the plug at the last minute.<br><br>
Will local authorities have to foot the bill for those legal expenses and, if so, will the Government compensate them? The costs may be considerable as they may involve many individual, small transactions. As usual, the Government impose those duties on local authorities. Who will pay for them?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Each party must meet its own costs, but the income from sales under tenants' choice will be greater than the costs involved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a most extraordinary reply, but I suppose that we should be surprised no longer by the crass remarks of the Government and the Minister. We have exposed the machinery for the farce that it is likely to be. I am grateful for the assurance that even after the lease has been negotiated it will still be possible for the tenant to abort the process. I hope that most tenants will avail themselves of that right before they get into the difficulties that will inevitably arise from being forced into the insecurity and difficulties inherent in assured tenancies. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.<br><br>
<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i><br><br>
<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister comment on clause 55 and the notice of acceptance? Once again, the tenant will not give notice of acceptance. The acquiring landlord will give notice of acceptance to the reluctant seller—the local authority. Tenants will have the right to intervene directly to abort the process, but the transaction will not involve directly the tenant and will take place between the speculative landlord, whom the Government want to enourage, and the public-sector landlord, whom the Government want to discourage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 55 deals with the procedures for accepting offers to sell. In particular, it provides that a notice of acceptance will be of no effect unless the tenant and the new landlord have concluded a lease, conditional on the sale proceeding, for a period after the sale is completed. With the time-limt set out, those procedures are clear and will probably protect tenants' interests.</span></p>

REFUSAL OF APPLICATIONS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that a public-sector landlord may refuse an application from an acquiring landlord, but I should like to know on what grounds that can be done, so that we may build on them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 56 makes provision for a landlord to serve a notice refusing an application to acquire. That can be done on the grounds that the landlord disputes the applicant's right to acquire, or that the information contained in the application is materially incorrect. The clause requires the landlord to specify his grounds for refusing an application. It further provides for the applicant to apply to the Lands Tribunal for a finding that, despite the landlord's refusal, he is entitled to exercise the right to acquire. Those procedures properly safeguard both the position of the landlord and the applicant, by involving the Lands Tribunal in this way.<br><br>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
SECRETARY OF STATE'S POWER TO AUTHORISE REFUSAL IN THE CASE OF CERTAIN HOUSES PROVIDED FOR PERSONS OF PENSIONABLE AGE</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I wish to move that the clause should not stand part of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I shall have to propose the Question.<br><br>
<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was trying to disown that clause, which is the property of the Committee. I am grateful to you, Mr. Martin, for protecting our rights. Clauses 57 and 58 are interesting. I have sat on many Committees dealing with Scottish local government but I cannot think of any previous occasion when a Minister has decided to abandon two clauses of a Bill.<br><br>
We know what has happened. The Minister has introduced amendments to earlier clauses which cover broadly the same points as clauses 57 and 58.<br><br>
The Opposition are chided from time to time for our deficiencies in drafting amendments and new clauses. It looks as though the laugh is on the Government this time round. Following the White Paper the parliamentary draftsmen went to a lot of trouble to draft the two clauses.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1156</span>
The Bill was printed and received a Second Reading. Now, the Government have decided that they do not want the clauses after all. That illustrates the haste with which the Government have proceeded with the legislation, and also that the original drafting must have been fundamentally flawed.<br><br>
The Government have decided not to have the clauses, and particularly clause 57, giving the Secretary of State the power to authorise refusal in the case of certain houses provided for persons of pensionable age. Earlier we debated amendments on that general subject.<br><br>
The Bill and the right to buy legislation should contain far better safeguards, so that local authorities who build purpose-designed houses for elderly or disabled people in Scotland can ensure that that property remains available for such people. Local authorities willingly build such accommodation, at considerable expense. However, they are required, under legislation, to sell it to the successors of disabled people or people of pensionable age who may not be disabled or of pensionable age. That is absolutely crazy. That property is taken out of circulation and no longer available to those for whom it was designed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is clear from the absence of amendments that the hon. Gentleman found no fault with clauses 57 or 58. It is filibustering hypocrisy for him to start rabbiting on about the clause which is going to be withdrawn.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It takes one to know one.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman may not have noticed, but the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West gave notice to the Committee, quite some time ago, that he intended to withdraw the clauses. Therefore, it would have been futile to table amendments. I am sorry if the honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross is embarrassed by the failure of his colleague to make a decent job of presenting the Bill to Committee. I wish an explanation from the Under-Secretary about what went wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to respond. The standards of the parliamentary draftsmen of the Scottish Office are the highest of any Whitehall Department. If improvements can be made to the legislation, they will be made.<br><br>
The clause empowers landlords to apply to the Secretary of State for authority not to sell certain houses which have been specially adapted for persons of pensionable age.<br><br>
However, clause 51(4), as amended earlier by Committee in response to Government amendment No. 469, now excepts completely from the provisions of part III of the Bill all houses for the elderly or the disabled which are either exempted from the right to buy provisions of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987, or where there is discretion for a local authority to impose a "buy-back" condition if the right to buy is exercised. No approach to the Secretary of State will be necessary.</span></p>

POWER TO REFUSE IN THE CASE OF CERTAIN HOUSES REQUIRED FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.<br><br>
9.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Here we go again. The clause deals with island councils and their educational houses. What has gone wrong this time?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause confers on islands councils the power to refuse an application to acquire under the provisions of part III of the Bill if the house to which the application refers is held by the council for the purposes of its functions as education authority and is required for the accommodation of a person who is, or will be, employed by the council for those purposes.<br><br>
However, Clause 51(4), as amended earlier by the Committee in response to Government amendment No. 470, now incorporates the provisions formerly contained in clause 58.<br><br>
Clause 58 is therefore no longer required.<br><br>

Clause 59</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
REFERENCE TO LANDS TRIBUNAL</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 586, in page 36, line 36, leave out "any other person" and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"the landlord or the applicant".</p></blockquote>
This is a tentatively presented probing amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That means he does not understand it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand it and I think that I know the answer.<br><br>
The amendment was suggested by Shelter, and seeks to limit the powers of the lands tribunal to "do anything" instead of any other person. It is felt that the words "any other person" are far too wide, and that the Bill should specify the parties involved—the landlord or the applicant. The remit of the lands tribunal should be restricted to those persons.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am in general sympathy with the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran). As drafted, the provisions of subsection (2) would allow the lands tribunal to act in place of any person who is required by the provisions of that part of the Bill to discharge a duty. I agree that that provision is too wide. All that is needed is a provision to enable the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1158</span>
lands tribunal to act in the place of the landlord. However, it is not necessary to give the lands tribunal power to act also on behalf of the applicant, because, if the applicant fails to do anything within the relevant time, the application is merely deemed to be withdrawn. The applicant must decide whether he wishes to take the steps necessary to effect the transfer.<br><br>
We intend to table amendments to subsection (2) to make it clear that the lands tribunal is expected to act only in the place of the landlord, and not in the place of a wider range of interested parties. I hope that in the light of that the hon. Member will be able to withdraw his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was what I expected. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

Clause 60</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
CONSENT FOR SUBSEQUENT DISPOSALS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 522, in page 36, line 43, after "Act", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"or his liquidator, receiver or trustee in bankruptcy".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 574, in page 36, line 43, after "Act", insert "or any subsequent purchaser".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The notes on clause 60 say that the purpose of the clause is to introduce an element of control over subsequent disposals of property by requiring the consent of Scottish Homes to be obtained for further disposal. The amendment aims to safeguard the interests of tenants by preventing approved persons from selling houses to persons who have not been approved. The amendment has been suggested by Dundee district council. It is not a wrecking amendment—it simply aims to improve the protection of tenants and to prevent the clause from being used by unscrupulous landlords to pass on a property to a person who had not been approved by Scottish Homes. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment which is put forward in the interests of the tenants, Scottish Homes and the good operation of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I subscribe to the arguments of the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion). His suggestion is entirely sensible. It is a positive addition to the Bill and the Government should consider it. I should have thought that the reasons for amendment No. 574 were blindingly obvious. If it is logical that approval has to be given first and second purchasers approved by Scottish Homes, surely it is illogical and against the tenants' interests not to require Scottish Homes to approve subsequent purchasers. I cannot see the objection to that and so the Government should consider the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In practice, amendment No. 522 would not change the provisions
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0716">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1159</span>
involved in winding up the affairs of the landlord. The first disposal of the property will none the less take place when the receiver sells the property to another landlord. As this is a first disposal it is covered by the requirement to obtain the approval of Scottish Homes. I do not believe that it is necessary to include the words suggested in the amendment, and I invite the hon. Member to withdraw his amendment.<br><br>
I cannot accept amendment No. 574 either. We are aware of the possibility that some scope for abuse could exist if there were no provision in the Bill to control subsequent disposals of property transferring under tenants' choice provisions. Clause 61(1) therefore requires approval for the first disposal by an approved landlord. We feel that to extend that provision further to cover subsequent disposals would be bureaucratic and unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A question immediately flows from the Minister's logic. He says that the protection is needed only the first time round. Suppose there is collusion and companies are set up. There could be a very quick second, third or subsequent disposal. What is to prevent that happening? What is there to protect the tenants' interests in that situation? It is slightly complacent just to say, "We will do it the first time round and that will give us some cover. It is all a question of balance of judgments and that is good enough." I doubt that that is good enough. I am not satisfied that that is sufficient protection. I can understand that it should not be taken all the way down the line and I can understand that on a cumulative basis a massive amount of checking and cross-checking would be necessary as properties were handed on from one person to another, but the protection build into the Bill is unsatisfactory. I ask the Minister to reconsider.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood). I accept the Minister's explanation about our amendment but I feel that some protection has to be given in subsequent disposals after the first which is protected under the clause. Subsequent disposals should be a matter of concern to the Minister. He admitted himself that there is some scope for abuse. He should recognise that many people in Scotland will be prepared to use that scope to abuse the Bill and manipulate it in their interests. The Minister must look at that. I appeal to him to recognise that it is the Government's responsibility to make sure that the loophole is closed so there is no scope for exploitation and a property cannot be passed on to a landlord who has not been approved by Scottish Homes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Our policy recognises that without some control over subsequent property disposal there could be collusion between an approved landlord and some other body interested in obtaining public sector property who had not attracted the approval of Scottish Homes for one reason or another. It is only reasonable to have some protection, certainly for the first disposal. Given that,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1160</span>
in our view, the prospect of this type of abuse is much less likely on subsequent disposal, we felt that it was unnecessary to include this provision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why is the Minister making a distinction between the first and subsequent disposals? The problem is just as likely to occur with subsequent disposals as with the first. The Minister must explain why it is necessary to offer protection in the first but not in subsequent disposals. He talks nonsense most of the time but on this issue he should give the Committee a proper explanation of his absurd comment that abuse is less likely in subsequent disposals. He may wishfully think that that is the case but it is unlikely. Some people will wait their time to abuse this part of the Bill and the Minister should be aware of that and do something about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire asked what would prevent a quick second and subsequent transfer. Scottish Homes will obviosly examine closely the bona fides of the first subsequent prospective landlord. The approval will not be lightly given. The record of suitability of the second landlord will be carefully considered. It goes without saying that tenants will continue to have rights as assured tenants even though their landlord changes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does that mean that if the second or subsequent landlord to whom the property is proposed to be transferred is not acceptable to Scottish Homes it would stymie the transaction at that stage without further ado?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that that would happen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Just say yes or no.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have said yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am worred about what the Minister has just said.<br><br>
My experience in this area has not been good. I remember a company in Dundee with which I dealt.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Name it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not going to name anyone. I got into a dispute with this company on behalf of one of its tenants. Before I knew where I was the landlord had changed. After some investigation I discovered that it was not just one company but eight. Property floated between them. The shareholders were always the same, a husband and wife team who acquired large quantities of run-down property, usually in the city centre but some of it on the outskirts. From day to day, tenants never knew who their landlord was. The property floated between the companies, companies floated between companies and it was impossible to trace them.<br><br>
I hope that in such a situation there would be proper scrutiny by Scottish Homes and that such a landlord would not get approval. However, we have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0717">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1161</span>
no guarantee of that because we do not know what criteria will be adopted. The Bill takes a liberal and wishy-washy approach and I should hate that to be translated into the action visited upon landlords by Scottish Homes. These are serious issues.<br><br>
9.30 pm<br><br>
One loophole in the Bill is that it would be easy for a company shareholding to be transferred to another company or to other individuals. That would effectively deny any right of scrutiny on the second transfer. It would simply be necessary to sell the shareholding or create another company which would be superimposed on the existing company. There is no way that Scottish Homes would be able to look behind the company because there would be no transfer of the property as such, but a transfer of company ownership. Where would the tenant be in such a situation? Where would be the protection, which the Minister is so proud to boast will be offered to the tenant, when Scottish Homes does not know what is happening?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Another point has occurred to me as a result of that helpful invervention by the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran). If there is such a close legal connection between companies which are acting as landlords that it is difficult to differentiate between them, how much scope will Scottish Homes have to take the power that the Minister said was available to them to deny the transfer? The difficulties in determining which company is the parent company and which the subsidiary company where there are similar, overlapping shareholdings and so on raise questions about the legal identity of the landlord. Have the Government given any thought to how Scottish Homes would act in those circumstances?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is important to remember that the expertise of both the Housing Corporation and the SSHA is considerable. In terms of approval, the matter will be taken very seriously.<br><br>
I shall think further about what has been said by the hon. Members for Dundee, East and for Roxburgh and Berwickshire. I do not make any commitment to change, but I shall consider whether Scottish Homes' approval should be necessary for disposals for a set period after the initial transfer. I think that the hon. Member for Dundee, East was suggesting that there could be a further transfer fairly soon afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised by the Minister's reference to the expertise of the Housing Corporation and of the SSHA. We do not doubt that there are some very professional experts within both organisations, but the Minister must recognise that unlike, for example, local authorities, most of them do not have any direct experience of having been elected because none of them are elected to their jobs. Therefore, their responsiveness is one stage further removed from the consumers—the tenants—who are the subject of this amendment.<br><br>
The consumers are bypassed in the Bill, and might be bypassed if a landlord, who may have received
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1162</span>
approval but run into financial difficulties or have received a more lucrative offer from another landlord, did a cosy deal with the Housing Corporation, the SSHA or the new body, Scottish Homes, almost behind the tenants' backs. There is nothing in the regulations as they stand, or in the Bill, that would oblige the landlord or Scottish Homes to consult the tenants about the new landlord. That is the nub of the problem.<br><br>
It is all very well for the Minister to speak of expertise but it is an expertise which is administrative and bureaucratic rather than democratic. This amendment seeks to ensure that a landlord could not go over the head of a tenant, do a cosy deal with Scottish Homes and deliver the tenant to the tender mercies of a dubious landlord—or, even where the landlord is not dubious and Scottish Homes has given approval, as it will have to, into the hands of a landlord to whom the tenant would not originally have delivered himself or herself.<br><br>
The Minister has already rejected ballots.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He does not like ballots.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We understand why. He has a much smaller majority than some of the Opposition members of the Committee.<br><br>
It is clear that, without a ballot, it is up to a tenant and a landlord to reach an agreement across the table. The key rationale of the Bill is that the tenant and landlord must form an individual deal that is acceptable to both parties and allows for transfer, sets the rent and decides on the length of tenancy and the type of security of tenure. Without this amendment, a tenant can virtually be forced to enter into an agreement with a further landlord solely on the approval of Scottish Homes. That may be good enough for the Minister, but it is not good enough for us and we do not believe that it is good enough for the tenants.<br><br>
Despite the Bill's limitations, we believe that the tenant is at least entitled to the very limited protection that it gives him. It is clear that without this amendment, all or many of the previous safeguards that the Minister has offered, and in some cases boasted about, will be shelved if a new deal is done between Scottish Homes and a new landlord. The tenant will not necessarily have the same safeguards that he would have if he sought to enter into a new agreement with a new landlord. We seek from the Minister an assurance that that is not the case. The only such assurance that he can give is to accept the ammendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The principle at stake in this amendment is spelt out in the words of—<i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. To allow the hon. Gentleman to be heard, conversations will have to be held more quietly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall have to report them to the Whips.<br><br>
The principle is spelt out in the notes on clauses which refer to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0718">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1163</span>
The principle is spelt out in the notes on clauses which refer to
<br><blockquote><p>"a continuing degree of approval as to the suitability and viability of receiving landlords."</p></blockquote>
That appears to be the aim of the clause, but at the same time it undermines its own aim by saying that there will be control over the
<br><blockquote><p>"suitability and viability of receiving landlords"</p></blockquote>
only for the first dispoal, the notes state:
<br><blockquote><p>"Second and subsequent disposals will require no approval."</p></blockquote>
The Minister referred to Scottish Homes having the power to intervene in second or subsequent disposals. He must explain that more clearly to the Committee. He hinted that he might examine that power and the suggestion that there should be some control for a set period. However, that does not solve the problem.<br><br>
We are speaking not about a set period—whether of six months or a year—but about the number of times that a house is disposed of after the first disposal. That can happen over a number of years. The tenant and the house could pass into the hands of someone whom Scottish Homes would not approve as a viable and respectable landlord. We have to prevent that from happening, but the Minister has said nothing to convince the Committee that he will be able to do so. After 18 months or two years, tenants could find themselves under a landlord whom they had not chosen, who was unsuitable and who might well exploit them. The Minister must concede that, as the clause is drafted, that is a possibility. Surely he wants to do something about that and introduce an element of control over second and subsequent disposals as well as over the first. That is what the amendment is all about.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As we have stripped away the layers of obfuscation that surround the Government's policy on this issue—how about that at this time of night?—another question has occurred to me. What would it cost the Government to track the transfers almost indefinitely? In this age of computerisation, what consideration has been given to sorting out a database for carrying out quick cross-checks on all the transfers? I started off on the premise that that would be an intolerable burden over a long period but, on second thoughts, does not the technology exist to cross-check, monitor and track transfers?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be easy to slip into the assumption that all that was needed was technology. Will the hon. Gentleman consider the possibility of a simple burden and a title deed which would have to be checked on each occasion when the property was transferred?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What a wonderful idea. A burden and a title deed—why not? That is a very neat and simple solution that will mean even more work for lawyers—the perfect solution! I think that that suggestion merits further consideration. There must be ways of monitoring disposals. Perhaps the high-tech fix is not the right solution. I am simply thinking off the top of my head but the more I think
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1164</span>
about it, the more I think that it would not be unreasonable to spend time and energy—within reason—to make sure that transfers and subsequent transfers are monitored.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have already made it clear that I shall consider whether Scottish Homes' approval should be necessary for disposals for a set period after the initial transfer. I recognise that the hon. Member for Dundee, East wishes to go further but that is as far as I can go at this stage, for reasons that I have already given.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to you, Mr. Martin, and to the Committee. I have been characteristically generous to the Minister in my interpretation of the clause and the impact of the amendment. The amendment will not, as I implied earlier, require Scottish Homes to approve a landlord or a subsequent purchaser. All that it requires is that the transfer has the consent of Scottish Homes. It limits the controls placed on anyone to who the property is disposed. I should not have thought that it was too difficult for the Minister to accept the amendment, because it embraces—in a narrow and, I hope, legally correct form—people who might take over and rule the lives of the tenants.<br><br>
I fail to see the Minister's object to that. The Minister confessed a moment ago that he accepts the spirit, if not the wording, of the amendment. By my arithmetic that is about the 28th concession that he has had to make. That is almost 50 per cent. of the clauses. How would the Minister have got it all so wrong up to now? He has had to accept more amendments, as a proportion of the clauses, than have been accepted on the Housing Bill for England and Wales.<br><br>
9.45 pm<br><br>
There too, the Government have got themselves into a pretty pickle. They have had to accept a large number of amendments, not because of parly draftmanship but because of the chronic faulty ideology behind the Bill. It is hardly surprising that over two dozen amendments have been forced on the Minister because the Government's ideology is to support the one group of people—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are discussing amendments Nos. 522 and 574. The hon. Member must try to stick to the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As always, I shall be guided by you, Mr Martin. I was just saying that I believed that the Minister was being guided by the ideological principle that the hands of landlords should not be tied even in the limited way that amendments Nos. 522 and 574 propose. To add:
<br><blockquote><p>"or his liquidator, receiver or trustee in bankruptcy"</p></blockquote>
does not enhance tenants' rights a great deal but it does so sufficiently to enable them to consult a solicitor and find out whether their home can or cannot be handed over lock, stock and barrel to any speculator.<br><br>
Amendment No. 522 requires that there has to be good reason for a disposal—it must be to a liquidator,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0719">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1165</span>
a receiver or a trustee in bankruptcy. If the Minister plans to allow landlords to make a handsome profit out of letting in order to bring rented housing back on to the market—sceptical though we are about that—he should at least create for tenants some safeguards, especially that safeguard in amendment No. 522.<br><br>
Clause 60 is one of the shorter clauses, but its brevity and simplicity leaves it wide open to interpretations. We wish to narrow the possible interpretations in the interests of the tenant, not of the landlord. We believe that amendment No. 522 will discourage landlords from acquiring property purely for speculative reasons—by which I mean, with a view to selling it off as soon as they can realise a profit. The limits in amendment No. 522 will ensure that landlords who want to expand in housing do not do so with the sole motive of making a profit.<br><br>
If the Government fail to accept the amendment, my conclusion will be that profit is paramount, not housing people, ensuring that people have accommodation suitable to their needs or any social reasons. I hope that the Minister will go further than he has. This is the 28th amendment that he has accepted but he has done so only in principle and only in a limited way. We must ask him to think again about the arguments put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion and other colleagues. We hope that he will at least recognise the force of those arguments and accept the need not give too many new rights to the landlord. He will be sorely disappointed, as houses will not flood on to the market. We want to ensure that hundreds and thousands of tenants are not sorely disappointed. We care more about them than the Minister does.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have nothing to add to what I have already said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The important issue is that of subsequent purchasers. It is dealt with by the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr Kirkwood). Is not the Minister worried about second or subsequent disposals of property under the Bill? Does he not care about whether the tenant and property are passed on to a person approved by Scottish Homes? If he does, what is he doing to ensure that that happens?</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived</i></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1166</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 334, in page 36, line 44, after "consent", insert "in writing".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 335, in page 36, line 44, at end insert "authenticated under Seal".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 60(1) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"A person other than Scottish Homes who acquires any property under this Part of the Act shall not dispose of it except with the consent of Scottish Homes."</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 334 seeks to define the method of consent so that no one can claim that consent had been granted over the telephone or in conversation, for example. The consent should be in writing.<br><br>
Amendment No. 335 is more technical. It was suggested by the Law Society of Scotland. I am encouraged by the fact that my hon. Friend the Minister added his name to amendment No. 334. I note that he did not add it to amendment No. 335, but I live in hope.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr Stewart) on tabling amendment No. 334. It seeks to require that the consent of Scottish Homes to any disposal of property required under the provisions should be given in writing. I recommend that sensible proposal to the Committee.<br><br>
Amendment No. 335 is unnecessary. The consent of Scottish Homes is not a document that would normally require formal execution. It is sufficient for consents to be in writing and signed by an authorised officer of Scottish Homes. Under normal conveyancing practice, the consent of Scottish Homes would be recorded in the transfer deed. That deed would be formally executed as laid down in schedule 1(18), which provides in such circumstances for the application of the seal of Scottish Homes and for the signature of one of its members and a duly authorised officer. In the light of the explanation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What does "in writing" mean? Writing is meaningless unless it is holograph or adopted as holograph.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. learned Friend is straying into areas of conveyancing, which was not his speciality although he distinguished himself in other aspects of his legal career. The answer is no.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I may stray from the maze of conveyancing, which I never understood, to the realms of common sense, which the Opposition might not think that I understand either, a clerkette might write or type a document that purports to bind Scottish Homes. "Writing" means what is written by a person or adopted as his writing, which then represents his consent. It is no good getting a chimpanzee to write a consent. Writing has no value unless it is adopted as holograph.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1167</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am beginning to worry about the atmosphere that is building up in the Committee as this is at least the fourth occasion when I have agreed with the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn). That deserves to be recorded. I have already complained about shoddy writing, but I have another complaint. At the tail end of our proceedings, the Minister is prepared to accept that Scottish Homes should give its consent "in writing", or whatever phrase is deemed acceptable. Earlier we argued that agreements between landlords and tenants should be in writing. Why has not the Minister come forward with the results of his deliberations on that issue? What is good enough for Scottish Homes should be good enough for Scottish tenants. Now that we are in the final stages of our deliberations, we are aware of the possible conflicts—who will decide whose word is to rule about the distinction between an assured tenancy and a short assured tenancy if the agreement is not in writing?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said earlier that I was considering the issue of written leases. That is still the case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is the last day.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that I was considering it for the Committee stage. I am considering it for a later stage and I take that commitment seriously.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be helpful if the Minister took this debtate seriously.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He should take it away.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that he accepted the first amendment, but not the second.<br><br>
It was worrying to see the Minister savaging his hon. and learned Friend the Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) in that way. The hon. and learned Gentleman was attacked for his shortcomings in conveyancing—</span></p>
<p>10 pm</p>
<p><i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
<p>10.22 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to see you back in the Chair, Mr. Martin. We were a bit worried that you might have been waylaid in the Division Lobby.<br><br>
Before the Division, we were debating the interesting amendment moved by the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart). Indeed, the hon. Gentleman offers a choice of amendments, both of which take us significantly further forward. Amendment No. 334 requires that the consent of Scottish Homes for the onward disposal of properties taken out of the public sector should be in writing. Amendment No. 335 contained the rather more
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1168</span>
colourful idea of using a seal, which appeals to my sense of the aesthetic.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Do not cull it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross has made a slick pun, considering the time of night, but it is housing that is being culled.<br><br>
The Minister has accepted the amendment in the name of his hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood for the consent to be in writing. Whether that consent is to be handwritten, typewritten, adopted as holograph or in Braille, we do not know, but requiring it to be in writing is a step forward. Otherwise, if the press speculation were proved right and the notorious Earl of Ancram became chairman of Scottish Homes, acting on behalf of his board he could say to someone at a social gathering, "That's all right, old chap—you can sell on that property you acquired years ago from Scottish Homes". As the Bill stands, that could be taken as consent.<br><br>
What status will the written consent have? Will it be a public document, to which people have access? I do not want to overflow into the next interesting amendment, which I believe the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) intends to move. However, I should like to know whether tenants will have access to the information and whether they will have the opportunity to give consent to the onward disposal of their homes from the first-generation acquisitive landlord to another acquisitive landlord.<br><br>
I welcome the Minister's acceptance of the principle that such consent should be in writing, although I am a little disappointed that seals will not be appended to such documents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing magic about writing if it is not probative. That is a perfectly understood form of law. It is no good some wee Jessie in the office putting something in writing and claiming to bind someone to whom she has never spoken. The consent must be in a probative, written form. Leases could normally be proved by writ or oath, according to the common law—either by probative writing or by someone swearing that something was true—but any old writing will not do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It should preferably be legible, too. I am trying to give credit to the hon. Member for Eastwood. We are now a little further forward than we were when a nod and a wink from a member of the board of Scottish Homes could be deemed to be legally acceptable consent. At least there will be a piece of paper with writing on it.<br><br>
I was a little offended by the terminology used by the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross. He implied that something was not particularly important if it had been written by "some wee Jessie in the office". That sounds somewhat perjorative. The hon. and learned Gentleman could not get away with that kind of language in the Labour party, but I do not suppose that there is much possibility of him joining it. Something written by some wee Nicky
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0721">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1169</span>
would be equally unsatisfactory if it was not properly witnessed, signed and delivered—it could not be sealed, of course, because the idea of the seal has been rejected by the Minister. None the less, I take the hon. and learned Gentleman's point that a scruffy bit of paper with no particular status produced by a member of the board of Scottish Homes or an administrative official is not good enough. There is a case for having a properly executed legal document.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) proposed an ingenious way of getting around the problem. He suggested that a condition should be attached to the title deeds requiring any onward disposal of the property to be officially endorsed by Scottish Homes. As the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire remarked in wonder, "What a good idea!" My hon. Friend's suggestion was truly wonderful in its simplicity and accuracy. Such a provision could easily be written into the Bill. It would overcome the problems that Opposition Members have been dwelling on, and would also satisfy the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross. Whoever is involved, whether it be a wee Jessie or a wee Bill Walker, it would be better if the consent were executed legally. Tabs could then be kept on what was recently a public asset and will still benefit from public subsidy.<br><br>
I do not want to trawl through our earlier discusison about the fact that a landlord who acquires under the Bill will get a windfall gain because of the change in value, but the Minister acknowledges that that will happen. A landlord who acquires the property will receive a substantial subsidy from the public purse, so the public have a legitimate interest in what happens to that property. There is an overwhelming case for ensuring that Scottish Homes is informed about onward disposal, and that the public interest is taken into account before consent for onward disposal is granted. We are not talking about property that is built in the private sector without subsidies, but about houses that are built for the public with public money. They will be passed on to a private speculator with an indirect subsidy. He can then pass them on and make more money. That is why there should be controls and proper information.<br><br>
10.30 pm<br><br>
I agree with the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross that the provision for such consent being recorded is not sufficiently strong in the Bill or in amendment No. 334.I am not sure whether it would be better if it were decorated with a seal, but I remain attracted to the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South, and should like the benefit of the Minister's superior wisdom on the question of conveyancing. He flaunts the fact that he knows more about conveyancing than the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross, so perhaps he could say whether my hon. Friend for Aberdeen, South was right when he said that a simple way out of the problem would be to attach a condition to the title deeds when the property is first transferred to the acquiring landlord. That would ensure that any subsequent transactions are legally endorsed by Scottish Homes or by some other appropriate
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1170</span>
representative whose job it is to look after the public interests in respect of that property.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not share the technical expertise of my honourable and learned Friend the Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) on such terms as a "wee Jessie", but I have a fair idea what a big Jessie is.<br><br>
I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for accepting amendment No. 334, which has also been accepted by the Opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was a useful wind-up speech from a self-acknowledged big Jessie on the Conservative Back Benches but I live in hope that the Minister will respond to the interesting suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South and of the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire as it would be a much better way to deal with the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot respond while the hon. Gentleman is on his feet.<br><br>
Amendment No. 334 is a Law Society amendment, which I strongly commend. The Law Society has made many good representations and is glad that the matter has been taken up. I was asked whether the document will be public and the form that it will take. The document will be public, but it does not have to be in a specific form, so long as its issue is authorised properly by Scottish Homes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall get there eventually. My hon. Friend for Aberdeen, South suggested that the process could be dealt with more simply and more satisfactorily by attaching a condition to the relevant title deeds. Will the Minister confirm that that is possible?</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The trouble is that we are talking about different issues. In connection with the amendment, I am raising the useful suggestion put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South, which was endorsed by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire. It seems a wonderfully simple way of dealing with the problem. I do not know whether what we are getting now is dumb insolence or plain ignorance from the Minister, but it would be nice to have an answer. If not, his silence will be more eloquent than his speeches usually are.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My first thoughts on the hon. Gentleman's proposal is that it would not be practicable. I insist that I can only repeat what I have already said. The terms of amendment No. 334 are satisfactory.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The meaning of the amendment is blindingly simple. We have just discussed the insertion of a provision to enable consent to be left in the hands of Scottish Homes if further disposals are contemplated. The amendment seeks to stop onward transfers without the explicit consent of the tenant.<br><br>
It is difficult to embellish the argument because it is so straightforward and the meaning of the amendment is so clear. It is an important way of protecting tenants in the course of transfers at whatever level because the provision would apply not only to the first, second or third transfer, but would continue to apply in perpetuity, so long as the tenancy existed. That would be a cast-iron guarantee that the contemplated transfer was not inimical to the tenant's interests. I cannot see why the Government would have difficulty in accepting that proposition, as it would give a guarantee that no other technological or legal burden, or any other device, could provide.<br><br>
The Government will probably say that such a formula would not be administratively convenient, that it would restrain trade, that there is no precedent, or any of the other excuses that we have heard time without number on previous clauses. But I insist that it has the benefit of simplicity and requires no administrative bureaucracy.<br><br>
If the Government have any regard for tenants' interests, the amendment is an easy, straightforward way of guaranteeing those interests. I look forward to the Minister's response. There are no drafting difficulties, because the words are clear, self-explanatory and legally valid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Lord James Douglas-Hamilton.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I saw the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) rise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: After you.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is flattering that hon. Members wish to listen to me that badly.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 575 and 588 would give tenants who transferred to new landlords under tenants' choice an effective veto on the disposal of the property they occupy to another landlord. Although I accept that the wishes of tenants thus involved
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1172</span>
are extremely important, I should expect Scottish Homes, without any statutory obligation being placed on it, to have regard to tenants' views when it considers applications for approval, but I do not believe that that need be or should be enshrined in statute.<br><br>
I am even less attracted to amendment No. 541 which seeks to ensure that the Secretary of State will prescribe the manner in which landlords, who have acquired property under part III, must consult and inform tenants occupying the property before any application for consent to disposal of property can be approved by Scottish Homes. It would not be appropriate in my view for the Secretary of State to set down arrangements for the conduct of a sale between two non-public sector bodies in this way.<br><br>
I ask the hon. Member to withdraw the amendment otherwise I must ask the Committee to reject it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support amendment No. 588. It provides a statutory requirement for tenants to be consulted. The problem is that, once an approved landlord has acquired housing from the housing authority, the only condition attached to his disposal of a property is that he must have the consent of Scottish Homes.<br><br>
His tenants will have exercised their right to tenants' choice and opted out of their former SSHA or other public sector tenancy. However, as tenants of the approved landlord, all further rights to a say in their future will be non-existent. The Bill does not provide that they be consulted by Scottish Homes prior to it granting or refusing consent to their approved landlord if he or she wishes to dispose of their homes, nor does the Bill provide for tenants to choose another landlord if their existing landlord intends to dispose of the properties. Tenants do not have the right to be consulted on an existing landlord's choice of a new landlord for them.<br><br>
Shelter is particularly worried about the fact that the future landlord does not even have to be an approved landlord. I hope that Scottish Homes will impose strict conditions on the onward disposal of property and take reasonable steps to ensure that tenants are given a full say in their future. However, tenants will have no legal right to insist on consultation or to choose their future.<br><br>
If the tenants' choice provisions are intended to give people greater choice and control over their homes, such legal rights should be the foundation of the Government's policy. That is important not only for the protection of tenants' rights but for the future success of the tenants' choice provisions.<br><br>
As the Bill stands, the incentive for a public sector tenant to opt out in favour of a private landlord is small. He or she will become an assured tenant, have no right to buy, few succession rights, face higher rents and have no guarantee of the management standards offered. Without this amendment, tenants will have no rights and no knowledge of whether the chosen landlord will be a permanent landlord or merely someone in the business of making a small, short-term killing. The approved landlord may dispose of properties as quickly as he can, with the connivance of Scottish Homes and behind the

tenant's back, to another landlord who may not be acceptable to the tenant.<br><br>
10.45 pm<br><br>
Shelter believes that tenants will face a problem that will be detrimental to the Bill as the Government see it. In spite of any promised improvements in the quality of the home, such as repairs and management, the tenant may be put off by the severe disadvantages of becoming an assured tenant. The property may not remain in the hands of the landlord that the tenant approves of and with whom he has signed a contract, but may end up in the hands of someone whom the tenant does not know and who may not care about the tenant or the long-term future of the property. Shelter firmly believes that it is in the Government's interest to make the tenants' choice as attractive an option as possible, and that means offering tenants a real choice and not a bogus choice.<br><br>
Amendment No. 588, which Shelter drafted, will make little difference to the landlord because, if he is a truly responsible landlord, he would wish to involve his tenants in the crucial decisions on the disposal of their homes. However, Shelter believes—we agree—that it will make a crucial difference to tenants to know that legally they have a right to demand that their landlord consult them about any transfer to another landlord.<br><br>
Shelter believes that the public sector tenant, faced with the decision whether to exercise tenants' choice, is more likely to opt for a new landlord if he is armed with the knowledge that the property will not be passed to an undesirable landlord. If that provision remains in the Bill, opting for a new landlord will be less attractive to tenants seeking tenancies and will lead to those empty houses that the Minister could not number remaining empty for considerably longer. Shelter believes that this amendment is crucial to the Bill if tenants are to be offered true choice and control over their homes and choice of landlord.<br><br>
The Scottish Consumer Council has discussed amendment No. 541 with us and has put forward similar arguments. In supporting amendment No. 541, we concur with the Scottish Consumer Council that it is necessary to give tenants of property which is subsequently disposed of by their previous landlord the right to be informed and make representations to their landlord about such transactions.<br><br>
Although private sector tenants do not enjoy rights to information or consultation about a change of landlord, there is a special case for establishing such rights in a new and pioneering Bill to give tenants in properties formerly under public ownership the right to be consulted about any subsequent transfers. That is particularly important when landlords take over property en bloc, and then form a contract with the new tenants.<br><br>
When deciding whether to give consent to disposal, Scottish Homes should have regard to the tenants' views. The Scottish Consumer Council believes that amendment No. 541 will provide such a safeguard. The regulations could specify how tenants should be consulted and how their views should be made known to the Secretary of State. For example, Scottish Homes might wish to know the tenants' views about
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1174</span>
proposed changes in the lease, management services or other arrangements arising from the subsequent disposal of the property.<br><br>
They are all important rights for tenants whom the government wish to entice into switching their landlords, to whom they will then give carte blanche to hand over the tenants.<br><br>
Other problems arise from the Government's failure to take account of the need to protect tenants from exploitation. It is ironic that, at the same time as the amendments from Shelter and the Scottish Consumer Council seek to extend tenants' rights to be consulted, the Government seek to constrict those rights. Many councils have long histories of giving tenants more say and they are now giving them more than ever before in running their affairs. Edinburgh is not unique in giving tenants the opportunity to choose their landlords. In Bingham, Edinburgh district council was chosen by tenants to demolish and rebuild their houses. Tenants were also involved with the architects and had the final say in the plans and building of the 250 houses in Bingham.<br><br>
If the Government refuse to accept the amendments, tenants' right to discuss their future with their landlords will be removed. If Labour introduced a Bill which allowed councils to hand over their houses to any Rachman without consulting tenants, the Conservative party would be the first to object, and rightly so. The problem is that the safeguards that the Minister believes are enshrined in the Bill will no longer apply when the second and subsequent transfer of property takes place. The only rationale for a second and subsequent transfer is the bankruptcy of the landlord or a similar misfortune, for which we tried to cater in an earlier amendment, or because the landlord wants to make a quick killing out of the property and hand it on to another landlord who may be similary motivated. That is not the way to run a sensible housing policy. Instead of enhancing people' rights, it removes them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend speaks about a sensible housing policy. If he suggests that the Government are trying to operate a sensible housing policy, he is founding his argument on a false premise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The night is young. The Minister and his colleagues will have many hours to rethink their housing policy. If we take another six or eight hours to get through the Bill, we will have given five hours more thought to it than the Government gave to the initial drafting.<br><br>
Amendment No. 535 tabled by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood), and amendments Nos. 588 and 541 concentrate on the need to establish rights for tenants or write established rights into the Bill. Tenants in Scotland have fought for well nigh a century for the rights that they enjoy today. They have the right to consult the council and other rights which are enshrined in law, but which the Government do not pursue as vigorously such as the right to repair. The Government have given almost no assistance in establishing rights of repair. They are removing the tenants' right to be consulted about their future.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0724">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1175</span>
Clause 60 should come as no surprise because in Edinburgh the Conservative council wanted to take over the West Pilton estate lock, stock and barrel and hand it over to property developers with £3 million worth of 90 per cent. repairs grant that should have gone to home owners in my constituency. The Conservative council working with the Secretary of State took that decision without consulting the tenants.<br><br>
These three amendments and others that we have tabled try to get to the heart of the matter. We wish to ensure that rights of tenants which have taken decades to establish are enshrined in the new Bill. Even the rights that private sector tenants enjoyed before are not being enhanced. They are being diminished. The Government's refusal to accept the amendments displays the rationale that has brought housing in Scotland to its knees. The Government's rationale is that the market must decide, not the tenants. The key issue is whether we believe that tenants should have a right to a say in their housing and conditions, and subsequent changes to them or whether changes should be decided behind their backs by a quango appointed by the Secretary of State and a bunch of profiteers.<br><br>
The Government's proposals are not democratic. There are no ballots and no statutory consultation with tenants. Will the Minister assure us that he will accept the amendments?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I feel humbled following my hon. Friend's tour de force. I shall be briefer, and find a wee bit more entertainment for the Minister's advisers.<br><br>
The amendments deal with our worries about tenants' rights. In most tenancies there is a spouse. The Minister will be well aware of the terms of the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (SCOTLAND) Act. What consideration has been given to that? That Act created a fairly fundamental right for the spouse of a tenant—the occupancy right. My main experience of the occupancy right is in relation to the transfer of property. Building societies, solicitors and so on have created sophisticated devices to deal with the occupancy right. On purchase, each spouse will sign an affidavit relinquishing his other occupancy right. It may be written into the title deed. It will be part of a standard security. Occupancy rights exist in relation to tenancies too.<br><br>
11 pm<br><br>
These amendments relate to the applicability of the tenants' consent. I should be interested to hear the Minister's comments on the application of that Act not to the amendments but to the Bill as a whole. The Minister wants to break down the barriers and improve the flow of property on to the market and he has obviously decided that that is to be done by removing tenants' rights, but the Bill does not mention the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (SCOTLAND) 1981 Act at all. What consideration has the Minister given to the terms of that Act?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's response to the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1176</span>
Kirkwood) was very brief. Is he working on the principle that the less he says the less chance of making another gaff? What he said was very unsatifactory. Although he conceded that the views of the tenants were important, he made it clear that they were not that important to him. He will allow private sector landlords to collude in the disposal of a house and the tenant along with it without any consultation with the tenant about that disposal. He mentioned that Scottish Homes would be able to take the tenants' interests into consideration, but that would only apply under the first disposal. Scottish Homes would not approve the landlord in any subsequent disposal and so no consideation would be taken of the tenants' views.<br><br>
I draw the Minister's attention to the information paper which I suppose he authorised to be issued in conjunction with the Bill. It is entitled "Tenants' Choice", and subtitled "A Right for Public Sector Tenants to Choose New Landlords". On page 2 it states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Tenants' choice will be exactly what the name indicates. The new arrangements will apply only to tenants who wish to change their landlords, while remaining in the same house or flat."</p></blockquote>
The debate on this group of amendments shows that to be pure humbug. The tenants here are getting a new landlord without even being consulted. If the Minister allows the clause to go through as it stands it will be possible for two private sector landlords, without even asking the tenant, to discuss the transfer of a house and the tenant with it. It is almost as if the tenant is a chattel attached to the house. It is like the old days of serfdom when the Minister's forefathers, the Dukes of Hamilton, would dispose of chattels in this manner every day. The Minister is now bringing forward legislation which will recreate that situation in Scotland, much to his disgrace.<br><br>
The Minister must consider the fundamental issue of consulting tenants about what they think is right and proper to happen to them and the house they live in. The tenant may not own the house but he may live in it throughout his life and so think of it as his home. We are talking about people's homes being disposed of without their consent or any consideration of their views. For the tenants the pick-a-landlord scheme will have both advantages and disadvantages. There are great disadvantages. They will lose the security of tenure which they enjoy inside the public sector. They will become assured tenants and thus lose many of the present rights, such as succession to the tenancy, protection against eviction and so on. They will also be subject to much higher rents—to market rents which will have to be negotiated with the new private sector landlord. The advantage to be balanced against that is possible modernisation work which the district councils could not carry out because the Government have been keeping money from them to prevent them from carrying out the modernisation work they want to do.<br><br>
Into that balance of advantage and disadvantage the tenant must add a further disadvantage. Should he agree to choose a new private sector landlord, he will sign away any control that he might have over who will be his future landlord. Once he has opted for a private sector landlord, that landlord can pass
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0725">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1177</span>
him on to someone else who can pass him on again. There can be various changes of landlord and ownership over which the tenant has no control. For the Minister to pretend to be the tenants' friend and the defender of their rights when he is promoting a clause like this is an absolute disgrace.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) mentioned the example that had been set by district councils consulting tenants on everything which affects them. It is implied in the Government's information paper that district councils are very poor landlords, and that tenants may have a whole series of complaints against their district council, such as, for example, serious cumulative disrepair. Tenants are rightly concerned about that, but it is the fault not of the district council but of the Government and the Minister in particular. He is advocating a cut in capital allocation to Dundee district council. I hope that we can persuade him not to implement that and, instead, to increase the allocation. There are also complaints about the standard of maintenance and response time to deal with complaints. It is even said that some tenants complain that their district council charges them an unrealistically low rent. Can he give us any evidence of that? Can he provide some names and addresses of tenants who think they are paying too little?<br><br>
The Minister implies that district councils are poor landlords, that they do not take their tenants' priorities into consideration. Nothing could be further from the truth. District councils are setting an example for everyone else in housing, and showing how to take tenants with them in modernisation programmes, in day-to-day repairs, in maintenance and the way in which their schemes are run. They consult the tenants about everything. They listen to what the tenants want and they try to provide it within the restraints imposed by the Government's cash cuts. It is time that the Minister followed the example of the district councils instead of trying to open up the market for his friends in the private sector. I hope that when he replies to the debate he will say a lot more than he said at the beginning because that was totally unsatisfactory and did not justify the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the contributions from my hon. Friends the Members for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) and for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths), in view of their recent experience as members of elected local authorities in Scotland. The point that both my hon. Friends have made about the practices of Scottish district councils as landlords is entirely appropriate. I can just imagine the rammy if a district council proposed to sell off tenants' houses over their heads to some other owner without consulting the tenant. The hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) would complain to the editor of <i>The Sunday Times</i> and make representations. The next thing would be that No. 10 Downing Street would be involved and orders would be introduced under some obscure, unheard of legislation to take powers for the Secretary of State to intervene to protect those tenants—and rightly so.<br><br>
The Minister repeatedly says that some district councils are disposing of some of their housing stock.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1178</span>
Those are the notorious district councils that are supposed to be such appalling landlords and are not prepared to diversify their housing stock or entertain any change in their areas. According to the Minister's analysis, these councils make the legislation necessary. Glasgow district council is disposing of some stock to the Scottish Special Housing Association which will eventually become Scottish Homes. However, I have no doubt that that has been done with the consent of the tenants. I cannot imagine an elected local authority in Scotland discussing the transfer of houses to another landlord—either in the private sector or in the public sector—without consulting the tenants. That would be shocking.<br><br>
It is interesting that we are holding the discussion in the context of part III, which the Minister sees fit to describe as the "tenants' choice" section of the Bill. What "choice" is there for tenants? They will be trapped into transferring their house from the public sector to an uncertain future in the private sector. At least, until the last minute, tenants can veto the transaction. However, as soon as it has been completed and the house is acquired by an approved landlord, an assured tenancy is established and all rights are gone. Within hours of the completion of that transaction the approved landlord may sell the property to another company or some other approved landlord without the tenant's knowledge. The tenant could find himself in negotiation with an entirely different landlord. What tenant will choose to get involved in that series of transactions?<br><br>
The Minister has exposed the most deplorable nature of this part of the Bill, yet he has the brass neck to try to dismiss the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood).<br><br>
He said that it is unacceptable because it would establish a tenant's veto against onward disposal of the property. I am glad that the Minister intervened, because he established beyond question that the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire is absolutely perfect. It achieves exactly what the Opposition want to achieve. It would give the tenant an effective veto over any further transaction involving the roof over his own and his family's heads. What on earth is wrong with that?<br><br>
Amendment No. 541 was drafted by the Scottish Consumer Council and would require the Secretary of State to prescribe the manner of consultations with tenants about disposals of properties. The Minister said that that would be bureaucratic, a bad thing and a monstrous interference in the freedom of private sector landlords to do what they like with other people's houses. We have come to expect that sort of thing from the Government, but Minister might have had the grace to show a little shame, or even contrition. He says that the Opposition are wrong to suggest that a tenant should be consulted about—and able to scrutinise the details of—the disposal of his home within the private sector, perhaps within hours of the initial disposal.</span></p>
