<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 20, in clause 2, page 2, line 17, after 'Homes', insert
<br><blockquote><p>'after consultation with the appropriate housing authority or authorities for the area or areas in which housing developments or projects are proposed'.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>No. 24, in clause 2, page 3, line 15, at end, insert
<br><blockquote><p><i>'(c)</i> in subsections <i>(2)(e), (f), (g), (h), (k), (m)</i> so far as they relate to the acquisition or disposal of land not previously developed for the building of houses may be exercised only after consultation with the Local Authority in the District where a service is to be provided or land is situated.'.</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson <span class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I recap briefly on the debate on amendment No. 7, which seeks to establish the point that elected local authorities will take the lead in determining housing policy for their local neighbourhoods. The question had arisen whether the new Scottish Homes quango nominated by the Secretary of State for Scotland would end up determining housing policy in the districts and islands. The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland said that everything would be all right on the day and that he did not want to shackle local authorities to Scottish Homes. He quoted his favourite White Paper to argue that the Government's intentions were entirely above board and reasonable and that everything would be sweetness and light.<br><br>
The Opposition have their doubts about the provision. We have made it clear that the Labour party believes in local democracy and believes that the local authority should give the lead in these functions, if necessary with the back-up and co-ordination of the research and funding of Scottish Homes.<br><br>
I want to put the Under-Secretary of State on the spot. Can he tell us which body he believes will give the lead and initiate housing policy in the districts in Scotland? Will it be the local authorities, as is the present statutory position, or will it be Scottish Homes? In case the Under-Secretary tries to find a form of words to get out of that, can he tell us who will get the housing budget in future? That is the crucial issue. Who will spend the money? Will the district and islands housing associations continue to get the public sector budget to support private sector housing and to provide public sector housing in their areas, or do the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 88</span>
Government intend to take that budget away, either immediately or by stages, from the housing authorities and give it to Scottish Homes? It would be useful if the Minister could give us some information on that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asked which would be the lead body. The answer is that it depends on circumstances. In certain cases it would be the local authority; in others it would be Scottish Homes. It would depend very much on the project.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Give us some examples.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give the hon. Gentleman an example. In the summer, when I was in Coatbridge and Airdrie, I visited the Jimmy Dempsie home. The hon. Gentleman will remember Jimmy Dempsie, who was a popular Member of the House. That was a local authority project in which housing for the disabled was constructed extremely well and named after him. But in other cases, where there might be an urgent need for housing for the disabled, Scottish Homes might be able to fund it. It depends upon the priorities and needs in the area and would be a matter for negotiation.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) asked earlier what exceptions there could be to consultation. I cannot be exhaustive, but I want to give him two possible examples. One is the promotion of community business, where there is no need for automatic consultation. Another is in environmental improvement. For example if the developer or housing association were involved in a project and there was some tidying up to be done, the local authority sub-committees would not necessarily have to be involved. It is a matter of common sense. It might be a courtesy to inform the local authority and keep it in the picture, but I do not see it as a requirement that needs to be written into the Bill. Those are only two examples, but I am sure that there are other minor examples along similar lines.<br><br>
The Opposition have doubted the sincerity of the Government's intentions towards partnership. The partnership will certainly depend on willing co-operation. Legislating for consultation in all circumstances is not the same as legislating for partnership. Partnership consists in the spirit of the dealings between bodies, not merely the letter of the law. The amendments cannot make the partnership work, but they may introduce cumbersome and unnecessary formality into Scottish Homes for dealings with local authorities. I recommend to the hon. Gentleman that he withdraw the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood <span class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: What happens if the partnership breaks down? Is there any provision in the Bill giving the Secretary of State powers to resolve that problem?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is speaking vaguely. It would depend upon the circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am taking my lead from the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We must be able to respond flexibly to circumstances as they arise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Are there powers in the Bill to allow the Secretary of State to put right a breakdown in communications between Scottish Homes and the local authority housing departments?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0129">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 89</span>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Under the present arrangements it is perfectly competent for the Scottish Office to issue a code of guidance if it is necessary in certain circumstances. I envisage that Scottish Homes will work just as successfully and closely with local authorities as the Scottish Special Housing Association and the Housing Corporation have done. There are no statutory requirements at present written into the law for the Housing Corporation and the SSHA to consult. They do so as a matter of common sense, and I expect them to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is being helpful, and I appreciate the spirit in which he is responding to the points made by the Opposition. I understand him to suggest that the Government will have recourse to what he called notes of guidance, or some guideline procedures, if they believe that it is not working properly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, if it is necessary. Certainly in the case of the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977 a code of guidance was issued for local authorities, and I understand that it has been considered helpful. There are possibilities along those lines, should the need arise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But it is not a mandatory decision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not mandatory for the Scottish Office, I understand, to issue codes of guidance. If the need arises, we would issue them, or measures along those lines.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This started almost as a probing amendment. I did not want to go to the wall on consultation, because like everybody else I assumed that such consultation would take place; but in introducing the amendments I asked the Minister which was to be the lead housing authority in the districts of Scotland, assuming that he would reply that it would be the district or islands councils. That is the statutory position at present. Initiation of any housing project is undertaken by the district council or the islands council. In my naivety, I assumed that the Minister would confirm that that would continue to be the case, but he has done nothing of the sort. He has dug himself into a bit of a hole, because he has confirmed all sorts of nasty suspicions and doubts which were lurking in the back of our minds that there might be scope for Scottish Homes to take over all those horrors, and for the initiation power in housing to be transferred from district councils to Scottish Homes. That is rather disturbing.<br><br>
The Minister says that there would be consultation, that everything would work out on the day, that people would discuss with each other and that it would all make sense. We have had experience of concurrent powers in local government in Scotland. I am thinking of powers to provide recreational and environmental facilities which were concurrent between district and regional authorities. That caused much confusion and potential duplication, and not long ago the Government amended the legislation. The other case was tourist promotion, all of which has subsequently been concentrated in the hands of district councils, and removed from the regions. Here we go again. Two sets of authorities, district and islands councils on the one hand and Scottish Homes on the other, will have concurrent statutory powers in housing. There is scope for conflict and difficulties in that.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 90</span>
There is also the curious question, which I have tried to explore with the Minister, of who at the end of the day will have the power. There must be a genuine fear, especially with the minority administration in the Scottish Office, which is frequently in conflict with local authorities, that it might decide to load the equation and deprive the local authorities of the wherewithal to exercise those powers, and to ensure that in future housing decisions are taken by people whom the Secretary of State has appointed and who will be running Scottish Homes.<br><br>
Far from the general point which I have made here being a probing amendment, simply seeking information, we may have got ourselves into a discussion on a point of principle on which the Committee should vote.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I add to what I said to the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire? The Secretary of State has wider powers under the legislation. Clause 4(9) says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may give Scottish Homes directions of a general or specific character."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is what happened in Lanarkshire.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is important that they work closely in co-operation and partnership. The questions asked by the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) are based on a misguided conception. We are not talking about a master-servant relationship. I refer to the legal language. Initiatives will come from both sides. I remind him of what Lord Carrington said at the United Nations. We want a success, not a victory. It does not matter where a good idea comes from. If it is a good idea and can be implemented, I hope that it will be worked out successfully.<br><br>
It is not true to say that all housing projects are initiated by local authorities. The Housing Corporation and the SSHA take initiatives, as will Scottish Homes. It will be a continuation of what happens now, but in a larger, stronger body.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is one of my favourite constituents, and a very nice man, but he is not at his most convincing this afternoon. It is important that the Committee should have an opportunity to put down a clear marker that local authorities should at the very least have a statutory right to be consulted. In effect, we should reaffirm the fact that an elected local authority should be the lead authority in determining housing decisions in its area, without any scope for overriding by Scottish Homes. We have not had reassurance on either point. In the circumstances, I invite my hon. Friends to support the amendment.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p>4.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a matter of great regret to us that there is no mention in any of the 67 pages of the Bill of the need for training and education, particularly as it was drawn to the Secretary of State's attention and as the need for further training has been a keen topic of discussion in housing for at least 10 years. It does not augur well for the Bill that training does not rate a mention. The amendment seeks to rectify the omission.<br><br>
The Scottish Housing Training Advisory Board specifically made representations on this matter at the White Paper stage, and I am sorry that the Government could not incorporate its valuable comments in the Bill. In 1977, a report sponsored by the Scottish Development Department highlighted the shortage of professionally trained housing staff in Scottish local authorities and recommended an expansion of training provision. Since 1980 the Scottish Training Unit has existed to promote and encourage education and training at all levels. In 1985, the Institute of Housing published a report which showed a continuing shortage of housing professionals and a lack of commitment to and resources in housing.<br><br>
The consequences of this shortage are plain for all to see in the efficiency and the quality of the service. Less than 10 per cent. of housing staff had a housing qualification, either at a professional or, just as seriously, at a technical level. The Scottish Special Housing Association, which has provided fully qualified professionals to influence, guide and indeed permeate the Scottish housing scene, may lose that remit. Indeed, the Bill does not appear to give it any such remit.<br><br>
The Institute of Housing is worried that no mention is made of the way in which Scottish Homes can continue to provide a pool of expertise and expresses concern about the future quality of Scottish housing management and provision. It is particularly worried that, unless specific proposals are formulated—we believe that the amendment gives us a remit to do that—the SSHA's educational and training role is unlikely to be continued.<br><br>
We know that the SSHA and the Housing Corporation in Scotland make financial contributions to the Scottish Training Unit. Again the Bill does not seem to recognise that or to make firm proposals for such contributions to continue.<br><br>
The Government have made much of the apparent ability of tenants to choose. The Opposition seek to give tenants real choices in housing and, in particular, the statutory right to good quality housing at a price that they can afford. It is sad that the Bill will not offer to tenants'
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 92</span>
groups, smaller housing associations and others education and training on options open to them, and the best way to proceed with what they want.<br><br>
The Government must take note of the need for proper education and training provision in Scottish Homes. They must make provision for the continuation of the constructive role of the SSHA and its trained professional staff, as well at the professionals now available to many of our local authorities. They must also ensure that current housing organisations and new landlords whom the Government seek to bring into being are prepared for the continuing changes in housing provision in Scotland.<br><br>
The Government have not been overgenerous in funding—<i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I ask hon. Members to keep their conversations at a lower level. Another hon. Member is making a speech and we can hear nothing at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting to see some of these people in the Room, Mr. Martin. It is an unusual sight, and I am perhaps more tolerant of them than you are.<br><br>
The Government have been parsimonious in providing for training, and the Institute of Housing has had to support the training unit; the Joseph Rowntree Memorial Trust has had to put in funds, and local authorities, new town development corporations, the SSHA and the Housing Corporation have a voluntary levy on them because of the Government's failure to make a substantial and necessary contribution to the funding of training and education. The importance of training cannot be overstressed.<br><br>
The recent inquiry into housing in Glasgow, chaired by Professor Grieve, reached a firm conclusion that
<br><blockquote><p>"poor housing management practices … have contributed significantly to the social malaise in many areas of local authority housing in the city".</p></blockquote>
The report also recommended that
<br><blockquote><p>"staff training continues to be a high priority, linked to academic institutions and professional courses".</p></blockquote>
If the new housing agency is to achieve effective improvements in housing management throughout Scotland, it should have a clear remit to promote and provide high quality training. This will be of special importance to those smaller authorities, smaller housing associations and new housing associations with limited management resources and access to training. The expansion of tenant involvement in the management of their own homes, which the Labour party has promoted for a long time, must be supplemented with specialist training. Scottish Homes will be in a position to identify the training needs and assess how they can be best met.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn <span class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and Kinross)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: "Tenant involvement with training needs"—what on earth does that rubbish mean?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will give the hon. and learned Gentleman a practical example, which the Secretary of State will appreciate because it comes from a newsletter that circulates in his constituency. That states that the Secretary of State—whose generosity I must commend—has been assisting Lothian regional council in the sort of training of which the hon. and learned Gentleman wants details. Together with the regional and district councils, and the Wester Hailes representative council, it has been supporting a forum of tenants and other organisations which operate in the Secretary of State's
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0131">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 93</span>
constituency. So much have they profited from the education, advisory workers, weekend courses and seminars on how to ensure that local and central Government are responsive to council tenants' needs in a large estate such as Wester Hailes that they have said no to Scottish Homes. Indeed, the chairman of that group, Mr. Stan Taylor, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We see Scottish Homes leading to much higher rents, less security of tenure and an increase in real poverty."</p></blockquote>
Sadly, they do not leave it there. They have educated themselves to a high degree. As Mr. Taylor said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We have invited Malcolm Rifkind, our MP to come and explain the proposals, but he has repeatedly declined to do so."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McAllion <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in the question put to my hon. Friend by the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn). If he had attended the Committee more regularly, he would have been aware that the Minister has argued consistently, since the Committee began, in favour of setting up par value coops. It would be impossible to set up such co-ops without providing training facilities for their members to take over the management of the building from the district councils. That would have been in line with the Government's thinking, but the hon. Gentleman may be out of line with the Government's thinking.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is disgraceful double-think and double-talk on the part of the Government and their supporters. I have digressed slightly from the amendment; but steeped in fiction as the hon. and learned Gentleman is—I understand that he has just written a book—and because of his rare appearances, Opposition Members may be able to educate him a little in the feelings and moods of tenants. That feeling is equally hostile to many aspects of the Bill, but the tenants, like the housing professionals, disappointed as they are in the lack of emphasis upon training and education, look forward to the Minister's accepting our reasoned amendment on the matter, and the further amendment which would assist in promoting and providing funding for training and research and development.<br><br>
The importance of research and development in housing cannot be overstressed. We are all aware that Governments and councils of various party complexions have built some housing disasters. Sadly, too many of them have been built with all-party support and no opposition. For that, all politicians should share a deep regret. We need—the Bill is deficient in this—a mechanism and funds to make sure that mistakes of the past are not repeated. The best way to do that is to ensure that funding is given to the appropriate bodies.<br><br>
We shall be happy to continue to support the independent bodies, as we always have done, to carry out research and training, making sure that the lessons of this country and others are learnt. We know that the cost of rectifying the defects is terrible. We shall debate further amendments, which will show that whatever the political cost has been, the cost to individuals who live in houses where there was inadequate research or forethought has been dire and horrendous, for which everyone involved in the building of them should feel guilty.<br><br>
I conclude by seeking all-party support. The amendments should not be controversial. All hon.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 94</span>
Members should wish to promote education, training and research. I look forward to the Minister accepting the amendments.</span></p>
<p>5 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) and to his theme on the importance of educational training, research and development and of high quality training. I take issue with him when he says that the Government have been parsimonious in this respect.<br><br>
The Institute of Housing's training unit, to which he referred, came about at the instigation of the Government, backed by the offer of financial assistance. A large proportion of its costs have consistently been met by grant from the Scottish Development Department.<br><br>
It is to the Institute of Housing's credit that it has sought additional funding elsewhere for an expansion of its activities. That is not a reflection on the Government. The Institute of Housing has not sought funding exclusively from the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the Muir report recommended the establishment of a Scottish Housing training council with the remit to give help and guidance to housing organisations on the content, quality and presentation of their staff training and on the system of defining maintenance and standards of formal training for housing management, why was that training council not set up? It was substituted in 1980 by the Institute of Housing's Scottish training unit with a much narrower remit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that, by the time I conclude my remarks, I shall have given the hon. Member an answer. In the meantime, I make the further point that the Government also fund, through the Housing Corporation, the valuable training functions of the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations.<br><br>
The answer to the question asked by the hon. Gentleman a moment ago is that the institute's unit seemed a better way to achieve results, as its great success has proved.<br><br>
The Government's commitment to Scottish Homes having a useful role to play in training and in research and development is clear. It is stated explicitly at paragraph 2.10 of the White Paper:
<br><blockquote><p>"It will have an important research and development role and will be able to arrange the provision of other forms of agency services, for example in relation to the need for an expansion of training which a number of respondents identified."</p></blockquote>
Consequently, my only quarrel with the amendments is in terms of the drafting of the Bill. Training and research and development are both means rather than ends. As amendment No. 17 implicitly recognises in relation to training, clause 1 is concerned with ends. If amendments such as these have any place in the Bill, it is in clause 2.<br><br>
I appreciate that what I have said could be construed as an invitation to hon. Gentlemen to table amendments to clause 2. If I may do so without stepping out of order, it may be helpful if I say that in my view clause 2 is adequate as it is drafted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All Opposition Members say how nice the Minister is, but he should not push his niceness to the extent that he thinks that he can get away with murder when speaking in the Committee. What he was suggesting was very unclear.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0132">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 95</span>
First, he suggested that if these amendments were tabled to clause 2, they would be more beneficial. Then he said that clause 2 was not subject to amendment. It is a "Catch 22" situation.<br><br>
I support the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths), because the notes on clauses for subsection (3) say that clause 1 is drafted in very wide terms and covers the general functions of Scottish Homes. These functions include providing housing, helping to provide finance for housing and promoting housing associations. Why do these functions not include encouraging and promoting education and training for housing management staff?<br><br>
The Minister rightly pointed out that the White Paper made it clear that the key function of Scottish Homes would be to expand training, as had been identified by a number of respondents during the consultative process. If it was the intention to do that in the White Paper, why is it not included in the Bill? The Minister has not answered that.<br><br>
It would be foolish of the Committee to underestimate the importance of this subject. Since the abolition of the Scottish Housing Advisory Committee in 1980, there has been a lack of national guidance on the complex issues which surround housing management.<br><br>
Quality training for those involved in housing management is the essence of good housing. In the distant past some local authorities did not pay sufficient attention to this important matter. All hon. Members with public housing in their constituencies know that some local authorities used to promote to inspectors joiners who were approaching the end of their career with the public works department. Those men, although they were worthy and their contribution was important, did not know how to handle the public, complaints about repairs or queries about rents. This led to conflict between the tenants and housing officials and made people unsatisfied with the service that they received from the local authority. It is important to try to overcome that problem. Many local authorities have already provided in-service training to try to train existing staff to handle the public more competently and relate better to the problems that occur.<br><br>
This matter cuts across not only local authorities, but small housing associations which control only a small number of houses and have a small staff. They do not have the resources to allocate to the training of their staff. It is important to give them assistance by an agency such as Scottish Homes. That applies equally to small local authorities with very few houses under their management.<br><br>
It applies equally to larger local authorities. In Dundee, the Cleghorn housing association has about 500 houses and 23 staff to manage them. The Happy Hillock sub-office of the housing division in Dundee looks after 9,500 houses with 22 staff. In all the bodies that provide housing there is a need to encourage education and training and to improve the quality of the service that is available to tenants. The need is crucial because of the new measures in the Bill, where tenants are being encouraged to take on new types of tenure such as owner-occupation and all par value co-ops.<br><br>
It is insufficient for the Minister to point towards what has been done already by the Institute of Housing and to rely on the local authority to find the resources to meet those training needs. Something must be done by Scottish
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 96</span>
Homes. The Minister promised that in the White Paper; he has not delivered it in the Bill. He must explain to the Committee why that is so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is something unreal about finding oneself at loggerheads with the Under-Secretary of State. He seems to be getting some unhelpful briefing material or directions from people who are unseen in the Committee. It is not good enough for him to say that something in the White Paper covers the points made in the debate and then to say that he has been advised that he must resist the amendments tabled by Opposition Members and others.<br><br>
I accept and agree with what the White Paper says on the subject. It should be an important function of Scottish Homes to provide training for professionals involved in housing management and for tenants who may be involved in co-operatives, housing associations or other joint activities to promote tenant participation. All members of the Committee, with the possible exception of the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn), believe that what my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) is suggesting is worthwhile. But it is not good enough to say that there is some pious injunction in the White Paper when we are considering the framework of legislation. If there is no specific reference to Scottish Homes having a duty to support a training programme for the benefit of people involved either in providing houses or in running tenants' organisations, there is a potentially dangerous gap.<br><br>
Opposition Members do not want to vote against the Government on every detail of the Bill. It would be useful if a consensus could emerge on such subjects. Far be it from me to advise my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South on what he should do with the amendment that he has moved. The Minister could help himself and the Committee if he gave a reasonable and clear undertaking that provision would be made and that he was prepared to introduce an amendment, if not later in the Bill, on Report, to deal with the apparently genuine gap in the provisions of the Bill. We could then all make headway. But if he continues to block everything in an uncharacteristically unreasonable manner, he will run into trouble with the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The White Paper gives a clear commitment that Scottish Homes will give ample attention to training and to research and development. There is no disagreement in the Committee about the purpose of the amendments. We consider that the powers in clause 2 are adequate, but both hon. Members for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) and for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) have expressed concern, and I will look again to see whether there is any room for doubt that the provisions are adequate. I cannot give a guarantee that there will be an amendment on Report, but I will look at it again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support what has been said by Opposition Members, and the Minister appears to have recognised the burden of the argument. It would be helpful to have some expression in the Bill to reflect what I suspect is the unanimous view of the Committee.<br><br>
Who can be against training and education in this area? It is one that is developing very fast. Many of the Government's own proposals are fairly novel and potentially interesting. But if one is serious about tenants
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0133">Image</span>

having real management control over their own housing stock and areas, that will not happen overnight. One cannot expect lay persons, men in the street, who are busy doing other jobs and looking after their own domestic affairs, suddenly—<i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is unfair to an hon. Member who is making a contribution to the debate for others to be involved in loud conversations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your protection, Mr. Martin. I do not wish to overdo it, but it is an important point.<br><br>
If people are to be given authority and power over their own housing, which I support in terms of a housing cooperative, it cannot be expected to happen overnight. Support, resources, professional guidance, education and training must be given in quite large measure initially.<br><br>
One of my concerns is reflected in the amendments, which I support. It is that initially, certainly, if there is to be real progress, even in the way that the Government seek to achieve it, many professional people will be needed. I do not think that there are the professionally qualified bodies on the ground at present, even if the Government had the resources to put behind them, and one of the key functions of Scottish Homes must be to seize the initiative and provide the back-up and resources that people need in order to acquire professional expertise in this exciting area. If the Government did that, they would achieve the success that they deserve. Conversely, if they do not do it but expect it to happen by itself, without paying proper attention to resources and education and training, it will fall flat on its face. That is not in the Government's interest, either.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I give an undertaking to reconsider the matter and to keep the hon. Gentleman's points in mind.,</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to press the Minister, but it is important that he should spell out what he has in mind, if not now, later on in writing.<br><br>
The suggestion that clause 2 deals with all these needs opens up intriguing possibilities. One wonders whether it is the word "incidental" in line 2 of the clause, which tends to reflect the Government's approach, or "make such charge" in page 3, line 1, which reflects another approach, or "accept any gift" in line 4 that the Minister means. We do not want to leave it to that sort of chance. If the Minister gives an assurance that he will put in writing the commitment to provide and expand training under Scottish Homes, that may go some way to persuading us.</span></p>
<p>5.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no doubt that the commitment in the White Paper will be honoured, but I will look at the point that has been made to see what is the most appropriate method of dealing with it at a later stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister write to my hon. Friend?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be happy to write to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the Minister's assurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 98</span>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 102, in page 2, line 3, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>'having due regard to disadvantaged groups;'.</p></blockquote>
This is a probing amendment, which I hope the Committee will be able to deal with briefly. It has been put forward by the Scottish Council for the Single Homeless, which has suggested that a duty should be imposed on Scottish Homes in connection with its general function of
<br><blockquote><p>"promoting the provision and improvement of the housing and the improvement of management of housing (whether by its occupants or otherwise)"</p></blockquote>
to include an obligation to have proper regard for disadvantaged groups in Scotland. By that I mean not only the usual categories of disadvantaged people such as mentally ill or elderly people—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Socialists.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. and learned Gentleman finds this amusing. Many of us are anxious to make adequate housing provision for elderly or mentally ill people and for all manner of disadvantaged people in Scotland, and I hope that he will treat the subject seriously, as most other members of the Committee do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Nowhere provides for the disadvantaged better than Perth and Kinross in our schemes for the aged, the disadvantaged and the mentally handicapped. There is nowhere in Scotland or in Britain that does better, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw that comment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. and learned Gentleman that I was not casting aspersions on Perth and Kinross district council. I simply could not help noticing that he found what I was saying amusing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it would assist my hon. Friend if I drew his attention to the fact that one of the reasons why Perth is doing so well these days is that the district council is no longer under Conservative control. It is under the control of a coalition of Labour, the SNP and the alliance parties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect to my hon. Friend and to the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross, this is a subject that should not be a matter of political debate. Any responsible representative of people in Scotland wants to provide adequate housing for all of them, and in particular for the most severely disadvantaged people.<br><br>
In that category, I refer not only to elderly people, the mentally ill and so on, but also to young people leaving the care of local authorities and ex-offenders, and no doubt there are other groups that we should consider. Such groups tend to be the most complicated people for whom to find suitable housing, and they could be at risk of neglect and difficulties arising from that neglect. There is a case for writing a provision on to the face of the Bill, and I shall be grateful for the Minister's reply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I pay tribute to the Scottish Council for the Single Homeless and Mr. Laurie Naumann, who has been extremely active on its behalf. My Department will be having discussions with the council later this week.<br><br>
We have now heard exactly what the hon. Gentleman means by the phrase "disadvantaged groups", and he mentioned mentally ill and elderly persons. I am happy to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0134">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 99</span>
confirm that the substantial programme of work currently undertaken by the SSHA and the housing association movement will be a large part of the work of Scottish Homes. The new body will play a full role in the provision of housing for special needs, in which many housing associations specialise, but it would be wrong to put such a vague concept into the Bill. It is vague because it is difficult to know what other groups might be categorised as disadvantaged. Do we include travelling people and ethnic minorities?<br><br>
Scottish Homes, as we discussed during our earlier debate on homelessness, will look to identify, in cooperation with local authorities and others, those areas of housing provision, management and tenure in which it can make the most useful contribution. I am sure that its efforts will benefit those with special needs—the elderly, the disabled and the mentally ill—together with those currently catered for in amenity housing. Our pursuit of choice and diversity can lead only to a wider variety of housing to the benefit of the disadvantaged, to use the hon. Member's term.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will see that his amendment is unnecessary and will withdraw it. Failing that, I shall have to ask the Committee to reject it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Galloway <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Hillhead)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned the homeless and travelling people. I hope that that will allow me to say a few words, without straying from the subject, about the extraordinary remarks made earlier in the debate by the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker). I have been brooding on them since he made them, as I found them deeply offensive. I am referring to his remarks about the homeless, particularly associated with the seasonal fruit-pickings in Blairgowrie.<br><br>
One reason why I feel so strongly about it is that I was once that soldier. I in my summer holidays and my family in theirs used to make the trek to Blairgowrie to pick fruit, not because we liked the stain of the berry juice on our hands but because of economic necessity. As those who visit Blairgowrie in the summer were described earlier as a sort of infestation, I became more and more offended. That was why I rose angrily to my feet at that time.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Tayside, North said that the travelling people and those who go to Blairgowrie in the summer swamped the town. Those were the words that he used, as <i>Hansard</i> will show.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not talk about "travelling people".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galloway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that the people who come to the fruit-picking "swamp" the town. He used the word "swamp", which is a very evocative word, redolent of many things and for many of us redolent of the Prime Minister's remarks in another context, which were equally offensive to many people.<br><br>
I am extremely serious about this. The travelling people and others who go to Blairgowrie every summer to pick the fruit are doing a decent and honest day's work; they are decent and honest people. Many of them are the repositories of some of the finest Scottish folk traditions—people like Belle and Alec Stewart, great holders of Scottish cultural tradition. To hear them described, as they were earlier today, as being self-inflicted homeless people who swamp Blairgowrie annually, when in fact its economy booms during that summer period as in no other
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 100</span>
period these days, was deeply offensive to me. I want to use the opportunity to speak afforded by the Minister's remarks and I hope that I have not diverted the Committee from its business.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot let those offensive remarks go unanswered. It is offensive, coming from the source that it does, that the hon. Gentleman should suggest that, first, I do not understand what is happening in the town where I live and, secondly, that at any point I blamed it on the travelling people. I never once used the term "travelling people". If the hon. Gentleman was aware of the true position, he would know that the travelling fraternity, whom I know very well, is a tiny portion of the numbers that come into the Blairgowrie area. The people come in from all over, largely from Dundee and the west of Scotland. Many of them come to pick berries, and they are welcome to do so. Many of them come and are law-abiding: they are welcome. Sadly, others come who are not welcome: they are not law-abiding and they are no credit to themselves or to society.<br><br>
Such people arrive there knowing that the work is temporary. That small community, which lost more than 500 jobs in 1978, cannot possibly absorb those numbers and provide regular work for them. They arrive knowing that the work is temporary and then they attempt to stay there. That is the problem. If the hon. Gentleman consults Belle Stewart, who knows the position as well as I do, she will confirm what I am saying. This situation affects the travelling people, who often have genuine problems and must be treated differently, because they are different.<br><br>
I never once used the term "travelling people" and I find it offensive that the hon. Gentleman should try to misconstrue the facts. In his situation, he should know how important it is to have the facts accurately recorded. I shall ensure that his message this afternoon and what I said this morning and this afternoon are properly and fully aired in Blairgowrie.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to stray into the crossfire about berry-picking and travelling people, but I want, perhaps slighty more appositely—although I make no complaint about the important problem of travelling people and those who pick berries in seasonal employment—to ask the Minister to reconsider the amendment which has my name attached to it as well as the names of other hon. Members. All that the amendment says is that due regard should be paid to disadvantaged groups. It is the last redoubt of all Ministers in trouble clutching for definitional protection to say, "This is all very well. We are in favour of it, but we cannot define it. Therefore, we cannot have it."<br><br>
In the provision of housing management schemes, tenancy arrangements and the rest of it, some regard must be taken of disadvantaged groups. The Minister and I know that local authorities already do that. I think that I heard him say this morning that we do not want to treat some of those disadvantaged groups in any way differently. I understand what he means by that: we do not want to make two classes of tenants. But to ensure that there are not two classes of tenants, we must recognise that there is a category of person who needs not simply financial or social but sometimes physical and other support even to get to the starting line of being anything like equal to the ordinary tenant with a family who is trying to make sensible provision for his housing need.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0135">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 101</span>
Authorities will certainly have additional and different management requirements if they ar dealing with single-parent families, early leavers from home in distressed circumstances, battered wives or young mothers with children who may need creche facilities. All those people need special consideration, and there is no easy way of dealing them in the totality.<br><br>
That is where the Minister's definitional point comes in. To that extent, I agree with him: we cannot simply lump all these people together and say that they are disadvantaged groups. But I can see disadvantaged groups as soon as they come across my surgery doorstep, because they are invariably in some distress and need urgent and sometimes specialist help and assistance. It is no use if we do not recognise that, and the Bill does not recognise that.<br><br>
The amendment at least attempts to resolve the problem. The clause may be the wrong place; there may be other ways of doing it. If there were no way, I should be very nervous that those needs might not properly be met. If the Secretary of State will be so good at issuing codes of practice and guidance to make Scottish Homes shape up to his wishes, this is certainly an area where, if he cannot put it on the face of the primary legislation, he should make sure that it has due regard to the needs of those disadvantaged groups.</span></p>
<p>5.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Adam Ingram <span class='memberconstituency'>(East Kilbride)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I noted the Minister's claim that he was sumpathetic to the appeal from my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) with regard to disadvantaged groups. We welcome his assurance that discussions will take place with the Scottish Council for the Single Homeless, but I fear that what we shall get today will be no more than sympathetic noises. I remind the Minister—and it is unfortunate that the Minister of State responsible for new towns has just left the Room—that those sympathetic noises were not made in relation to the new towns. There was a moratorium on house building in the new towns until very recently. It took a large and vociferous campaign on behalf of the district councils and other organisations to overcome that moratorium. During the moratorium there was a build-up of problems across the community, which seriously affected the disadvantaged groups as much as it affected other people trying to get houses within the new towns. That is what concerns me.<br><br>
I take the point that the Minister is prepared to be sumpathetic, but we need more flesh on the bones than just sympathetic noises. It would be useful if the Committee could be advised of the nature of the discussions that he will have with the Scottish Council for the Single Homeless. Is it at his initiative or is it because that organisation is saying, rightly, that there is a need for urgent discussions because of the Bill and because of the council's experience generally on the Scottish housing scene?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the fact the Under-Secretary of State has paid tribute to the work of the Scottish Council for the Single Homeless in general, and Laurie Naumann in particular. I was speaking to Mr. Naumann on the telephone this afternoon, and the fear that he expressed about the possibility that Scottish Homes might not attach the importance and weight that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 102</span>
might be required to the provision of specialist housing for disadvantaged groups of people is very genuine. How often have we heard Ministers saying that there is something wrong with the drafting of an amendment, and asking what the term "disadvantaged" means. I accept that. Nevertheless, Mr. Naumann has put forward the amendment as a suggestion and we have tabled it for the consideration of the Committee so that we can debate the principle. There must be genuine concern that a new body such as Scottish Homes will devote the bulk of its budget to promoting mainstream housing; that providing housing for ex-offenders, the mentally ill or elderly people is complicated and if it does not have a specific duty to put at least part of its energy into that, it might be neglected.<br><br>
It is precisely because I put a high value on the work done by housing associations in providing for special needs in my constituency that I am anxious that such development work should continue. I am talking about providing sheltered housing for elderly people, for the mentally ill and similar developments provided by housing associations in my constituency. It is a valuable development towards which the housing association movement has contributed greatly. That will continue, provided that the framework of legislation is right and the framework of finance is right.<br><br>
We require more than lip service about this being a good thing. It would be useful if there was a specific reference on the face of the Bill which ensured that Scottish Homes and, through Scottish Homes, the housing associations, co-operatives, local authorities and everyone else involved in the provision of housing in Scotland, made proper provision and paid due attention to the urgent needs of specifically disadvantaged groups of people. That may not be the proper way to describe those groups for the purposes of the statute, but the Minister can help us here. If he will give us an assurance, I think that we can make progress.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In answer to the hon. Member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram), I should say that the meeting with the Scottish Council for the Single Homeless was agreed in principle some time ago, although arrangements for it have been made relatively recently. The Scottish Development Department meets a wide variety of bodies, such as Shelter and the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, as a matter of good practice. The Scottish Council for the Single Homeless gets funding from the Scottish Development Department and the social work services group, and I pay tribute to the work of the Scottish Council for the Single Homeless.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire asked if our approach would be different. The main difference in appraoch is that we want action in urban renewal and the approach to those problems to take place more rapidly than it has in the past. It is undesirable to complicate the functions of Scottish Homes with specific references to different categories of persons or type of provision, however well-meaning, because Scottish Homes' powers are adequate for this and other purposes. I make it clear that Scottish Homes will have due regard to those with the most pressing housing needs.<br><br>
If one were to write into the Bill many different categories which must be specifically helped, it might have the effect of ensuring that other well-deserving people would receive less priority. Priorities might shift in two or three years' time, thus requiring further legislation. If the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0136">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 103</span>
legislation is drafted as at present it will enable Scottish Homes to respond with sufficient flexibility to meet the points made by the hon. Member for East Lothian, but not so as to exclude other groups later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not like getting into confrontation with the Government or anyone else on such point of principle, but the Minister's latter remarks gave us no cause to be reassured. He said that the Government were anxious to make more rapid progress in area renewal and in peripheral estates. So do we all. But there must be a danger when setting up such a new body, which will have much pressure put upon it by Ministers to be seen to be achieving things and making dramatic progress in specific areas so that there can be good press releases and we can have pictures of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West opening housing schemes and all the rest of it—[HON. MEMBERS: "With an elephant!"] I was not going to mention the elephant. I see that the hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale has returned—whether on his elephant or something else we do not know.<br><br>
There must be genuine anxiety that while media prestige schemes are being shoved through to glorify Ministers or anyone else, small groups of people who have urgent and special needs may be neglected. It is precisely because I am anxious to see housing associations such as the Ark housing association, which is doing valuable work with two small projects in my constituency, one at East Linton and one at Musselburgh, providing housing for mentally ill people, that I want such small projects to go ahead.<br><br>
Other housing associations—the Beild is the one with which I am most familiar—provide sheltered housing schemes for elderly people in small communities. We want to see that kind of thing going ahead. There must be a genuine anxiety with the massive new housing quango envisaged by the Government, which will have the job of redeveloping Easterhouse, Castlemilk and the larger estates in the bigger cities. What hope is there that a reasonable share of the funds will go into small projects in small neighbourhoods, providing for small groups of people who perhaps have not been heard of by the politicians, the general public or the media? There is a case for inserting in the Bill a specific undertaking that such groups of people will be considered, and that a specific statutory duty will be laid on Scottish Homes to devote at least part of its budget to those objectives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is astonishing to hear a Socialist complaining about huge quangos. My understanding of the debate is that the hon. Gentleman wants the quango enlarged by training units, to tell people simple things that ordinary people can discover for themselves. Is it the hon. Gentleman's idea that this quango, of which he complains in derogatory terms, should be enlarged?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman may not be aware that we have moved on from training to provision for disadvantaged people. It should have been clear, from what Opposition Members said on Second Reading, and from our debates in Committee, that we are extremely disturbed by the quango being discussed here, the principle of centralisation, more central control, and more patronage from the Secretary of State, and that we should prefer such things to be co-ordinated by directly elected local authorities. That is what we are arguing for, rather than a central nationally nominated quango.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 104</span>
I had hoped when I rose to speak to the amendment that the Minister would give us an assurance that a specific duty would be laid on Scottish Homes to make provision for those people, and that a form of words might be found, either in this or another part of the Bill. If the Minister can give us an assurance that he is prepared to do that, we shall be willing to accept such an undertaking. In the absence of any assurance, we have no choice but to press the amendment to a Division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Housing associations are already confined in many cases to providing housing for those in necessitous circumstances. That is in their articles of association. Scottish Homes will finance such bodies. This deals in a more practical way with disadvantaged groups—the expression used by the hon. Member for East Lothian, although no clear definition has been given as to what groups would be covered by that general description. I notice that neither the hon. Gentleman nor his colleagues were prepared to say whether ethnic minorities came under that description.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Tories?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does not say which categories come into that group, which causes a problem with definition. I can give an undertaking to the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire that provision for special needs will be built into the formal arrangements with Scottish Homes, comparable with the approved development programme for the Housing Corporation. That is perhaps the commitment that he wanted. It may not be in the Bill, but I am happy to give that undertaking on those arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that was almost an assurance. Given that it was meant to be an assurance, we must use it carefully, and protect our right to return to it on Report if necessary. Since we have had the nearest thing yet to a concession from the Minister, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The main purpose of the amendment is to give the new agency the duty to maintain a register of
<br><blockquote><p>"all persons and bodies to whom it provides financial assistance",</p></blockquote>
and to exercise a supervisory role and control over those bodies. In effect, we propose a regulatory function for the new authority. We must consider several factors here. One is the substantial amounts of public money involved, to be distributed through the medium of Scottish Homes, in part for its own functions, but also to the private sector. I have already, in moving an earlier amendment, voiced
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0137">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 105</span>
considerable fears about the effect which the existence of Scottish Homes and its disbursement of funds to the private sector will have on, aand the possible distortion of, the housing market in Scotland.<br><br>
Let us look at the history of the Housing Corporation, which was introduced in 1974 to control the abuses which then existed among housing associations in the United Kingdom. Since then it has taken a grip of the problems in that end of the market.<br><br>
5.45 pm<br><br>
I was not practising as a solicitor at that time, but I have some experience of those abuses. Effectively, any group of lawyers, architects and builders could get together and make themselves eligible for all sorts of financial benefits simply by calling themselves a housing association, and using the existing law, which had provided little in the way of regulation, and little control of the public money which became available to those housing associations. Since the Housing Corporation was formed and started to perform its regulatory role, by registering housing associations and closely monitoring their activities, there has been a considerable improvement in the quality of housing associations in Scotland and in the quality and range of housing which the associations have provided. There have been developments in areas which, in the 1970s, we might not even have considered, including a huge increase in provision by housing associations, for example, of sheltered housing, specialised housing for disabilities and special needs, such as housing for youngsters, because the under-25 market is difficult for local authorities to meet. The housing associations have gone into and developed that area.<br><br>
With the regulation has come responsibility and expansion in the provision and range of housing, to the benefit of the general housing market. The housing associations have gone into areas where local authorities could not afford to go, and they should be applauded for that. The Housing Corporation, too, must be applauded for the job that it has done in encouraging that development and encouraging the housing associations to go into those areas. I must not forget the contribution made by the Scottish Development Department.<br><br>
As we have heard throughout the debates on the Bill, there are serious housing problems in Scotland. The Opposition believe that those problems should be adequately tackled, which they will not be without proper supervision and regulation of all the bodies, organisations and individuals receiving funds from the new Scottish Homes authority.<br><br>
We have spoken of the difficulties of homelessness, and the huge increase in homelessness during the past four years. We have also spoken of the length of waiting lists. This morning, I said that 5,115 families in Aberdeen are on the housing waiting list. That is a 62 per cent. increase since 1981.<br><br>
If the Opposition had a philosophy on housing, and the problems of the housing market, it would be that we must recognise that good quality housing is just as important and necessary as our education or Health Service. The policy for which I would aim is one of flexibility, providing low-cost housing accessible to all sections of the population, not just to those who can afford to pay. That is the philosophy that I would seek to bring to the Bill, one
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 106</span>
which I am concerned that the Government do not bring. The Bill opens a whole new can of worms in the housing market, with the distortions of which I have spoken, especially with its concentration on the private sector.<br><br>
If we consider where the Bill is leading us—I shall restrict myself to the amendment and repeat that large sums of money will be made available to the private sector—it is wrong to assume that the private sector will solve the housing problems. I have considerable, unhappy, experience of the private sector. The Government's approach is rigid and dogmatic, and ignores experience in the private market. I shall use some examples to illustrate that.<br><br>
Governments of all parties have taken it upon themselves to interfere in housing. Governments have interfered in every aspect of housing. There is Government intervention in owner-occupation, with huge subsidies going to owner-occupiers through mortgage tax relief. Throughout this century Governments of both major parties have put increasing controls on the private rented market; and in the public sector there has been a huge injection of funds, and various controls and encouragements have been given to local authorities. Considering what has happened to the private rented market and the reasons why Governments have sought to control it, we understand why some regulation is necessary.<br><br>
I can talk about the experience of tenants who have lived in accommodation with totally inadequate amenities. In the area where I worked as a solicitor, there are still many tenements where whole families do not even have the dignity of an internal toilet. I have seen landlords harass tenants. I have had to deal with the problem of landlords seeking to evade their responsibility under the Rent Acts by all sorts of legal fictions and devices—the creation of the licence, the early-morning delivery of rolls and milk, so that services are provided, the fictional creation of a live-in relative of the landlord just to get round the Rent Acts. Those are the sorts of problem we are concerned with. I have had tenants who have been harassed by landlords. I once had to deal with a landlord who went to the lengths of removing the roof of a tenement to get rid of his tenants, so that he did not have to go through the court process. The tenants had no option. Just before I was elected to this place I had to deal with the case of a landlord who managed to break into a tenant's property and take the toilet and the bath away.<br><br>
Those are the problems that exist today in the private rented sector. The problems are at the lower end of the market, where most effort is made to get round the regulations. If we create this new body, Scottish Homes, all the public money coming into the public sector will be far too big an attraction for those landlords and fairly unscrupulous people to pass up.<br><br>
The amendment has been introduced for that reason. It would have the same effect as the regulations which apply at present to the registration of housing associations. If a housing association wants to make Housing Corporation money available to it, it must register with the Housing Corporation and satisfy the statutory and other tests that it applies before the money becomes available. We want the same provision to apply to anyone who applies to Scottish Homes for funds for any development project. The duty would be placed on the new body to register that individual or organisation, whether it is a company or a charity and monitor its performance. In that way we could provide one benefit to housing in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0138">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 107</span>
Scotland: we could work towards improving the quality and quantity of housing, instead of creating a mish-mash in which this new body disburses money in the same way as a bank or a building society.<br><br>
The use of public money should be properly regulated, especially in housing, which is so fundamental and important. The expenditure and subsequent performance of that individual or organisation should be regulated, and the best body to do that is the new Scottish Homes, because it will be in the best position to keep tabs on what happens to that money and how that landlord carries out his functions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 72 stands in my name and the names of other hon. Members. I entirely support my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) who spoke to amendments Nos. 46 and 47. The Committee is indebted to the recent work done on its behalf by Shelter and the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, which are right to draw our attention to this important matter.<br><br>
Amendment No. 72 adverts to the fact that the Bill sets up a separate system for approving, monitoring and registering persons or bodies and receiving finance under subsection (3), depending on the sorts of body they are and the functions they fulfil. The basic objective of the amendments is to ensure that a consistent approach is adopted towards all organisations that receive financial assistance from Scottish Homes and, no less important, to satisfy ourselves as Members of the House that public money is being spent properly and is being monitored and accounted for.<br><br>
Will the Minister, first, give us an idea of the sums of money that can be disbursed by Scottish Homes under the various headings? It would be valuable to know the amounts that might be expended in different directions.<br><br>
Secondly, as the Committee will know, the new agency is to provide grants and loans
<br><blockquote><p>"to persons or bodies intending to provide, improve, repair, maintain or manage housing".</p></blockquote>
What tests do the Government expect Scottish Homes to apply? Will they involve financial scrutiny or looking at the constitution of the membership of limited companies? In the case of partnerships, will previous year's accounts be considered? What machinery will be used to allow Scottish Homes to give the seal of approval to the various providers of these services?<br><br>
As we know, only housing associations will have to register with Scottish Homes, and they are to be supervised and controlled by the new agency. But what about the other persons or bodies receiving financial assistance from Scottish Homes? What guarantees will the Government give about those who provide those services? Suppose Scottish Homes provides public funds to help people set up projects and the projects go wrong? Could tenants who suffer prejudice go to the Government and say, "Wait a minute. You said that these people were worthy of support from public funds. I have suffered prejudice at their hands?" Does that give the Government a legal liability under any circumstances? Do tenants have any redress, even at arm's length, from the Government where they have laid hands on an organisation, a person or a body which is providing services under the terms of the clause?<br><br>
At least prima facie it seems inappropriate that public funds should be made available to organisations that are making profits. Some will clearly set out to make profits.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 108</span>
There is perhaps nothing wrong with that, but we should look closely at the interface between organisations whose sole concern is generating profit for their own good and those who set out to provide the range of services and housing arrangements under Scottish Homes.<br><br>
6 pm<br><br>
It is right that we should look carefully at that and ask for specific safeguards on how the moneys will be spent. The other side of the argument is that if the Government set their face against moving in that direction, they are forgoing an opportunity to maintain the highest standards possible, and it is in everyone's interests to maintain such high standards. The Government have it in their gift, if they take proper control, supervision and monitoring powers under the clause, to insist that that is the case. They can say that if those high standards are not met, the money will not flow, and that is a powerful position to be in. But the Government are not taking the powers that we are suggesting. If they did, they would be in a stronger position.<br><br>
In terms of increasing and improving housing standards, the amendments are commendable in themselves, never mind the important aspect of the control of public expenditure and the fact that the Government seem to apply different standards to different people, applying standards to the housing associations but not to the other bodies. That does not make sense and the amendments are a constructive attempt to put that right. They give the Government the power and authority to improve housing standards in a way that is wholly appropriate, and I hope that the Government will seriously consider them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that we all subscribe to many of the intentions behind the amendments. It is right that Scottish Homes should promote a wide variety of providers of housing and that it should be concerned with the performance of those to which it provides financial assistance. Once again, these are not basic policy issues but are about the best way in which to give effect to objectives that are widely shared in the Committee.<br><br>
Amendment No. 46 seeks to require Scottish Homes to take the same promotional and development role with those whom it assists financially as it will with housing associations. The promotion function of Scottish Homes in relation to housing associations arises from the equivalent function of the Housing Corporation. There is no doubt that this function needs to be continued in that context, given that housing associations still provide only about 2 per cent. of Scotland's housing stock, despite the huge increase in funding that we have provided since 1979.<br><br>
However, there is no obvious advantage in applying to other housing providers the structure developed for the original conception of housing associations in the 1960s and 1970s. Not all new providers of housing will require the support—in the non-financial sense—that has been appropriate to the fledgling housing association movement.<br><br>
To the extent that Scottish Homes needs to provide promotional and development support for new providers, such as housing co-operatives, the powers in subsection (3)(c), which we have already considered, are fully adequate.<br><br>
Registration and supervision, with which amendments No. 47 and 42 deal, are also functions that Scottish Homes will inherit from the Housing Corporation. They are right
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0139">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 109</span>
for organisations that are to be funded by the public purse to the high level that many housing associations will receive. That is the point that the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire made when he asked about the expected funding. Scottish Homes' financial assistance to other landlords or developers is likely to be much lower than that given to housing associations. We see no case for a registration system, since they will have no automatic right to funding, such as housing associations enjoy, nor will there be the same general presumption that all of their activities will require funding.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) asked about standards. Ensuring that standards are met is a different matter. It is important that this should apply to all recipients of public funds and that there should be proper, decent and appropriate standards.<br><br>
However, supervision arrangements that apply to the housing associations are by no means the only means of achieving this. For other housing providers, standards should be controlled through contractual conditions accompanying the financial assistance, as are often imposed by the Scottish Development Agency or the Highlands and Islands Development Board when providing assistance. Such an approach allows conditions to be closely tailored to the circumstances of individual projects and is, in general, more appropriate to the world in which such landlords and developers are accustomed to operate. It is not necessary for Scottish Homes to be given specific functions and duties in respect of that method of proceeding. The powers proposed in the Bill will be adequate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the Minister's last point about standards, I understand him to be saying that there will be contractual relationship between the new authority and any individual or organisation that receives money. Does the Minister foresee that those contractual arrangements will extend, for example, to the conditions of any tenancy and that the arrangements for the let will be controlled with minimum standards laid down as to the functions of the landlord and the way in which the tenant will be treated, or will they simply relate to the expenditure of money? That is important. It is not just that we can use the analogy with the SDA and the HIDB about the proper provision of a factory. I do not want it to stop at the stage where the house is provided; I want the future letting of that house to be controlled and the activities of the individual or organisation that receives public funds to operate in a public-spirited way, exactly as local authorities and Government Departments insist on contract compliance in certain circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I reply to the hon. Gentleman, may I return to an earlier point made by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, who asked what would happen if matters went wrong. Giving financial assistance does not create any legal responsibility on the Government's part, as is clearly established in relation to its assistance for industry. But Scottish Homes in general would seek to help tenants adversely affected by a landlord's failure to find a new landlord, and I see Scottish Homes as playing a key role in that connection.<br><br>
My answer to the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South is perhaps not so emphatic as he would wish. The hon. Gentleman wants to know whether contractual conditions
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 110</span>
included would relate to the terms of the tenancy. The answer is possibly. They will certainly not be concerned only with the spending of money; they will relate to the service provided. I suspect that it would depend to some extent on the nature of the developer or building society, or whoever it may be, who approached Scottish Homes as to exactly what was proposed. Scottish Homes would certainly have the powers to put into a contract all the necessary conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are widespread fears among my constituents in Morningside, Marchmont and Newington about the possibility of funding regulated developments—<i>[Interruption.]</i> I speak of Labour's heartland. There is genuine concern that under Scottish Homes the door will be open to further undesirable landlordism in those areas. There are many complaints, which I have passed on to the Minister. It is common in many cities and large towns for people to buy flats with substantial mortgages and then, because of the Government's housing benefit regulations, crowd people into them and get back moneys from a large number of people. The quality of life in the stair, close or street can degenerate markedly. One of the aims of the amendment is to bring in greater regulation under Scottish Homes. I welcome any moves to extend the control of landlords, not only those who have two or three properties but even those who have only one.<br><br>
Edinburgh district council has used the law to its fullest extent to try to control and regulate landlords who take an irresponsible attitude and do not care how unruly their tenants are. Sadly, it has not managed to prosecute on many occasions. We welcome any strengthening of the law to control undesirable activities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I hear my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) describing parts of his constituency, I realise the extent of the Conservative rout in Scotland by our victory in the last election.<br><br>
All Opposition Members of the Committee share the anxiety expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran). Not only will members of the Committee examine the terms of the Bill, but other people in Scotland and elsewhere will size up the commercial opportunities which may come their way as a consequence of this legislation.<br><br>
If the Government are telegraphing to such people, "Don't worry, lads. We'll give you the incentives and provide the funds. All we want you to do is to provide the houses, and we'll turn a blind eye to anything you get up to in your relationships with your tenants and the standards of housing you provide," I fear that they may attract the shark-like operators whom we do not want to be involved in letting housing in Scotland.<br><br>
We shall have plenty of opportunities when we debate part II of the Bill to discuss the threat of a return of Rachmanism to Scotland. The Minister could, however, avail himself of the opportunity here and now to put down a marker and make it clear to any private, corporate or other landlord who may enter this scheme that, although we all welcome the provision of additional rented housing in Scotland, we are not prepared to sacrifice all standards. We are not prepared to turn a blind eye to bad practices by landlords in terms of excessive rents, bad housing conditions or harassment.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0140">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 111</span>
We shall discuss these matters later. There is a need for a safeguard. Just as there is provision in the Bill to require Scottish Homes, as the successor body to the Housing Corporation in Scotland, to exercise control over registered housing associations, there is a need for someone to exercise control over registered housing associations, there is a need for someone to exercise direct control over other landlords who may get financial benefit from Scottish Homes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the registration and supervision powers which the new agency will inherit from the housing corporation in Scotland were inappropriate to private sector developers and landlords. Instead, he will seek to control the use of public money by these people through contractual conditions. He has to make a stronger case and explain exactly how, through a contract intervention between Scottish Homes and the private sector landlords and property developers, the Government will monitor and supervise the use of public money for private sector housing projects.<br><br>
How will Scottish Homes know who are genuine private sector landlords trying to promote housing projects in a given area and who are the bad shark-like private sector landlords and property developers who are only interested in ripping off the public sector? What type of body will Scottish Homes be? Will it be based only in Edinburgh and Glasgow, or will there be local offices in every area to monitor the contracts entered into locally with private developers?<br><br>
Even if the Government set up a network of local offices, how will the new people appointed to them get to grips with the housing situation unless they rely heavily on the expertise of local district councils that have been dealing with the private sector for many years?<br><br>
The Minister must assure us that it will not be possible for the sharks, who are only interested in ripping off the public purse, to exploit the contractual condition attached to the distribution of public money to them.<br><br>
6.15 pm<br><br>
If the Minister conceded that it would be proper not only to register housing associations but also all the private sector bodies that apply for public sector help through Scottish Homes, he would be able to try to wipe out an abuse that has the potential to increase. I refer to the confusion that has been deliberately sown by a number of private sector developers who call themselves housing associations. They do not register as housing associations and do not qualify for any of the benefits that registered housing associations receive, but they still call themselves housing associations.<br><br>
In Dundee, there is a registered body called the Hillcrest housing association. It is an above board, bone fide housing association. But there is also a private sector developer called Hallcrest housing association that is not registered, and that seeks to sow confusion so that people mistake the private sector developer as being a housing association. A new body is rumoured to be about to set up as the Discovery housing association. It will not be a housing association but a private sector property developer and landlord.<br><br>
The Minister must address his mind to that problem. How will he reserve "housing association" for registered housing associations only in order to eliminate confusion among people who cannot tell the difference between one and the other?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 112</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I understood the Minister's initial answer on this group of amendments, he thought that it was inappropriate that the registration procedures currently apply to housing associations should apply to all and sundry. I am prepared to listen to that argument more carefully. But the Minister must recognise that, although there might be quite onerous registration requirements for housing associations, there should be a measure, record or list of people who are receiving public support. I shall state one reason why that should be so.<br><br>
If many people are intent on supplying either landlord or house building provisions, I am keen that as much of that work as possible, consistent with the normal rules of the tendering process, should be kept within the local area.<br><br>
I do not know about other hon. Members, but there is a fear in south-east Scotland that some of the bigger developers and landlord groups will move in from the central industrial belt to the rural and landlord areas of Scotland and start purveying their services or building facilities in competition with and in preference to local firms, agencies or local landlords. If, for no other reason, there are cogent reasons for keeping a list so that people can pay their 25p or whatever it is to see what is in the register of habitable property, there should be a provision to enable people to see whom Scottish Homes are supporting, at whatever level and to whatever extent. That is important.<br><br>
I return to the question, to which I do not think that the Minister addressed his reply to any extent, of the tests that will be applied for approval. I understand that the Government have said that they will take steps to approve. I ask again what are the tests? What questions will be asked? What sort of information will be sought? How much investigation, if any, will there be of the character of individuals who propose to provide some of those facilities and services or to run other organisations? What will be done physically by Scottish Homes to ensure that it can give its seal of approval to people who will operate in their own ways with the support of Scottish Homes, if the Bill is made law?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There has been quite a gap since the Minister responded to my points, but I should like to return to them and press him a wee bit more.<br><br>
There are good and bad landlords. It is unfortunate that in a debate such as this we tend to concentrate on those who cause the problems—the bad landlords—and the good landlords obviously suffer.<br><br>
I am prepared to be generous to Scottish Homes and accept that normally, when an application is made to it for funding, it will carry out a fairly vigorous check—at least I hope so—on the standing and background of the individual or organisation applying and also on the viability of the proposals. Presumably the acceptance or otherwise of a proposal will have to fit into the scheme of things. I will pay credit in anticipation that that is the way that Scottish Homes will operate.<br><br>
I am concerned about what the Minister has said about, for example, contractual obligations. I can envisage a situation where a loan is made with a standard security which has a fixed term, with repayments. In such a case, it would be possible to tie into that security or contract, at least for the length of it, the sort of conditions that I asked for, particularly the conditions of tenancy and the obligations that I hope Scottish Homes will place on a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0141">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 113</span>
landlord in such a position to operate as a good landlord in terms of the law and to provide a service that we all want to provide, which is good quality housing.<br><br>
But there are other areas that I am concerned about. Under clause 2(2)<i>(a),</i> the authority has power to make grants. I assume that in practice the grants would be made in the least profitable areas of housing.<br><br>
If we consider specialised needs, I have some experience of housing for the mentally ill and the mentally handicapped. When a grant is made for a project and a landlord, a builder or anyone else is tied to it what will be the length of that contract? What responsibility will Scottish Homes take for the proper provision for the tenants, who are a vulnerable group in such a situation?<br><br>
I bear in mind the considerable amount of public money that goes into landlords' pockets. The current Government philosophy and professional thinking are in favour of community care for the mentally handicapped and mentally ill. Many people over the past 10 years have left hospitals and have gone into a number of environments. Some have been fortunate enough to go into local authority sheltered accommodation or day-care facilities. Some have gone into housing association hostels and accommodation specifically provided for them. But there is a large floating population, which is now being considerably exploited. It includes people who are a lot worse off than when they were in hospital because they have gone into the private sector.<br><br>
I know one property in Dundee that used to be a children's home. It now provides accommodation for a host of "problem tenants" such as former drug addicts, current drug addicts, children who have left care, the mentally ill and the mentally handicapped. They are charged extortionate rents. Minimum facilities are provided. Basically, it is a roof over their heads. There is no control or supervision by the DHSS, which provides the funding, or the local authority, because it is outwith the local authority's social work powers. There is real exploitation subsidised by the public purse through the housing benefit scheme and payments from the DHSS.<br><br>
I am concerned about the possibility of Scottish Homes funding such landlords. The assurances given to us by the Minister are not sufficient.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the most important questions that have been put to me concerns the tests for landlords. Scottish Homes will inherit the experience of the Housing Corporation in assessing the performance of housing associations. Already the Housing Corporation has built up a considerable body of expertise. The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) called for a vigorous check. I believe that Scottish Homes will look at the financial competence and evidence that landlords are capable of providing a good service, and that the expertise of those who manage housing associations will be invaluable in that connection.<br><br>
I was asked whether safeguards were written into the contract. The answer simply is yes. The safeguards will be written into the contract so that they can be legally enforced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At whose instance? If the contract is between Scottish Homes and the landlord, what right does
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 114</span>
the tenant have to activate an action enforcing the conditions of that contract to which he is not directly a party?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, no one will become a tenant unless he or she wishes to do so under the terms of whatever contract is agreed. If a contract is breached, there is a right for anyone who has a title—who has a direct interest in the matter—to sue and to raise the matter in court.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are two separate contracts. There is the contract between Scottish Homes and the landlord, and there is the contract between the tenant and the landlord. If the landlord is in breach of his contract with Scottish Homes, Scottish Homes may not be aware of the circumstancess and it may be the tenant who is suffering from that breach of contract. What can the tenant do about it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Tenants will have every right to go to Scottish Homes to make a complaint if there is any question of the contract not being properly enforced. The hon. Gentleman may have in mind, say, a building society that does up a whole block of flats. The tenants will know the conditions of the contracts for all the tenants in the block. If there is a breach of the contract and, say, the building is not kept wind and water tight, they immediately have legal rights that can be taken up in the courts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are moving into interesting territory. Will tenants in such circumstances have a right to see the detailed terms of the contract between their landlord and Scottish Homes? Will that be a public document? Will it be available to tenants?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot guarantee that in all circumstances every contract between Scottish Homes and a private landlord will automatically be made readily available. There might be problems of commercial confidentiality. The tenant would be wise to make certain that he knew exactly the terms of the contract. If there is a breach of a contract, Scottish Homes will have to take the action. But it will have an obvious interest in enforcing the contract which it makes. It will usually be aware of breaches but will act on information from tenants as and when appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely the tenant must have a right to make sure that Scottish Homes enforces the contract in the tenant's interest. I am astonished that the Minister is including commercial confidentiality in a contract that is the subject of substantial amounts of public money. That is ridiculous. He may merely have been covering his flank and using ministerial language, and there may be highly exceptional circumstances, but if he is saying that that is the run-of-the-mill situation, it is totally unacceptable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I am saying that. I am saying that there might be circumstances in which it was not made public, in exactly the way that the hon. Gentleman said. I shall check up on that because I realise that it is material. But if I wished to become a tenant in a block, I should want to be certain that I knew not only what the terms of the tenancy were but whether my rights were enforceable. I should be particularly interested in the kinds of points made by the hon. Gentleman</span></p>

<p>6.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a pedantic, legal point. I have made fairly clear what I am concerned about in general terms, but another point must be made in view of the Minister's answer.<br><br>
A tenant of a local authority at present can take action against that authority if it fails to fulfil any of its statutory functions. In this context, there is no duty on Scottish Homes to do what the Minister has just suggested it will do—enter into contracts to regulate the terms of the tenancy or the operation of the landlord's functions. That removes from the tenant the right to oblige Scottish Homes to enforce the contract, because it is feasible for other larger, commercial reasons to put the individual tenant's rights to one side, because they prejudice these larger, more commercial reasons. Without a specific power which places an obligation on Scottish Homes, the Minister does not satisfy me that the tenant in that position is properly protected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Scottish Homes would have a specific power to act against any landlord who broke the terms of the contract, and any tenant—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If it chose not to, what could the tenant do?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: —and any tenant would have the right to go to Scottish Homes to point out that proper standards were not being maintained. Scottish Homes would have the right to act on informatiom given to it and to see the matter through to a successful conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is not answering the point. If a contractual period has expired or if Scottish Homes refuses for other reasons to protect an individual tenant, what right has the tenant? Unless a provision of the kind proposed in the amendment is incorporated in the Bill, the tenant has no rights.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman envisages a situation in which he thinks that Scottish Homes will not have taken the necessary action. Clearly the tenant has the legal right to take up the matter through the courts, if necessary. He can apply, with legal aid, to lawyers who may help him do that.<br><br>
Either the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) or one of his hon. Friends asked whether Scottish Homes would be decentralised and have local offices. I envisage that to be the case.<br><br>
With regard to safeguards written into the contract, Scottish Homes will seek to deal with landlords which it is convinced are reputable. The contract conditions are likely to seek to prevent any deterioration in the physical standards of the properties concerned.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) asked about the registering of a body which was not a registered housing association. As I understand it, we cannot control the registering of company names, as that is the responsibility of the Registrar of Companies, which may or may not restrict the use of terms such as "housing association". That is therefore more a matter for the registrar than for me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister therefore saying that he is prepared to tolerate private developers calling themselves housing associations deliberately to confuse the general public and saying that that is a matter not for the Government but for somebody else?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 116</span>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If inaccurate information is put out about a body to the effect that it is a registered housing association—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not my point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It depends whether it has been legally accepted by the Registrar of Companies. If it has, it will be hard to say that the body concerned is acting illegally.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister not concede that the Government have certain responsibilities? It may well be legal for the Registrar of Companies to accept the name Hallcrest housing association, but the Government should take steps to make it illegal and to protect the name "housing association" so that it can be applied only to properly registered housing associations and the general public will not be confused in the way that they are now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman can be certain that there will be no possibility of Scottish Homes treating a body of that nature as a registered housing association, because it clearly will not be registered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about the general point?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point that the hon. Gentleman is making about the registering of names is a Department of Trade and Industry matter. The hon. Gentleman must follow it up with the Minister concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On companies and the continuation of safeguards, the Minister said that Scottish Homes would accept a company for funding only if it was convinced that it was reputable. Those were his words. I do not deny that, but companies can be bought and sold. The true owners can hide behind nominations. Will Scottish Homes be able to take a golden share?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If a body which formed a contract with Scottish Homes did not fulfil the terms of that contract, Scottish Homes would have the power to step in, because it would have an obligation to the tenants concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And if the contract had expired?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let us take a hypothetical group of people—a company, a landlord, almost anybody—called the Fly-by-Night Housing Co. Ltd., which acquires some property in one of the four cities in Scotland. It has a good look at the Bill and thinks, "We should be able to touch Scottish Homes for some money and make a quick buck." It goes along to Scottish Homes and says that it intends to provide specialist housing for a certain group of people, perhaps elderly people. It can then touch not only Scottish Homes but also the Department of Health and Social Security or the health board for money to support its activities.<br><br>
The company improves the property or brings it up to some standard, and it leads elderly or disabled people to believe that they will be able to move into these desirable flats with secured tenancies, or whatever they are called in future, at fair rents, and that everything will be all right. People move in and start paying the rents originally agreed. But then they discover that the rents increase, repairs are not carried out and services are not provided in the manner in which they ought to be provided. Perhaps that company has sold the property to someone else, and the trail becomes difficult to follow.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0143">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 117</span>
These circumstances can arise. All sorts of obscure transactions involving rented property are taking place in our cities now. That is bad enough, but it is even worse that substantial quantities of public money will be involved. What redress will those tenants have? Will they be able to go to Scottish Homes and say, "We know that you have been taken for a ride and that you put a great deal of public money into this operation. The place is falling apart, repairs have not been carried out, we cannot afford the rent, and we have been sold a pup"? Who will be responsible? Who will protect people exploited in those circumstances?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is subsidised Rachmanism.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend says, this is one stage worse than straightforward Rachmanism—good, clean, old-fashioned Rachmanism! This would be state-subsidised Rachmanism. Therefore, it is not unreasonable that the Committee should ask the Minister to provide safeguards to control and deal with this practice. At the very least, can he tell us what tenants are supposed to do if they find themselves in such a trap?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, strict conditions to ensure that the proper standards are maintained should be written into the contract between Scottish Homes and the body concerned. Similarly, the tenant will have his own contract with the body concerned, the terms of which should be enforceable.<br><br>
If the tenant has a grievance, he should go to Scottish Homes, which will be able to investigate it, in the same way as a local authority tenant who has a grievance now can go to the hon. Gentleman or come to me, and we shall investigate. Often the grievance may be legitimate, but sometimes it may be less legitimate. It depends on the circumstances. But I have confidence that those involved with registering housing associations and ensuring that proper standards are maintained have developed a considerable amount of expertise over the years and that that pool of expertise will be invaluable in ensuring that contracts are properly enforced. The SSHA has developed a similar expertise in monitoring its housing stock.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's answer is less than satisfactory. He talks about the expertise that has been built up in registering housing associations, but at the same time he tells us that the private sector landlords and property developers will not be registered, so that expertise is not applicable. He seemed to suggest that there was a direct relationship between the contract between Scottish Homes and the body, whatever it happens to be, and the other contract between the private sector landlord and the tenant. If the private sector landlord breaches his agreement with his tenant, the tenant will have a right of appeal to Scottish Homes, because that will be considered to be a breach of the contract between Scottish Homes and the private landlord. Is that what the Minister is saying? He must make it absolutely clear that tenants can appeal to Scottish Homes over the head of the private sector landlord because that private sector landlord is in breach of his contract with them and, therefore, he is also in breach of his contract with Scottish Homes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If proper standards were not being maintained, a tenant would have the right
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 118</span>
to go to Scottish Homes, and Scottish Homes would be empowered to make inquiries and to see that the contract was enforced—if there had been a genuine breach of it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We must have clarification. The Minister has not been very clear. He said that Scottish Homes would apply certain criteria to those private sector landlords to whom it was prepared to give public funding. One of them was that they must be able to show financial competence. Peter Rachman was financially competent. They should be capable of providing a good service. Rachman was capable of providing a good service, but he chose not to. Finally, Scottish Homes would have to be convinced that the private sector landlord was reputable. How is it to know whether the private sector landlord is reputable.<br><br>
Scottish Homes will not be in a position to distinguish between good and bad private sector landlords across the country. In any case, if it enters into a contract with a private sector landlord, will that stipulate that money has been given to the private sector landlord on condition that he lets his property in accordance with certain criteria? That includes rent regime, when repairs will be carried out, who will be owner, that the tenant will be properly notified of owner changes, and so on. Will that be written into the contract between Scottish Homes and the landlord as well as into the contract between the landlord and the tenant?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has asked several questions. We envisage that the contract formed between Scottish Homes and the body concerned will ensure proper standards, and we may have a long debate about what proper standards are.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How will it ensure that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Those who monitor the housing associations at present have a clear idea what proper standards are in the housing association movement, and no one doubts that they have done extremely well and that a body of expertise has been built up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is easier.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman say that that is easier. He may be right. I suggest that that body of expertise will be invaluable in assessing such circumstances and in writing into a contract the necessary stipulations to ensure that proper standards are maintained.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I ask the Minister once again to address his mind to the fact that we who are outside Scottish Homes will not have a clue about those with whom it is dealing. I make no complaint about the way that housing associations have performed and been monitored or controlled.<br><br>
This is an entirely different animal. It is a profit-making animal for a kick-off in terms of the clause, and that is a substantial difference. It brings a new level of worry to us as a Committee, giving public money away through the provisions of the Bill—and for all I know, substantial sums of money. We shall not even be able to see with whom Scottish Homes is dealing. From what the Minister said earlier, there will not even be a register of the people who receive money. I do not even know whether Scottish Homes will produce an annual report to Parliament. I do not know what opportunities there will be for Members of Parliament to take a more strategic view, year on year. At
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0144">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 119</span>
the end of the day, the Public Accounts Committee can wrap itself round Ministers' necks, not the neck of Scottish Homes.<br><br>
6.45 pm<br><br>
So far as I can see, we shall have no real scrutiny ourselves if there is not even a register of names of people organising companies for private profit and providing services under the provisions of the Bill, from which they will derive substantial sums of public money.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 11(6) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of Scottish Homes to make to the Secretary of State, as soon as possible after the end of each financial year, a report dealing with the activities of Scottish Homes during that year."</p></blockquote>
Subsection 7 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of the Secretary of State to lay before each House of Parliament a copy of each report received by him under subsection (6) above."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will that include a record?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course, a record will be kept of all public funds that are used.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will there be a list in those annual reports of authorities, organisations and individuals that are not housing associations but are in receipt of money under the terms of the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has asked me a question that he has already asked, and I have nothing to add to what I have already said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not happy with the answer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that. I shall bear in mind what the hon. Gentleman has said. What I have already said states the position accurately to the best of my ability.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the same theme but a different point, clause 2(3)<i>(a)</i> provides that the powers that Scottish Homes will exercise in relation to subsections (2)<i>(a)</i> to <i>(d)</i> in particular—and those are the paragraphs relating mainly to finance—are subject to the approval of the Secretary of State with the consent of the Treasury. Given the debate that we have had, the Minister must be aware of the considerable concerns of Opposition Members, and I hope that those concerns are wider when we are dealing with public money.<br><br>
How does the Minister see that that approval of the Secretary of State in the context of this debate will be exercised? Will the Secretary of State lay down standards that he expects, in his general approval—which is also mentioned in that paragraph—Scottish Homes to apply when it disburses such money? Will he lay down the conditions that he expects to see applied to contracts between Scottish Homes and individual landlords?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 2(9) states that the Secretary of State has powers to
<br><blockquote><p>"give Scottish Homes directions of a general or specific character".</p></blockquote>
Above it is the statement to the effect that duplication would be grossly inappropriase and should be avoided. For example, there would be no point in both Scottish Homes and a local authority giving funds. But certainly the powers would exist.<br><br>
As for how the powers in clause 2(3)<i>(a)</i> would be used, the approval of the Secretary of State would take the form
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 120</span>
of detailed guidelines, but those are unlikely to seek to usurp the discretion of Scottish Homes to decide the terms of the contracts concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Presumably the Secretary of State, as a public figure with a certain amount of interest in the public weal—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is debatable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I knew somebody would say that. He would presumably have some interest in improving the lot of tenants in Scotland and in the conditions of tenants, for example, the agreements. I can see why the Secretary of State would not want to become involved in detailed contract negotiations, but there must be scope in the powers to which the Minister referred for minimum standards to be set for conditions of tenancy.<br><br>
The area with which we are mainly concerned is the lot of tenants once they move into the private sector. The laying down of minimum standards would surely not prejudice any commercial relationship, for example, with Scottish Homes, and would be appropriate for the Secretary of State to undertake.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I have already answered that point. The Secretary of State will have the ability and capacity to put out detailed guidelines which should deal with that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Just to be clear, there is the second point that these guidelines would cover the terms and conditions of tenancy—at least minimum standards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: General standards are likely to be a matter for discussion between the Scottish Development Department and Scottish Homes, and, if necessary, there can be a direction under clause 4(9), or as I mentioned earlier, it can be done by way of detailed guidelines.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the Minister's answer to the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) about how we are to find out which private sector companies are in receipt of public money from Scottish Homes, he mentioned that Scottish Homes was to make available, at the end of every financial year, a report on its activities to the Secretary of State for Scotland, who was to lay it before Parliament. He did not make it clear whether that report might contain, for example in an appendix, a list of every private sector developer, company or landlord who had received public money from Scottish Homes in the preceding year, and how much public sector money they had received.<br><br>
The Minister also did not make clear whether that report would be circulated more widely than just to Members of Parliament and be sent to all people associated with housing. He should answer these questions. Otherwise what he has suggested is that Scottish Homes should be authorised to spend public money unaccountably and that it would not be possible for Members of Parliament or anyone else to question the types of body receiving public money from a public agency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I note what the hon. Gentleman said, but I cannot add to what I said earlier in the course of the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will there be an appendix?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Apparently not.</span></p>

<p><i>Quesion accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 9, in page 2, line 8, after '(f)', insert, 'assisting local authorities by'.<br><br>
This amendment provides an opportunity to have a big debate on subsection (3)(f), that
<br><blockquote><p>"Scottish Homes shall have the general functions of … (f) undertaking, and assisting the undertaking of, the development, redevelopment and improvement of the physical, social and recreational environment related to housing."</p></blockquote>
It provides scope for extending the principle of area renewal to housing estates, which could be of particular importance in peripheral housing estates; although no doubt it could be equally be brought to bear on a whole range of different communities, rural and urban, in different parts of Scotland. An interesting new principle is being established here, which we would support, but it would be useful to explore it briefly in debate in Committee, in particular to address ourselves to the point made in the amendment ensuing that it was the local authority for the neighbourhood concerned which gave the lead in initiating such comprehensive development of local neighbourhoods.<br><br>
This is a potentially useful measure which could simplify the approach to multiple problems of housing areas in different parts of Scotland. At present, several authorities may be involved or need to become involved in such comprehensive redevelopment of a housing scheme, which might include a regional council, a district council, the Scottish Development Agency, the Scottish Special Housing Association, which is to become Scottish Homes, the Scottish Sports Council, and no doubt others, all of which were involved in funding and initiating activity to provide the kind of facilities the Government have in mind here. There is an important case for a unified approach, which will presumably be possible under the measures proposed.<br><br>
I should not be happy if this far-away quango from Edinburgh or Glasgow, or wherever the headquarters was—it would be interesting if the Minister could tell us that at some stage—were in a position to initiate, of its own accord, redevelopment of a particular housing estate in any neighbourhood anywhere in Scotland, without clear-cut directions and advice from the local authority of the area concerned. I do not want to see Scottish Homes muscling in on a neighbourhood in that way, perhaps creating conflict between different interest groups in that neighbourhood. Any initiative of this nature must be locally based.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 122</span>
We are talking of comprehensive redevelopment which might include the landscaping of an area related to housing, the provision of playgrounds for children, sports fields or other community facilities which all of us want to see, and clearly there is a burning need for such redevelopment in some of our peripheral housing areas.<br><br>
The amendment would clearly establish that the district council for the area concerned should lead any initiative of this nature, and probably act as the agent for Scottish Homes in carrying it out. That makes sense, and I hope that the Minister will accept the spirit of the amendment even if he does not like the drafting of it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that there is a measure of suspicion of the broad range of powers being given to Scottish Homes, although I regret that it should be so. Similar doubts were raised when the Scottish Development Agency was being discussed in Committee in 1975. We can see, from our experience of the SDA, that it can be fully and responsibly controlled by the methods in the Scottish Development Agency Act 1975, and the similar powers which will apply to Scottish Homes in the Bill.<br><br>
Some local authorities may be concerned that their statutory duties are being encroached upon and their functions limited. That is not the intention of the Bill. Far from reducing the powers of local authorities, we are giving them Scottish Homes to act as a partner, to assist them in the carrying out of those statutory duties and functions. That does not imply any criticism of local authorities. Successive Governments have given full support to the work of the Scottish Special Housing Association, which, too, was a willing and able partner of local authorities. Much of the programme of building undertaken by the SSHA was in support of local authorities and took the place of direct action by those authorities. But there was no statutory duty binding the SSHA to assist local authorities; this arose from the spirit of co-operation, good will and partnership which it engendered over its 50 years of life.<br><br>
7 pm<br><br>
I do not see why Scottish Homes, inheriting much of that mantle, should now be bound to all local authorities in the way proposed by the amendment. Apart from the disadvantages for Scottish Homes, so doing places a burden on local authorities in requiring them to divert their attention from their main tasks to those which Scottish Homes is undertaking. There would be bound to be an element of duplication in this.<br><br>
We want Scottish Homes to take a broad view of the action needed to remedy the problems of housing areas. The function is limited to work related to housing, and it will have to consider carefully how it proceeds to avoid overlapping in its actions with those of the SDA and local authorities. But I do not think that we need to make legislation about that.<br><br>
Scottish Homes will deal with environmental improvement in housing areas. It will provide those missing social and community facilities which convert a scheme into a community. Scottish Homes or those whom it is supporting will have teams of workers in those areas who are well able to assess what is required in co-operation with the people living there. I have no doubt that the results will be acceptable to the local community.<br><br>

In its response to the Scottish Homes consultation paper, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities said that it
<br><blockquote><p>"urgently seeks to act, and support any action to improve the problems of the peripheral estates and equivalent areas."</p></blockquote>
In the remainder of its response, COSLA supports the exploration of evey means possible to achieve an early resolution of the problems of multiple deprivation. However, instead of seeing Scottish Homes as just a means, it cast doubt on both the organisation's abilities and its intentions.<br><br>
We must let Scottish Homes prove itself without hampering it at every turn. The amendment would deprive Scottish Homes of all independence of thought and action. It is the reverse of the need for an expansion of our efforts to deal with the problems of the housing environment.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Member for East Lothian understands that it is not our intention to damage the interests of local authorities. It would not be in the interests of the people whom it aims to assist to bind Scottish Homes in the way that he proposes. I hope that he will withdraw his amendment. If he does not, I must ask the Committee to reject it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is totally contrary to the concept and purpose of the Bill. To take the example of the earliest local authority housing schemes in Scotland, the Harewood schemes in Craigmillar in Edinburgh, nothing has been done for them in the way of the facilities to be provided under clause (1)(5)<i>(f)</i> in my lifetime.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. and learned Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have hardly begun, but I may in time. In the peripheral necklace of schemes, people were decamped from the glorious centre of Glasgow, much of which was then flattened, into the 50,000-house schemes of Blackhill, Nitshill, Easterhouse and the like. What have local authorities done under clause 1(3)(f) since they were created? The answer is nothing. The disgrace of Scotland has arisen because those local authorities do nothing but leave populations the size of the city of Perth with no facilities such as the people of Perth, in or out of housing schemes, enjoy.<br><br>
I can understand the hon. Member for East Lothian wanting to perpetuate the problems. Because people are decamped to the perimeters of cities with no facilities, their maudlin feelings of neglect cause them to vote Labour. That cannot be right.<br><br>
One of the great glories of Scotland is that the nonsense about inner cities does not apply. People live in Gorgie, Haymarket, Stockbridge and the inner parts of Glasgow and other cities in thriving communities. Under the clause the Government hope to be able to provide for those who, under unenlightened and brutal policies, were decamped into vast, meaningless, inhumane areas with populations of thousands and no facilities. It is a disgrace. Local authorities, whatever their persuasion, have done nothing. I should be delighted to see a clause which enshrined this purpose and cut out local authorities from the dereliction of duty for which for 50 years they have been responsible.<br><br>
Pilton, for example, was given over to a private company. It was a place where no one in Edinburgh wanted to live. It had a disgraceful name among those honourable people who lived there. Now that it has the facilities which were provided under provision similar to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 124</span>
clause 1(3)(f), all the inhabitants are proud to live there. They returned there because they wanted to live in a Pilton which had facilities and did not have a disgraceful name.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I greatly regret being provoked by the hon. and learned Gentleman. I am sure that the east Pilton and district ratepayers' association will want to comment on what he has said.<br><br>
What we are getting from the Government is not the practicalities but the myth of housing. The Minister said that the wording of the clause will allow works to be undertaken of the type that all hon. Members want to see. The record of his words will show that he said that it will not only "allow" works to be carried out, but they "will" be carried out, as though the Chancellor of the Exchequer was going to give Scottish Homes a blank cheque to allow environmental landscaping and other improvements to be carried out. At the same time he wanted to argue—if he did not, the hon. and learned Gentleman did—that local authorities and other bodies have neglected areas.<br><br>
The reason for the neglect is the restraints that the Government have put on local authorities. If the hon. and learned Gentleman had given way to me, I would have asked him when he last visited Craigmillar. Will he tell us now?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was there on Saturday and Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if he did not see the vast improvements that have been brought about in the past three years by modernising 600 houses. He was either visiting during the night or conditions prevented him from enjoying the benefits.<br><br>
If the hon. and learned Gentleman had gone a few hundred yards down the road to Bingham, he would have seen an estate that was badly neglected, in which the Government were not willing to invest money. They would not allow Edinburgh district council to invest money in it; it could not use up its capital allocation on it, but had to borrow from the industrial bank of Japan because the Government would not grant permission to spend.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman may be my guest next weekend, or of my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Strang), so that we can show him the tremendous improvements that have been made in Bingham, not only in rebuilding the scheme or in planning its rebuilding with the tenants, but in the vital landscaping that the district council was able to co-ordinate, which to some extent is at the heart of the amendment.<br><br>
The Bill, if enacted, will throw up problems of coordination, which at the moment are bad enough, where local authorities, regional and district councils, the SDA, the Scottish Office and now Scottish Homes will be involved in the planning procedure. If we give the new body a co-ordinating role, untried and untested as it is, it will cause chaos and bring about the very opposite of what we want to achieve, which is the sensible spending of money on planned environmental improvements of the type that several Members have been lucky enough to see in their constituencies.<br><br>
My constituency has not benefited, but in the absence of the Secretary of State for Scotland I might again put in a word for Wester Hailes. There have been well-worked-out plans on the drawing board for some years, waiting for the Government to release the necessary cash. If Scottish Homes takes on that co-ordinating role, it will not facilitate the improvements that we seek. If a further tier

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 125</span>
is added, there will be further delays. That is what the Government are courting, together with less spending over a given period.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No one is more delighted than I at the transformation of, for instance, the houses in Craigmillar, Bingham and many places in our cities. They were built by local authorities to a disgraceful standard, in a disgraceful way, as though people did not matter. Many of them have been made to look as though they are fit for people to live in, and they are internally transformed, too. But it does not alter the fact that there are no physical facilities. There are no shops. There is no proper community. They are now improved visually, thank God, and they are infinitely better. I welcome it and I do not care which Government provided the funds for it. They were a disgrace in the first place. Let us have someone with initiative and the power to say, "Let us build some shops and some facilities. Let us bring the place alive as a place in its own account."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Some local authorities have the facilities and the powers, but the Government are making sure that they do not have the money. How the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) can mention Bingham and Craigmillar in one breath and say that the building there was disgraceful escapes me. I admit that Bingham, with Orlit-type building and Bison concrete floors, was never viable. However, Graigmilar was viable. The problems of population density, lack of infrastructure and lack of landscaping facilities were incorporated into the original design, which did not affect the fabric of the buildings—they were built to a very high standard—but which affected the whole community.<br><br>
Many steps have been taken—I am pleased that that was conceded—to try to redress the balance. But we do not need another organisation. We need resources to be used as they were not used before—sensitively, giving people such as the residents of Bingham and Craigmillar a definite say in the way those resources are spent without a local authority, either for paternalistic reasons or to save the ratepayers' cash, dictating how much or how little will be spent and where the resources will go.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree that Birmingham and Craigmillar are not comparable. The original Craigmillar scheme was conceived in the concept that the mere creation of houses of excellence for the poorest and most unfortunate people, would get over their disadvantages and cure their difficulties. That proved to be a false concept. The concept of the Harewood scheme opened by the Earl of Harewood in 1936 was that putting the poorest of people in the grandest of houses, using the most expensive materials and the widest of layouts, with gardens, would cure the problems they faced. That concept was not successful. It was a very good example of how, as the hon. Member said, throwing money at people does not cure the problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Member answers, I do not mind a reference to housing estates to highlight the arguments for the amendment, but we should not go into the history of housing estates in Edinburgh in too much detail.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 126</span>
<p>7.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For a Glaswegian, it is sometimes difficult to use examples from other cities, but I want to take up the example of Pilton, which is germane to the clause.<br><br>
One reason for the disasters of the past was faulty analysis of people's needs and how they might be provided for. I am not reassured by the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross giving us a faulty analysis of the problems and attempted solutions. If ever there were such faulty analyses, Pilton was one. In Pilton, more than £3 million worth of Government money was given to developers to build houses, in return for which a number of council houses were modernised. The net effect was that the local authority houses were maintained on site to a high standard, whereas many of the houses built for home-owners have serious problems that have been highlighted in consumer programmes and in consumer columns in newspapers. They have relied on councillors who were deeply opposed to the concept, such as Alec Wood, for whom they have nothing but praise for the way that he has tried to champion the rights of the new owners in Pilton against some of the disgraceful modernisation by the consortium of Wimpey, Barratt and Miller.<br><br>
The amendment attempts to ensure that the coordination of good initiatives that will benefit local people is done by bodies that have more experience of liaising with residents and tenants and of listening to them. It is a shame that at a time when councils have at last recognised the need to give tenants not only consultation but a definite say in decisions that affect their lives, the Government are going for another tier of organisation which will not proceed along those valuable lines.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Opposition members share many of the concerns expressed by the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn). No one is satisfied with the condition of peripheral estates in Scotland. There is no advantage to be gained in seeking to apportion blame on whoever was responsible for those massive housing estates. The Scottish comedian, Billy Connolly, put it far better than the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross could ever have put it when he described those estates as "deserts wi' windaes". That is exactly what they were. It was a mistake perpetrated by Conservative and Labour Governments and councils because it was generally held when they were constructed that that was the best way to provide housing for people who were living in slums—the poorest people who could not afford owner-occupation at that time. It was a mistake made by everyone. The only exact science is hindsight, and the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross was indulging in a great deal of hindsight when he attacked the decisions made in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s to build those estates. No one would want to repeat those mistakes; we are all trying to move forward and to come to terms with them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I attacked those decisions at the time because I thought they were wrong, and that is on long record.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman is older than he looks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely not.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0148">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 127</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman clearly has gifts which previously went unnoticed in the House. Perhaps we should look back to his younger days, when he was a man of more ability than he shows today.<br><br>
In deciding how to tackle the peripheral estates, we can be certain that we are speaking about putting up finance for environmental improvements. We know that neither Scottish Homes nor anyone else involved in housing in Scotland today will have a bottomless purse: there is a limit to the amount of money which will be available. The Minister seems to be arguing that Scottish Homes will come into a city with some money to invest in environmental improvements, and it will be for Scottish Homes to decide how it can best invest that money. That is where I have difficulty with what the Minister is saying.<br><br>
All the peripheral estates in Dundee have problems. All of them are crying out for more investment in environmental improvement projects. Who decides whether any or which peripheral estate is to receive that investment? The people who are in the best position to identify where the money can best be spent to meet the needs of those with the most acute housing problems is the local authority which knows the local position. It knows where the priorities lie and where the money should be invested.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary of State deliberately said that local authorities would have no say in this matter. He said that Scottish Homes would, for example, be careful not to overlap with the SDA or the local authorities and that it would try to gain the co-operation of local people. But that says nothing about making the decision where the money should go. The local authority will have no say in that, because the Minister said clearly that Scottish Homes would be entirely independent in its thinking and action.<br><br>
Scottish Homes may not be interested in investing money in the peripheral estates. There may be a nice little earner in the centre of Dundee, near the big new waterfront development, where it can invest money in environmental improvement and create a yuppie development or make a lot of money for somebody in the private sector. It may exercise its independence to spend its money there rather than in Whitfield, Fintry, Mid Craigie or Linlathen. That is where I take objection to what the Minister is suggesting. Local authorities know where the needs are and where the money should be spent. Scottish Homes should be working with them to ensure that the money is spent where the need is most acute. That is what we are arguing in the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Notwithstanding what you said earlier, Mr. Martin, about not concentrating on certain Edinburgh housing estates, when I was appointed to the Committee I thought that I would bring to it my experience of housing on a fairly broad spectrum, but I had not taken account of the fact that I would also bring to it my experience as someone who was born in and spent the first few years of his life in the Pilton housing estate scheme. I still have much affection for that area, and I take exception to the points made by the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn), which he would not make if he knew the reality and the history of that area. I know that he is more caring and sensitive than some of his public utterances would have us believe and that he would not make those points lightly, but it is important to bring personal experience into our argument for the amendment.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 128</span>
My experience in growing up in that housing scheme was not of living in a house owned or rented by my parents. As I said earlier, the first five years of my life were spent sharing a house with my grandparents, because there just was not enough housing. The hon. and learned Gentleman, with his pedigree, will remember the promises made by the Government in 1951. It is a belief that is widely held, certainly be me who can only read the history—although I was alive at that time, I was not conscious of what was going on around me, certainly not politically—that that Government won simply on the basis of their promise to build 1 million new houses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</span> <i>indicated dissent.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The history books may need to be revised, but that promise was certain and specific.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was only shaking my head at the phrase "1 million". One of the most disgraceful political episodes was at that time. If the Labour Government said, "We will build 150,000 houses", Mr. Harold Macmillan said "200,000"; if they said ·200,000", he said "250,000". That was why Glasgow was flattened and the rubbish round it built to low standards and all planning controls removed. It is a national political disgrace.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not disagree with anything that the hon. and learned Gentleman has said. Although great efforts were made to fulfil that promise, nobody said that we would get cardboard houses, which is basically what we got.<br><br>
My parents moved to the first house that they had ever occupied on their own in their married life in the Drylaw housing scheme, another slum in Edinburgh.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I know that tales of the tenement are very interesting and enjoyable—[HON. MEMBERS: "Give us one."] I could give the Committee a few. But we must stick to the amendment. I have no objection to the mention of a housing estate, but this is not a debate on the tenements.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I promise you, Mr. Martin, that you will not have my life story, but there is a serious point to what I am saying, and I am coming to that point now.<br><br>
My parents moved to one of the new houses promised by the housing Minister at that time in the Conservative Government, Mr. Macmillan. When I look back at it, I realise that the standard and quality of that house were a disgrace. There was no proper insulation; there were no proper walls—they were plasterboard walls; there was no privacy. But it was a new house and my parents were overjoyed that they had a house of their own for the first time in their lives. That was their reaction. We can look back with hindsight and say that it was wrong and a national disgrace that all the parties were making these promises. It was almost an auction sale, with one saying "We'll bid higher than you", and each of them was looking at quantity and not quality.<br><br>
The houses built in the 1920s and 1930s, which comprised the bulk of the Pilton housing scheme and many of the older schemes, were abandoned by tenants because those glistening new houses were provided—of the sub-standard quality that we now see. But they were attractive to people, who moved into them, and Pilton, Craigmillar and the rest of the estates became slums.<br><br>
We take into account also the rather insensitive renting policies of some local authorities and we see that housing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0149">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 129</span>
has not really progressed. Putting aside for one minute our arguments on homelessness and the waiting lists, I can say that we have made serious strides forward in providing a roof over people's heads, but we have not come near the principle of providing quality housing with the flexibility that people need. We have a view on how such housing should be provided; the Government have a different view.<br><br>
The simple point that I want to make is that throughout this period local authorities of every political colour have striven to provide what they saw as the best for those whom they represented and for whom they had to fight. Local authorities have to some extent been directed by Government policy. If a Government said, "We shall give you £x million to build a housing scheme on the periphery, because that is the current dogma, and that is the only money we shall give you to provide housing for your people", local authorities would snap it up.<br><br>
If the current ideology in planning and housing management says that a multi-storey block is what is to be provided, of course local authorities will take the money, because it will mean more units. Then they can all boast about the number of new houses that they are building. But throughout this process local authorities were attempting to be sensitive to the needs of local people, taking account of what money was available, and they attempted to make that provision.<br><br>
The Bill is attempting to produce a new authority in direct competition with local authorities. Whether the Minister accepts that or not, it is an inevitable consequence of creating an authority of that size and giving it the powers that this authority is being given with the vagueness and lack of controls with which the powers are being given.<br><br>
It is for that reason that I support the amendment, which would oblige the new Scottish Homes to consult local authorities at every level on housing provision. The local authorities have a long track record over decades in making provision for their own areas albeit with the mistakes to which we have all referred. They are the people who know and who are sensitive to local needs, and they should be consulted. Scottish Homes should be obliged to bring them into that process.</span></p>
<p>7.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should love to discuss the whole aspect of Glasgow housing peripheral estates. We have spent too long on the Edinburgh scene. As a product of one of those peripheral estates, I know that there is a generation still around today that was proud to move out to those areas, and we could all with hindsight rewrite history.<br><br>
It is an important amendment, which addresses itself to the responsible authorities in housing up to now which have provided infrastructure. Infrastructure in the main is rate-borne. Certain environmental amenities come from rents, but anything that is built other than housing tends to be rate-borne—sports centres, anything to do with social activities, shops, and so on. If the amendment is not accepted, will any expenditure have to be borne by the rent payers living in that area or will it have to be borne by all the rent payers within the Scottish Homes sector? If so, has any attempt been made to assess the likely cost of such expenditure and how that will impact upon the tenants' rents?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 130</span>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the hon. Member for East Kilbride is no. It will be borne by Scottish Homes itself and not by the tenants. I take an example from Glasgow, which the hon. Gentleman said he wished me to discuss. In that case, it was Glasgow district council that made the decision, in co-operation with the tenants, about which peripheral scheme should be dealt with.<br><br>
We see the activities on a rolling basis, and I have no doubt that Scottish Homes and the local authorities will work together directly on many projects and keep each other informed of their other plans. But there is no need to force that to happen in the way proposed by the amendment, and I urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I moved an amendment dealing with the powers for Scottish Homes to provide funds for the integrated development of housing areas, little did I realise that we should wade into such a highly emotive and emotional debate. I am intrigued by the schizophrenia that seems to afflict Conservative Members when we talk about local authorities in Scotland. We had the Minister giving us a nice, reasonable reply to my introductory speech, saying how he wanted partnership and that there would be consultation and that all was well. But, as soon as he sat down, his hon. and learned Friend the Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) said that local authorities were the fount of all evil and exclusively responsible for the development of the peripheral housing estates that gave rise to so many problems today, that therefore any authority that had been involved in such mistakes in the past should never be allowed to take any strategic decisions about the development of housing areas in the future, and that it would be better if it was handled by a centralised quango.<br><br>
I was interested to note that when the hon. and learned Member sat down, the Minister turned round and nodded vigorously, as though that was what he had wanted to say in the first place. We must make up our minds what the position of Government is towards elected district councils in Scotland. We hear the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross saying that Glasgow district council and Glasgow corporation were responsible for the awful planning mistakes that we all universally accept took place in the manner in which Easterhouse, Castlemilk and Drumchapel were developed. But then he said that in future such decisions must be taken only by central Government. Again, although there are still across-the-board attacks on the principle of local government from Conservative Members, Ministers are still holding up Glasgow district council as a great achiever and innovator. The Minister said again today how clever Glasgow district council had been in diversifying the provision in some of the famous peripheral estates. The Conservative party cannot have it both ways. Either it is for local government and local decision-making or it is against.<br><br>
In my introductory speech, I made it clear that we supported and liked the innovative potential in this part of the clause. When one approaches planning and investment in housing development, it is right to take account of community centres, playgrounds, the environment and so on. We welcome that. We also welcome what we hope will be the provision of new funds for that.<br><br>
But we also know from our own constituency experience that if local authorities up and down Scotland
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0150">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 131</span>
had the wherewithal, they would be only too happy to exercise the powers that the Minister described. We could no doubt all talk about instances in which local authorities had been able to get hold of funds and have built a community centre in a deprived area or had spent some money on landscaping it or had gone into a joint venture with the Scottish Development Agency or anyone else in order to do it.<br><br>
Elected local authorities are demonstrating that they are only too happy to respond to incentives from central Government and to pressure from their own people to develop their own neighbourhoods. That is one thing that has come through loud and clear in this debate from a number of my hon. Friends, who probably have more experience than Conservative Members of life in the housing estates of urban Scotland. I say nothing of my own lack of experience.<br><br>
There are people in those areas who identify with their local communities and who want to see the local communities in the peripheral estates developing themselves and putting forward their own ideas about how their neighbourhoods should be developed. It is surely most appropriate that that should be done through their elected local authorities.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 132</span>
In his initial response to the debate, the Minister said that the amendment would deprive Scottish Homes of its independence of action in this area. That is not good enough. Scottish Homes will be an enabler, it will have funds. But surely the initiation should come from the communities concerned.<br><br>
We ought not to have a quango from Edinburgh or Glasgow dictating how a certain neighbourhood in Edinburgh or Glasgow or anywhere else in Scotland should be developed in the context of this part of the clause. It is far better for the ideas to come from the community councils or from neighbourhood associations or tenants' associations and ultimately from their district councils. It cannot be right that the prime mover in such an enterprise should be Scottish Homes—that faraway quango that is not elected by anyone and is simply nominated by the Secretary of State.<br><br>
I have been interested by the debate, but I am less than satisfied by the Minister's reply and I do not feel minded to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
