	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>120</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On Tuesday I said that my main concern about the original proposals in the consultation paper, apart from the education aspects, was that any proposals for the structure of the school boards should make sense in relation to the proper management and administration of education in our schools. Many of my worries were allayed when we remove some of the executive powers originally proposed for the school boards, the issue no longer has quite the same importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None the less, even though the powers and functions of the new boards are broadly of a consultative nature, there is still an inherent danger of conflict between the decisions of the board and the policy of the education authority at the end of the day. I use that phrase advisedly because the buck eventually stops with the education authority. It is responsible for the administration of the schools within its area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, in carrying out their functions, it is important for the school boards to have regard to both the policy and power of the education authority in order that unnesessary conflict does not arise. That is why my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) and myself tabled amendment No. 3 to clause 5. Its objective is similar to that of amendment No. 19, which was moved by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that my hon. Friend the Minister may say, as I have said, that given the powers and functions of the school boards in the Bill, as opposed to the original consultation paper, the risk of conflict will be less, and thus the group of amendments will be unnecessary. However, I am concerned that the Bill contains provision for the school boards to take further powers—possibly by agreement with the education authority—in which case it could be said that any problems would be ironed out in the process of negotiation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, it would be possible for school boards—if they had a majority of parents—to take more powers against the wishes of the education authority. They would have to make an appeal to the Secretary of State who, if he wished, could give the boards further powers. Therefore, it would be possible for the boards eventually to have further powers, perhaps against the wishes of the education authority. In considering an application from a school board, I am sure that my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State would obviously take into account the dangers of conflict before he would accede to the additional powers requested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point is whether it is right to provide further powers. The opportunity to do so is present in the Bill. If extra powers were taken, it could cause conflict between the school boards and the education authority, which we should be careful to avoid when framing legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I speack to this group of amendments, and especially to amendment No. 3, to ensure that management lines will not be crossed in the new structure, that it is clear where responsibilities lie and that conflict is avoided. Amendment No. 3 is directed
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0820">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>121</span>
to clause 5, but I wish to hear what my hon. Friend the Minister has to say about it at this stage when he replies. He may be able to reassure me. It must be made clear in the Bill where the ultimate responsibility for the management and administration of our schools lies. The group of amendments is useful and I hope that the debate will be constructive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumfries)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to follow my right hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) in speaking to the amendment tabled in our names and to take up what the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) said about the education authority being responsible for education under the Education (Scotland) Act 1980.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 3 is a probing amendment to clause 5. How will education authorities and school boards work together? As my right hon. Friend said, it is vital for them to work in co-operation and harmony rather than conflict. Unless ground rules are laid down, conflict is likely to occur. Like my right hon. Friend I was worried by the original consultation document. I was much happier when we moved from ceiling powers to floor powers, and when the Minister responded to comments that came from throughout Scotland before he drafted the Bill. That helped me enormously, and I hope that it helped education in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that all Ministers set out to draft Bills on the basis that all people are "reasonable", but we know that they are not. Ground rules must be prepared for conflict, and I hope that the Minster will tell us about them this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading I mentioned that I started out in public life as a county councillor in 1952. It was a four-cornered fight with a total electroate of about 1,000. When one comes from a small local authority, a much closer relationship exists between the regional or district councillor and his electorate. One does not want elected councillors to feel that they are being passed by the school board when education policy is decided. That is crucial. What will be the structure of policy-making between the education authority and the school board? How shall we resist policy when the school board makes decisions that conflict with the overall policy of the education authority?.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is stated many times in the Bill that the Board will consider advice and take account of education policy, but where is the crunch? When does the education authority say, "Sorry chaps, you have gone too far"? Can the board take a firm stance and make decisions that conflict with those of the education authority?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will remove those fears from my mind by saying that everthing will be straight and level and that there will be no problem. We would be foolish to press on with further discussion of the Bill without being clear about how the relationship between the school boards, of which there will be an enormous number, and the education authorities, of which there are relatively few, will proceed in future. I want good results, good co-operation and co-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>122</span>
ordination, and not the conflict that could take place because of a marked difference in policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, local government is political. Strarthclyde has a Labour education authority whereas a remote area of south Ayrshire might have a Conservative school board. Organising conflicts might be part of the proceedings. The conflict between the policy and decision-making of the school boards and the overall policies of the education authority should be minimised. I hope that the Minister will tell us how that will be done in practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Worthington 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clydebank and Milngavie)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One good thing to happen in recent years is that the policies of regional education authorities have been more explicit. The hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) can go back considerably further than I can, but I remember being selected as a candidate and asking the old Dumbarton county council what its policies were. That caused panic and consternation along the direcorate's corridor because no one had asked that before and nothing had been produced before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That explicitness of policy is to be welcomed. The electorate should be clear what it is voting for in regional elections. Local authorities are given responsibility for policy and they must be clear that those policies should be carried out by the schools and school boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Strathclyde, area curriculum planning groups have been set up and begun to yield good rewards When considering the resources for an area, it is encouraged to bring toghether, especially at the later secondary stage, the secondary schools of the area, the community education services, the careers service and the colleges of further education. That is leading to better planning and a better use of resources for minority languages and the development of modular education courses. Some schools and school boards might be hostile to that and might constantly demand resources for their schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another gain has been a lessening of their religouus divide, The unthinkable is now occuring and senior pupils from Catholic Schools are going to non-demoniational schools and vice versa. Adults in schools is another education initiative which has had tremendous success. In some schools several hundred adults now sit alongside pupils of normal school age. But when the initiative was first implemented, its faced considerable resistance. In my area parents telephoned and said, "We are not having any Tom, Dick or Harry sitting alongside our kid in school." The school was seen as a children's enclave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should be made clear to the school boards that that is the policy—and a highly successful one—of the elected education authority. It should be the duty of the school board to promote that policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another example is the letting of schools. The Bill is quaint and old-fashioned because it referes to almost obsessively to school pupils—meaning five to 16-year-olds and sixth form pupils—and neglects the adult movement. It refers to schools almost as the possession of the main daytime users rather than as the main community resource of the area. Education
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0821">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>123</span>
authorities—despite lack of funds—have tried to encourage more extensive use of schools throughout the day and evening and throughout the year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At school council meetings I have been conscious of tension between parents and community users of the school. Parents have tried to restrict community use and to exclude others from the school. Parents might think that it is in their interest to restrict community use but in terms of value for money it is not in the interest of the community as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have given three examples of legitimate education authority policies which it should be the duty of the school board to facilitate rather than to obstruct. It is legitimate for the school board to make representations to the education authority to change its policies—I do not quarrel with that. However, having taken account of those representations, the education authority has the right and the duty to lay down its policies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate on this useful set of probing amendments aimed at clarifying the exact relationship between the school board and the education authority. I am grateful to my right hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) and my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) for pressing me on that. We have considered carefully the statutory position of school boards in relation to their education authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments seek to constrain school boards and head teachers in the exercise of their functions. They seek to require them to act in accordance with the statutory duties of the education authority and within the policies of that authority. In response to my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries, there is already a provision to require boards to act in accordance with the education authority's statutory duties in clause 8(5). Indeed, clause 8(5) goes much further and requires the board to act in accordance with the authority's obligations under common law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciated what my right hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside said about policy and about avoiding conflict where it is unnecessary. Clause 9 requires a board to have regard to the local authority's policy on the curriculum when exercising its functions under that clause. The Bill also provides for boards to be directed on the authority's policy on the out-of-hours use of school premises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities will be able to attach conditions to the delegation orders, which may reflect particular policy guidelines that operate within the education authority. We hope and expect that local authorities will take the opportunity offered by the orders to devolve power according to conditions that meet the parameters for their particular policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments go too far in seeking to constrian the boards to act wholly within education authority policy. That is difficult to accept because of the nature of the Bill and the spirit behind it. What is the point of giving boards delegated powers and functions if they are required to act in accordance with detailed central instructions? One of the Oppositions's unfair
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>124</span>
criticisms of the Government is that we are centralising, yet the amendments seek to advance education authorities' central power in matters that are properly left for decision at local level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept what my right hon. and hon. Friends said about the need to reflect the agency relationship that will exist between boards and the authorities and the obligation of the boards to their authorities. I hope that I have reassured my right hon. and hon. Friends how the Bill does that. There are some teeth in the Bill, which will reassure those members of the Committee who are worried about the boards' obligations. Schedule 4 amends section 70 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 and gives the Secretary of State power to take default action against school boards in the same way that he can take action against an education authority that fails in its statutory duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The boards' obligations to their authorities are clear. We have drafted the Bill in such a way as to ensure an appropriate degree of freedom of action at local level within the context of a relationship of mutual confidence backed by the authority or the Secretary of State. Therefore, I urge my right hon. and hon. Friends and the hon. Member for Cumberanuld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) to withdraw the amendments. The Bill already provides for the spirit of what they seek.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful in some respects for the Minister's assurances. It is reassuring to know that the boards will have to operate within the duties that statute imposes on education authorities and that those authorities will have the power to direct votes on the out-of-hours use of school buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 15, school boards, in co-operation with LEAs, can agree to have delegated powers, which can be made conditional. However, it will be possible for school boards to seek and obtain such delegated powers through the medium of the Secretary of State for Scotland and in opposition to LEAs wishes. The Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), did not deal with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman. He is correct. If there were a difference of view between the education authority and the school board about delegated powers, the school board could pursue the matter with the Secretary of State. However, the Bill makes it clear that the Secretary of State would not be available to act as a court of appeal unless the school board could successfully obtain the endorsement of the majority of parents in a ballot. As the hon. Gentleman associated himself with earlier amendments where he argued that account should be taken of a ballot of parents, surely that approach should be acceptable to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As usual the point that I wanted the Minister to answer has not been answered. The Minister has said that I am correct: school boards will be able to take on delegated powers through the medium of the Secretary of State for Scotland if they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0822">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>125</span>
are in conflict with the local education authority, so it will not be possible for that LEA in those circumstances to make those delegated powers conditional on whatever policy the education authority implements locally. Thus school boards could take on delegated powers that would bring them into conflict with the local education authority, albeit with the support of a majority of parents. The Minister underestimates the potential for conflict that may arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the right hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro), I welcome the fact that for the most part the Bill deals with floor powers rather than ceiling powers, but the potential for access to ceiling powers remains. We are dealing with the executive function of school boards, and there is a high potential for conflict between school boards and local education authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members drew the Minister's attention to the division between an urban-dominated education authority such as Strathclyde and small rural areas. My hon. Friend the Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) said that there might be a sectarian division between a school board and load education authority. I know of a Catholic secondary school in Dundee where the first-year intake is almost 50 per cent. non-Catholic. A school board with executive powers might not like that, and that could bring it into conflict with an education authority that was trying to encourage the integration of pupils</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should underline the position. The Bill provides that the Secretary of State would not be able to grant delegated powers to a school board unless he were satisfied that such delegated powers would not prejudice the good running of the school. The Bill provides that backstop. The hon. Gentleman is not making a clear distinction between the board being in conflict with the education authority's statutory duties and the board being in conflict with its policies, which is rather different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am giving concrete examples but the Minister gives me no reassurance on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier the Minister said that it would be possible for the elections to school boards to be conducted on party-political lines. School boards within a local authority's area should be dominated by one political party that had succeeded in getting a majority of parents elected to that board and who would pursue party-political objectives in education matters that were in conflict with the party policies of the education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not answered my question about the potential for conflict, neither has he reassured me that confusion and conflict will not arise in the line of management and responsibility from the Government through regional councils and down to school boards. He should accept our amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<li>The Secretary of State shall arrange for a secret postal ballot to be held on the question of whether grant-maintained status should be sought where he receives a written request for such a ballot from a number of parents of registered pupils at the school equal to at least 20 per cent. of the number of registered pupils at the school on the date on which the request is received.</li>
	<li>The Secretary of State may ask the School Board to conduct the ballot, or make such other arrangements as he considers appropriate.</li>
	<li>Where the result of a ballot held in accordance with subsection (2) above shows a simple majority in favour of seeking grant-maintained status for the school, the Secretary of State shall publish a draft instrument in acccordance with which the school is to be governed (to be known as the articles of government).</li>
	<li>After consultation with the education authority, the articles of government of the school shall be made by order of the Secretary of State. The articles will provide for the constitution of a board of management for the grant-maintained school.</li>
	<li>On an incorporation date determined by the Secretary of State in relation to a grant-maintained school, the property rights and liabilities of the education authority formerly responsible for the school shall be transferred to, and by vurtue of this Act rest in, the board of management of the grant-maintained school.".</li>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 10 is a paving amendment for new clause 1, which deals with grant-maintained schools. Many important people would have been extremely disappointed if I had not moved the amendment. I refer, of course, to 200 of my constituents who wrote urging me to do so. I received 2,900 letters asking me to move an amendment to provide for what is commonly known as opting out. Judging from my mailbag, the oppposition to my proposals is the same as the opposition to my position on the Scottish Select Committee. I have not reeived a single letter from individuals opposing my position on either issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman claims that he has overwhelming public support from his constituency for his proposals. May I remind him of a meeting in a secondary school in his constituency last November? About 120 people attended that meeting to consider ceiling powers and about 110 of them opposed those powers. The logical inference is that if they opposed ceiling powers, they would certainly be against opting out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That meeting was about ceiling powers, but the hon. Gentleman's logical inference is inaccurate. I shall return to that later because it is fundamental to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During Second Reading, the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) asked me whether I intended to press the amendment to a Division. As the hon. Gentleman knows, I am always anxious to give him the fullest possible information about my voting intentions. Seldom can a Conservative Member have moved an amendment against a background of so many Government statements that they would not accept it, and that was before they heard my argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Committee knows, my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State announced that, if necessary, he will use his famous gatling-gun to deny Scottish parents the rights that English parents will have under the Education Reform Bill. The Opposition are generally against the provisions, but I live in hope. They are hon. Members of wisdom, knowledge and open minds. At least, I had hoped that they were, until I learnt that some of their speeches had been given to the press before my arguments had been heard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of us have been told this morning what the Minister's response will be, so the hon. Gentleman can hardly complain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I am not complaining about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition's major criticisms of school board do not apply to opting out because that involves neither compulsion nor extra public expenditure costs. My right hon. and learned Friend's intentions are clear, but, with fiendish cunning, I shall outmanoeuver him. I give the Committee notice that at the end of the debate I intend to withdraw amendment No. 10.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had hoped that this debate would have taken place earlier in our proceedings. As I have already told the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall), I shall not be here on Tuesday morning because of a Council of Europe meeting in Strasbourg. Therefore, if the debate continues until Tuesday morning, the amendment will be dealt with by my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker), who has kindly said that he supports it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall describe briefly amendment No. 10 and the new clause. They make it clear that school boards may or may not be the mechanism whereby grant-maintained status—so-called opting out—is achieved. Therefore—I return to the point made by
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>128</span>
the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington)—I challenge the assumption that supporters and opponents of opting out have made, that there is a continuum from floor powers to ceiling powers. Although it is conceivable, school boards are neither a sufficient nor a necessary precondition for opting out. Although the two concepts are related, they are fundamentally different because school boards are about the involvement of parents whereas opting out is about choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman concede that he is contradicting the Secretary of State, who said that opting out could not yet be considered in Scotland because of the absence of the tradition of school governors and parental involvement at school board level? He also said that the necessary prerequisite to opting out was the establishment of a tradition of school boards with ceiling powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. I am contradicting the Government's assumption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 10 refers to the 1980 Act. Even before the Bill is enacted the Secretary of State has powers to finance opting out. Section 73 of the 1980 Act empowers him to make regulations to provide for, among other things,
	<br><q><p>"the payment of grants to the managers of educational establishments"</p></q>
and
	<br><q><p>"to any other persons providing education or educational services".</p></q>
Sections 74 and 75 are consequential on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, those powers have been used. It is sometimes alleged that opting out is new, unique or alien, but a grant-maintained school in Scotland—Jordanhill school—opts out in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 1 sets out a possible framework for grant-maintained status. Naturally it is much shorter than the provisions in the Education Reform Bill, which are about 30 clauses long. If the Scottish Office has been examinng the new clause with its customary comprehensiveness, my hon. Friend the Minister will have a brief that says that it contains about 140 technical inadequacies. The new clause is illustrative, rather than comprehensive; I do not pretend that it covers every possible technical point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The introduction of grant-maintained status in Scotland is not a legislatively complex task because of the existing powers to which I have already referred. New clause 1 provides that if the Secretary of State receives a request for a ballot from 20 per cent. of parents, he will arrange—perhaps via a school board—for a ballot of all parents. If that results in a show of support for grant-maintained status, he will produce a draft instrument of management, consult the local authority and then publish articles of government to provide, 	<i>inter alia,</i> for the constitution of a board of management for the grant-maintained school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities has made a submission to all Members of the Committee, including through normal courtesy, me. No doubt,

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>129</span>
many of its points will come up during the debate, but I wish to comment briefly on some of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
COSLA's most important claim is that the proposal threatens the lone-standing education system in Scotland. That is linked with the claim that parents do not appear to support the idea of opting out. I challenge both claims, and they cannot both be true. If the Government introduce legislative provision for opting out and there is no parental support for it, nothing will happen. The statute book will merely contain a provision that will not be used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
COSLA says that school boards are to be the mechanism to facilitate opting out. As I have made clear, that may or may not be the case. COSLA also says that there may be problems if, for example, opting out left an outstanding debt with the authority. New clause 1 covers that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
COSLA criticises the possibility that opted-out schools would charge fees. It is absolutely clear to anyone who has studied the debates on the Education Reform Bill that opted-out schools would not have the power to charge fees. The schools would not be like the old direct grant schools in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not the case that schools, or parents associated with schools, that are likely to try to opt out are schools in which discontent has arisen between the school community and the education authority for some reason? Overall, there is no parental demand in Scotland for the provision and its use would be confined to those school communities that find themselves in conflict with their education authorities. That would distort the quality of the comprehensive provision of education over an authority's area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that. The example that I wish to give highlights some recent decisions by Strathclyde regional council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition cannot have it both ways. They cannot say both that there is no demand for opting out and that opting out would have terrible consequences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a useful debating ploy always to attack people who criticise a proposal. Will the hon. Gentleman assure me that he will give some justification for the opt-out suggestion later in his contribution?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am just about to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are arguments in principle and in practice. There are a full range of possiblities on parental choice. I wish to deal with one aspect of parental choice—the wish of some communities, particularly ethnic minorities, to have single-sex education. The question arises because of recent rationalisation proposals in Strathclyde.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members may have listened to the Radio Clyde talk-in on Sunday 17 April. The two speakers were the excellent Conservative councillor for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>130</span>
Eastwood, North, Peter Edmondson, and Councillor Malcom Green, the chairman of the education committee. The issue of single-sex schools was debated at some length, in a particularly revealing way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Mr. Keegan from Baillieston rang in and asked why the single-sex schools were being closed. Was it a deliberate policy of the Labour group, or was it coincidenatal? Dr. Green answered:
	<br><q><p>"there has been a great debate in the Labour Group, I think everybody is aware of that, on this issue and the great majority of Labour members appear to feel that single sex education is in the words of a number of people who have argued this way is an anachronism, and should be done away with."</p></q>
He went on to say:
	<br><q><p>"I don't personally take that view".</p></q>
Councillor Edmonston said that the Conservative group was in favour of allowing the continuation of single-sex schools, such as Our Lady and St. Francis and Notre Dame. Those are the two schools in Glasgow which have had most publicity although I believe that there are also schools in the contituency of the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) where the issue has arisen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Keegan then said:
	<br><q><p>"we have been told privately by Labour Councillors that this is their policy to remove the choice from parents."</p></q>
He was referring to the choice to have single-sex schools. Dr. Green confirmed that, saying:
	<br><q><p>"Those who supported the closure of Our Lady and St. Francis and Notre Dame in Glasgow and by implication Notre Dame in Dumbarton, although that hasn't been so locally controversial … said they believed very strongly that the girls would benefit both socially and educationally from being educated in a co-education atmosphere."</p></q>
The interviewer said:
	<br><q><p>"But ethnic minorities simply don't want their daughters to go to a co-educational school."</p></q>
That is the point; it is the nub of the debate. It is interesting to note Dr. Green's reply. He said:
	<br><q><p>"That was the very point that I made to the Education Committee, I'm afraid this appears to have been ignored or dimissed as being a marginal issued."</p></q>
The position, therefore, is clear: the regional council has decided to close those two girls' schools in Glasgow—Our Lady and St. Francis and Notre Dame—because the majority of the ruling group is in principle against single-sex education. That is the issue which members of the Committee should consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The closures are not about normal rationalisation. They are opposed strongly by the parents and by hon. Members who represent the constituencies involved. It is my understanding that the hon. Member who represents the constituency covering Our Lady and St. Francis supports the school. I know for certain that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead Mr. Galloway supports the continuation of Notre Dame school in his constituency. Opting-out is essential in this case because, of the two schools, Notre Dame comes under the new regulations covering school closures, so it would be referred to my right hon. And

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>131</span>
learned Friend the Secretary of State. There is some debate about Our Lady and St. Francis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has been kind enough on other occasions to concede that there must be some cut in the school provision in Stratclyde because of the surplus of places. Every set of parents involved in every school in Stratclyde is against their school closing. It is their choice that the school should not close. How can those points be reconciled?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is correct. I have consistently supported Strathclyde's wish to rationalise school education in principle. Indeed, I have gone further than that: I have said publicly to my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State and to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State that they should be assisted in that process by a favourable capital allocation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The closure of those two extremely popular schools is not connected with the rationalisation of school places. It is clear from the radio broadcast that the reason for closure is that the regional council has decided in principle that it will not have single-sex schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Lewis Moonie(Kirkaldy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason for closure is that there is a surplus of places in the Roman Catholic sector schools. The decision to choose those schools rather than any other is because they are single-sex, but the primary reason for closure is the surplus of places.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the reason for the programme, but we are concentrating on the position of the two schools. The Catholic hierarchy could object to both closures on denominational grounds, but my information—which I will happily retract if it is innaccurate, and my hon. Friend may know whether it is—is that Archbishop Winning and the hierarchy, perfectly understandably, are not proposing to do that. There is no obvious case on purely denominational grounds because Catholic education for the pupils will be provided elsewhere. As Our Lady and St. Francis would not come under either my right hon. and learned Friend's regulations or the existing safeguards, there is no way in which that school can be saved except by otping out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I just develop the case? I have been generous in giving way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The school is strongly supported by parents. That is not in doubt. It is an excellent school whether it be judged by examination results, popularity or any other criterion. That is not in doubt. It is being closed not solely for rationalisation purposes, but because the regional council has taken a decision in principle against single-sex education. It is reasonable for central Government to say, "We support parental rights, and we are, in principle, in favour of people—in this case Catholics and those from the Moslem community—having the right to single-sex
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>132</span>
education." If that is to be denied, central Government have an obligation to provide the choice for a school to continue under grant-maintained status at no extra cost to public expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is fundamental in the issue of choice. The parents to whom the hon. Gentleman refers choose to keep their school open because they prefer single-sex education. Parents in other areas may want to keep their school open because it is the neighbourhood school, where they went to school themselves, because it is in a deprived area or because of the danger involved in going to another school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no infinite choice. The hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) will agree that the choice of keeping one school open does not expand the choices available; it simply means that the pressure is placed elsewhere to close down another school for different reasons. Does he agree that it is impossible to give all parents their choice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the sense that the hon. Gentleman argued it, the hon. Gentleman is correct. If school education is being rationalised, it is impossible to give every parent the choice of continuing their child's education at a school when that parent cannot be persuaded to move to another school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a difference between an education authority genuinely trying to rationalise educational provision on educational grounds and proposing a school for closure on the grounds that it does not accept that, for example, ethnic minorities should have the right to send their daughters to a single-sex school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much public attention has been paid to Paisley grammer. It comes under my right hon. and learned Friend's regulations, but there is widespread suspicion that if he decides that it should continue—it is up to him to decide whether is shall, if and when the case is put to him—it will be run down. When the present rector retires this session—I put this as neutrally as I can—his successor might not be wholly imbued with the traditions of the school. The education authority has a great deal of power to run down a school if it chooses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The relevance of an opting-out provision for Paisley grammer is that, first, parents could choose whether it is to continue. Secondly, the existence of that safeguard would almost certainly be a strong incentive for the education authority not to take decisions biased against the school. That is why I have had so many letters from parents with children at Paisley grammer asking for an opting-out provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry for showing my slight impatience. I have listened with interest to the hon. Gentleman's case for opting-out. Two specific examples have been given in relation to Strathclyde. I must remind the hon. Gentleman that four fifths of the population of Scotland live outside the Glasgow area. We are being given two examples today to highlight what, if the new clause were accepted, would be a massive change in educational policy in Scotland. What about half of the population outwith

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>133</span>
Strathclyde and their different educational problems and the four fifths outside Glasgow? Can a case be made within that context to justify the extraordinary new clause 1?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not surprising that the cases that I have put to the Committee should be in the Glasgow and Renfrewshire area as it is the area that I represent. Whether opting-out was implemented in the rest of Scotland would entirely depend on parents. There is no obligatioin on parents anywhere to choose opting-out unless they wish so to so. My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker), who has added his name to my amendment, may wish to talk about conditions in his area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman leaves the issue of Paisley grammar, will he say why the 200 parents to whom he referred earlier want their children to go to that school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are exercising their preference to do so, but this is not an implied criticism of schools in my constituency. People have chosen to send their children to Paisley grammar because, for example, it has an extremely good and highly specialised music department. They are exercising their choice. The majority of the letters that I have received about Paisley grammar school opting-out are from people outside the catchment area only because they are my constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a point of principle and a point of practice to put to my hon. Friend the Minister. The point of principle is that grant-maintained status will be available to parents in England and it is already available to parents in the west end of Glasgow, whose children go to Jordanhill school. On what grounds of equity do the Government justify giving an important right to parents in England and in the west end of Glasgow but not to those in other parts of Scotland? The point of practice is, how do a Government who believe in choice and deversity justify what is happening at Our Lady and St. Francis school? Unless it is able to opt-out fairly quickly, that school will close, not because of rationalisation but because the regional council has decided not to respect the wishes of parents from the Catholic and ethnic minority communities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Mc Fall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is normal for the Chairman to call hon. Members from alternative sides of the Committee. However, hon. Members must rise more quickly if they wish to be called.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have an opportunity to speak briefly to the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart). I do not agree with my hon. Friend, he has
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>134</span>
done a service to the Committee and to people outside by giving us the opportunity to debate the issue of opting-out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have considerable sympathy with the intervention made by the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish). He said that my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood had raised the issue of opting-out largely with reference to one school in Glasgow. My hon. Friend gave examples to support his case and spoke of equity and so on. None the less those who come from elsewhere in Scotland—where four fifths of Scottish children are educated—are naturally hesitant about the amendment and new clause. I would find it difficult to justify applying to my area the principle that my hon. Friend put forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not criticise my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood for having tabled his amendment and new clause but it is wholly the wrong vehicle for bringing forward such a measure at this time. The purpose of the Bill is to set up school boards to encourage more parental involvement in schools. That worthwhile new idea, which has broad acceptance throughout Scotland, came close to being fatally damaged by the nature of the original proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure has not been without controversy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that fact and that the Government have brought forward provisions, which are broadly acceptable throughout Scotland, to meet an objective that most people in Scotland support, it would be detrimental to the success of school boards to include an item such as co-option in the Bill. On those grounds alone, my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State and my hon. Friend the Minister are right not to use the Bill as a vehicle for my hon. Friend's proposals. I strongly support the Government on those strictly practical grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this issue is to be dealt with properly, it should be dealt with on its merits in a Bill different to this important one. I acknowledge that my hon. Friend has done a service by giving us the opportunity to have a general debate on this important, albeit controversial, topic. It is right that hon. Members should discuss it and make their views known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend made a valid point that those who criticised him and his proposals used contradictory arguments. He argued that if parents in Scotland did not demand this provision, as his critics alleged, there was no fear in bringing this forward and adopting it in legislation. Equally, it can be argued that if there is no demand for it, the Government would be wrong to waste legislative time putting unnecessary and unwanted proposals on the statute book. This is not the time to legislate; we should be practical. I was, for weel or woe, a Minister and much of my time was spent resisting unwanted and unnecessary legislation. There is always pressure for more legislation, enabling powers and so on, but such a controversial issue must be debated in the context of a specific demand and not in vaccuo.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am little surprised that, given my right hon. Friend's experience of the Department of Energy and knowledge of the Department of Transport, he states that no legislation should be

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>135</span>
introduced until there is a demand. Licensing is a prime example of authority given to Government Departments to act as and when the demand occurs—for example, through licenses for aviation routes, exploration and energy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a fundamental mistake. He relates this proposal to a practical, administrative matter such as licensing. This issue strikes at the heart of education. It is fundamental to different views of eduation. The principle of licensing has been debated, whether for energy or transport, and has been accepted. It has passed into legislation, and administration and enabling powers have been given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are debating the principle of opting-out, which strikes at the character of Scottish education and would change it. It should be dealt with on its own. To be fair to my hon. Friend, he has said that he will withdraw this amendment. I welcome debate, but to use the Bill as a vehicle would be wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may not have heard my right hon. Friend correctly, but he should not misinterpret the argument. Our opponents argue that there is no demand, but I believe that there is. It might not be universal. There might not be any demand in my right hon. Friend's constituency, so no school would apply to opt out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, and I acknowledge it by saying that I am neither qualified nor able to comment on the specific position in the area of Scotland to which my hon. Friend referred. I would not impute to him any wrong motives or wrong analysis of his area.

I do not deny that there might be a demand in my hon. Friend's area, but in my part of Scotland—Aberdeen, Kincardine and Deeside and in Grampian generally—there is no demand for opting out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr right hon. Friend speaks about an area that I know well because I was educated there. Will he acknowledge that some parents opt out of the state system and send their children to independent schools? Will he consider the argument that many parents who cannot afford to pay for education do not have the opportunity to opt out that many people in the north-east have?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A very small proportion of parents in the north-east opt out into the private sector. The same applies to medicine. There is an opportunity to opt out, but the principle here is different. This is opting out within the state system of education—setting up within the existing system a structure that is administered by local education authorities. A dual system of education—a private sector and a public sector—has been the tradition in Scotland since the move away from church schools to school boards in each area, although grant-aided schools existed at one time. The amendment suggests the introduction of a third system of schools within the state sector to be administered centrally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With respect to my hon. Friend he belittles, as does
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>136</span>
my hon. Friend for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker), the point of principle. The principle is new, although my hon. Friend for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) will say that parents at Jordanhill school have the option to opt out. I acknowledge that change occurs and that no systems are exactly the same, but many people think, as I do, that to introduce this element on a general basis is the result of a point of principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem has arisen because of school closures. There is now provision for appeal to my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State, although I appreciate that the amendment would go further than that. Demand for opting out is not evident. I cannot speak for every area of Scotland but questions were raised at every election meeting in my part of Scotland about the opting-out proposal for England and Wales, which came out of the blue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that my experience is shared by other Conservative Members. I had the opportunity to test public opinion on the proposal because it was introduced during a general election campaign. I held up to four election meetings an evening. I covered a wide area, including parts of Aberdeen, parts of the rural area of Kincardine and Deeside and towns such as Stonehaven and Banchory—all well populated areas. No one expressed a desire to opt out at any of those meetings. People said that the policy was not appropriate for Scotland now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The experience of my right hon. Friend is not necessarily the experience of all Conservatives. I held four meetings during the election at which the opting-out proposal was raised. My constituents are aware that the 40 per cent. over capacity in Dundee is affecting the provision of education in rural areas. They are very upset by that. They are considering the options, one of which is opting out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not attempted to say what may have been the experience in other areas of Scotland. I acknowledge what my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood said. He knows of a particular problem. It must exist or he would not have mentioned it. However, I am not convinced that he has the right answer to the problem even in his part of Scotland. I try to speak only of what I know and from experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of opting out came out of the blue, as my hon. Friends must admit. I had to telephone those whom one telephones to seek advice when things come out of the blue during an election campaign. It took some time to identify exactly what was proposed, to what it applied and whether Scotland would be affected. I was told firmly that the proposal had arisen from special circumstances, mainly in relation to London, and that it applied only to England and Wales, certainly not to Scotland. I spent the remainder of my election meetings reassuring my constituents that opting out would not apply in Scotland. Having made my views clear, I did not lose a minute's sleep or any votes over it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no demand for these proposals in Scotland.

If they are to be brought forward, it should be done when there is evidence of more general demand. I am reassured that my hon. Friend the Minister will not recommend acceptance of the amendment. Indeed, in moving it, my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood said that he did not intend to pursue it to a conclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[SIR HECTOR MONRO 	<i>in the chair.</i>]</p>
	<p>I shall finish on a point that I made in passing and which I had intended to make more of. The proposals strike a fundamental blow to the current Scottish education system. There may be a time when they are appropriate and in demand, but in the face of the present lack of demand and the realisation that they would create a new element in Scottish education, it is wrong to pursue them now.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall open for the Opposition and speak against new clause 1 and amendment No. 10.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the thrust of the argument of the right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith). The amendment has been introduced by a failed Under-Secretary of State for Scotland who had responsibility for education. In challenging the assumption of the Government, he has shown that his future is behind him. His proposal should be seen in that light.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is this the standard of the argument?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. Sometimes one can be surprised by the originality of the amendments proposed in Committee, but not in the case of new clause 1, which was proposed by the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart). It is the best trawled surprise of the parliamentary Session, in his eyes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recently the Scottish media gave us an accurate picture of the Government's intentions for Scottish schools. I am referring to the infamous correspondence between the Scottish Office and the Prime Minister's office. A letter, headed "Opting Out in Scotland", was quoted in the 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> on 30 March. It stated:
	<br><q><p>"The Prime Minister is glad that your Secretary of State is now going to develop, for inclusion in next session's Scottish Education Bill, a scheme whereby the schools in Scotland can opt out of local authority control."</p></q>
I detect a frisson of excitement running through Westminster in anticipation of the Secretary of State's statement about future policy. That letter continues:
	<br><q><p>"The Prime Minister agrees, too, that the Goverment's future policy should be spelled out in response to the Amendment".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. DAVID KNOX 	<i>in the Chair.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether my hon. Friend would agree that it is unfortunate that the Secretary of State, who is a member of the Committee, is not here today when his civil servants have promised us a statement by him on the future of Scottish education and, in particular, opting out.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>138</span>
Does my hon. Friend think that a statement will come from the Under-Secretary of State?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's comment is consistent with what has happened in regard to the leaked letter. The Secretary of State has been left out of many other discussions, and he is certainly not in the picture this morning. The letter states:
	<br><q><p>"The Prime Minister agrees, too, that the Government's future policy should be spelled out in response to the Amendment which Allan Stewart is expected to put down to this session's School Boards (Scotland) Bill. Your Secretary of State will no doubt wish to ensure that Mr. Stewart does indeed table a suitable amendment which could prompt the Secretary of State's statement about future policy."</p></q>
This morning we have visible proof of the accuracy of the 	<i>Glasgow Herald.</i> The hon. Member for Eastweed has been used as a stalking horse for the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) must withdraw that remark. On Second Reading the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) asked me about precisely this point. My answer was that I had written to the Prime Minister and to other Ministers sometime ago about the Paisley grammer issue and said the I was proposing to table this amendment. At no time had I discussed the matter with the Prime Minister or anyone at No. 10 Downing Street. The hon. Member for Linlithgow, who is one of the most courteous Members of the House, told me afterwards that he fully accepted what I had said. Therefore, the hon. Member must withdraw his allegation of consipracy and stalking horses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can only go by the article in the the 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> on 30 March. It is on that basis that I make that assertion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are calling me a liar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am certainly not. With my cornflakes on that morning I read that the hon. Member for Eastwood would table such an amendment. The hon. Member mentioned a continuum between the floor and ceiling powers of the Bill. I see a continuum between the article on 30 March and the amendment. It is on that basis that I make that judgment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman has just called me a liar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am not sure what the hon. Gentleman said, but it might be as well if he reworded it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has refused to withdraw his allegation. My intention of putting forward an opting-out amendment was well known long before the article in the 	<i>Glasgow Herald.</i> It has been well known for months to anyone who

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>139</span>
wished to ask. It was in the press, not that it was a matter of great moment. The hon. Member for Linlithgow assured me that he accepted my word that I was not involved in any kind of conspiracy with No. 10 Downing Street.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dumberton (Mr. McFall) clearly said that he is not accepting my statement in answer to the question put by the hon. Member for Linlithgow. The hon. Member for Dumberton should withdraw his allegation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, because I base my allegation on the article that appeared on 30 March. I did not mention conspiracy. My conclusions are based on the article, which makes no reference to Second Reading or to discussions with my hon. Friend the Member for Linlinthgow (Mr. Dalyell). I contend that my conclusion is justified on the basis that the amendment has been tabled. I am not privy to any information that the hon. Gentleman had about opting out or with whon he had discussion. My information came from the article in the 	<i>Glasgow Herald.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should have the grace to accept what my hon. Friend said. I assure him that the Government were well aware of my hon. Friend's intention to table an amendment to the Bill in Committee since the early part of the summer. Indeed, my hon. Friend used every conceivable parliamentary opportunity to remind us of that. That is a matter of record. The hon. Gentleman cannot use the 	<i>Glasgow Herald,</i> of all newspapers, as a basis on which to challenge what my hon. Friend says. I hope that he hon. Gentleman will withdraw his imputation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am astounded. To use a favourite phrase of the Under-Secretary of State. It takes my breath away that the Minister should impugn the 	<i>Glasgow Herald,</i> which is a quality paper in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may wish to reflect on the fact that we used the comment from the 	<i>Glasgow Herald.</i> To be fair to that newspaper, however, it used a letter from the Prime Minister's office which states:
	<br><q><p>"The Prime Minister agrees, too, that the Government's future policy should be spelled out in response to the Amendment which Allan Stewart is expected to put down to this session's School Boards (Scotland) Bill."</p></q>
Does my hon. Friend agree that what is given out in idealogical statements or in discussions with his hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), are very different from a letter from the Prime Minister's office which indicates that there is a conspiracy outwith the democratic discussions taking place in Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) has put the case admirably. The letter was leaked to the 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i>; no one has refuted the fact that the letter came from the Prime Minister's office. I have quoted that letter and I base my conclusion on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>140</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) to say whether that letter came from the Prime Minister's office or whether it was a fake?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. I have not seen the letter, although of course I saw the article in the 	<i>Glasgow Herald.</i> I awoke one morning to find my photograph on the front page. One often works hard to get into the press by issuing press releases but achieves nothing, so I was surprised to see my photograph on the front page.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman should withdraw his allegation. My argument is simple: my intention to table an opting-out amendment to the Bill was public knowledge long before that letter; the 	<i>Hansard</i> report of at least two Scottish Question Times before the letter shows that that was my intention. All I ask is that the hon. Member for Dumbarton withdraw his allegation that I took part in any conspiracy. My intention to table the amendment was public knowledge; it appeard in 	<i>Hansard</i> months before the 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> article appeared.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The main aspect of the contribution of the hon. Member for Eastwood is that he says that I mentioned a conspiracy. I never mentioned that word. I repeat that I take the 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> story as gospel because I have looked at that paper every day since 30 March and have seen no refutation of the fact that the letter came from the Prime Minister's office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully. My understanding is that the hon. Gentleman now accepts that the Prime Minister's letter made obvious reference to what 	<i>Hansard</i> and public reports had already made clear—that my hon. Friend proposed to table an amendment. The letter referred only to that. What is in the public domain is public knowledge. The hon. Gentleman correct me if I am wrong, but does he now accept that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that he followed the argument, but he has not. I read a quote from the Prime Minster's letter and it said that her Secretary of State—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Members for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) and for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) should not conduct conversations on their feet while another hon. Member is speaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can finish the debate because the amendment tabled this morning is physical proof of the accuracy of the letter in the 	<i>Glasgow Herald.</i> That was the thrust of my case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apparently the hon. Member for Eastwood has been cast in the time-honoured role of the straight man. He is the Oliver Hardy in this comedy to the Secretary of State's Stan Laurel. It was always Stan
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0830">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>141</span>
Laurel's fate to be accident-prone, confused, not fully aware of what was going on, to be surrounded by chaos and to get everyone else into a real pickle. When the hon. Member for Eastwood discovered that the script for the farce had been made pubic, he must have felt like saying to the Secretary of State—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. When the Chairman rises to speak the hon. Member must sit down immediately and shup up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make one point clear. The hon. Member has no right to imply anything about the motives of the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart). It is all right to make other remarks, but he must be careful not to question the hon. Member's integrity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you Mr. Knox. I am not questioning the hon. Gentleman's integrity, but comparing it with the Oliver Hardy and Stan Laurel farce in which Stan says, "This is another fine mess that you've got me into." I suggest that in this case the Secretary of State can only stand and scratch his head.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State issued a statement on 31 March in response to the 	<i>Glasgow Herald.</i> On Second Reading, my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) quoted the statement, in which the Secretary of State said:
	<br><q><p>"The curremt position is that the Scottish Education Department, at my request, is considering what would be required if such a provision was to be considered appropriate in a future Bill. Whether such a provision will be made will be determined in the light of such evidence as may be forthcoming of and interest in a right of opting-out amongst Sccottish parents and others with an interest in education.".—[	<i>Official Report,,</i> 12 April 1988; Vol. 131, c.45.]</p></q>
Would that the Government were so forward thinking and solicitous in every aspect of Government policy. They have ignored the manifest expression of people's will until now. Therefore the suspicion must be that the Government have a hard and fast determination to imagine a demand where none exists. The ability of the Government to turn their face from reality was minifestly evident during the period of consultation on their document "School Management and the Role of Parents".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Eastwood was in his constituency in November and had a meeting of 120 parents. The Government's document was the basis of the discussion and it is my information that more than 100 parents were against the document's proposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The meeting to which the hon. Gentleman refers was at Eastwood high school. There was massive opposition to the ceiling powers—I do not deny that. I made clear to the meeting the precise point that I made today—opting-out is, in principle, a different matter from the question of school boards. It is wholly inaccurate to suggest that the meeting was somehow against opting-out. The question of opting-out was not raised at that meeting, which was part of the consultation process on school boards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that I should call on the words of the right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>142</span>
(Mr. Buchanan-Smith), who said that the opting-out proposals came out of the blue. He was right to say that they strike fundamentally at the heart of public school system in Scotland. Parents, including those at the Eastwood meeting, are against such measures because of their implications for Scottish education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I examined the 7,500 responses to the document in the Library. Parents clearly said that although they wanted to be involved in a partnership with teachers in running schools they strongly opposed having an executive or management role. That message came over loud and clear. They stated unequivocally that they trusted teachers, but that they did not trust other parents to have responsibility for their children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parents believed that the consultative paper proposed a costly and simplistic approach to a complex problem and were suspicious that the consultation was a sham. That feeling came across in a public meeting in my constituency attended by 200 parents and members of the public. They suspected that the Secretary of State intended to go ahead with a predetermined programme. The Bill incorporates the proposals of the consultative document, albeit in camouflage. The Government clearly do not intend to be deflected from achieving their ideological goals by incovenient reality or recalcitrant parents who hold opinions with which they do not agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am puzzled by the hon. Gentleman's argument. He appears to be criticising the proposals on school boards. What has that to do with opting out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Opting out is a fundamental part of the proposals for school boards. Many questions arise from the Secretary of State's statement of 31 March about the anticipated interest in opting out. Who are the
	<br><q><p>"others with an interest in education"</p></q>
to whom he refers? Will the Government launch another consultative exercise to determine the interest of Scottish parents in opting out? That would seem pointless and futile because they will already have the answer. What evidence of interest in opting out will the Government accept—1,000, 100, or 10 parents in favour? What will the Government regard as evidence and, more importantly, how will that evidence be assessed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We already have evidence of one conspiracy issue, but I fear that another may come to light. Perhaps we are witnessing it today as we discover that new clause 1 is to be rejected by the Secretary of State, who can then say that we were told on Second Reading that the Bill had nothing to do with preparing the ground for opting out. Perhaps, to our astonishment, we shall be told in a few months' time that hitherto undetected evidence for opting out has been discovered and that there will be no delay in implementing the programme because civil servants had been working on it and drawing up detailed plans for months, just in case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If no such demand is discovered, the Government may leave themselves open to the charge of having committed the most heinous crime in the Tory hierarchy of crime—wasting resources. One will then
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0831">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>143</span>
be justified in asking how many civil servants were employed in the exercise, what the cost was and, more pertinently, exactly what the civil servants were doing. We need answers to those questions. The Government's subterfuge over this exercise today makes the need for answers all the more urgent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside said in his accurate assessment, it is clear that there is no demand for opting out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there is no demand, why have I received 3,000 letters in support of opting out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman put those letters in the Library, we could perhaps understand that. I shall develop the point about no demand. The hon. Gentleman asked why we fear school boards if there is no demand? I do not doubt that the Government will try to invent a demand to justify the introduction of opting out. Once they have introduced it, they will help to created a demand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making a strong plea in saying that there is no demand for opting-out. How would he measure demand for opting-out, and which tests would he apply?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a question for the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that question bounces back. I have already asked it and I should like the Minister to answer it when he replies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once the Government have introduced opting-out, they will help to create a demand because their antagonism towards state education—the neglect and the determination to undermine it—will lead some parents to believe that they can secure a better deal for their children if they fall in with the Government's plan. One can hardly fault the logic of that. Those parents who choose, albeit reluctantly, to opt-out will tend to be the more affluent ones—those with skills, confidence and time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for interrupting the hon. Gentleman, but he has thrown the question about demand back at me, and I shall try to deal with it. But is he arguing that groups of parents wanting to opt-out would not constitute a test that would indicate demand, and that demand would be acknowledged only if the educationists and the education authorities were to support it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. My feeling, and that of my hon. Friends and of parents, is that so far there is no demand. However, by proceeding with their proposals the Government can manufacture a demand. That is my point, and that is why I am worried about the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once parents are aware that the state is no longer interested in providing decent standards of education for all children, regardless of social background, status, ability and income of the parents, many of them may try to protect their children as best they can. They will not be doing it purely for selfish
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>144</span>
reasons, because they believe in the survival of the fittest, nor because they lack a social conscience. They will be doing it least of all because they believe that opting-out is the most effective basis for the provision of education. It will be because they recognise that the Government are in the business of creating inequality and of allocating success and failure. They will fear that if they do not play the game according to the Government's rules, their children will be disadvantaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The net effect of opting-out will be the creation of magnet schools, which will tend to be the better resourced schools with the fewest problems. The rest will become sink schools, whose problems will multiply as time goes on. What future is there for the magnet schools, such as the Lenzie academy and the Harris academy, which have already been mentioned, where the quality of education is rapidly deteriorating as a consequence of the burgeoning of school rolls? The success of such schools will be short lived and the result will be chaos.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This century, education has made slow, painful progress towards providing a more egalitarian system that offers hope and opportunity to all children. That has always been a concern of the Labour movement, and Conservatives such as Rab Butler have also played an honourable role in the process. The battle for a truly comprehensive education system was hard won. Despite the Government's efforts to discredit it, it has been an outstanding success by any standard.

We are now in a political timewarp with a Government who want to return to Victorian standards of education, in which the interests of the privileged minority take precedence over the majority. We are now engaged in battles that were fought and won yesteryear. Those battles established a right to equal access to education for all children. All the evidence from the Government's so-called consultative process has reassured me that it is not a battle which the Opposition will fight alone. We have the overwhelming support of Scottish parents on this issue, something which the Government would be well advised to take into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to intervene at this stage. As my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) will be unable to be here at our next sitting, I thought it appropriate to respond to some of his arguments now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I begin by congratulating the Labour party on its latest policy statement, "Parents in Partnership", which was published the other day. It contains a number of interesting ideas which we shall consider in the context of the Bill. What a pity that in today's press the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) is quoted as rejecting the package, saying that it was launched by Jack Straw, a shadow Minister for the Department of Education and Science, and that the proposals did not apply to Scotland. He said that Scottish Opposition Members would look at the new document but that there was no intention at present to change their position.

That statement sums up the position of Scottish Opposition Members. They are against any change. They have become the mammoths of Scottish politics and reject any new idea, whatever it is worth. I congratulate my hon. Friend on tabling the new clause and giving us the opportunity to consider the advantages, or otherwise, for parents in Scotland of opting-out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Labour party made its position clear on parental involvement in Scottish education when the Minister published his original proposals. We submitted to his office our response which set out our response to his paper and how we saw the future development of parental involvement. We shall hear more of that as our debates unfold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document to which he has referred does not apply to Scotland because Scottish education, as the Minister well knows, is devolved. We shall, of course, study the document, but at present our policy is as stated in response to the Minister's proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. No doubt he will have a word with the EIS which is quoted as saying:
	<br><q><p>"Teachers and parents are becoming increasingly fed up with politicians who seem to want to use education as a political football. It is bad enough that we have to battle against Conservative party dogma in the School Boards Bill without being presented with a set of pious and half-baked ideas from the Labour party."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must understand that the EIS is not being presented with such a package either by me or by the Labour party in Scotland.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before he dashes off to Strasbourg, the hon. Member for Eastwood should know that we have made clear our policy on parental involvement in Scottish education. The Scottish council of the Labour party submitted a document to the Minister that set out our policy. That is what we stand by, and that is what we shall debate in the context of the Bill's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat that the document to which the Minister referred does not apply to Scotland. Of course we want to consider its proposals. We shall come back to it because our policy is flexible and can be adapted from time to time as the need arises. I should have thought that the Minister would have understood that. His attempt to score some points by referring to a document which is not before the Committee is not helping us to make headway.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I merely wanted to inform the hon. Gentleman that the document contains a number of good ideas which, I freely confess, I had not thought of myself, and which we shall seek to engage as part of our policy of extending parental choice and involvement in the education process. I am sorry that Opposition Members who represent Scottish constituencies are not prepared to embrace.

The hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall)—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) must not make derogatory remarks about the Chairman from a sedentary position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is related to what we are discussing in the sense that my hon. Friend—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Knox. First, is it in order for the Minister to respond to a debate before others have had the opportunity to address the Committee? That is unusual. Secondly, is it in order for him to wast our time by referring to matters which are not before the Committee? Surely neither of those things is in order. We let the Minister respond. We decided that that was fair enough, as the hon. Member for Eastwood apparently has different priorities from the rest of us and intends to be dilatory in his duties to this Committee, choosing instead to go off on a freebie to Strasbourg.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsythe (Mr. Hogg) raised a point of order, but nothing that he has said so far is a point of order. He knows perfectly well that the Chair called the Minister to speak and that that is within the discretion of the Chair. In Committee proceedings, as the hon. Gentleman knows, people can speak on more than one occasion and I have no doubt that the Minister will wish to speak again later. In this case, he made a special request to me to be called this morning to deal with the points raised by his hon. Friend. I thought, therefore, that it was not unreasonable to call him to speak at that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the second point raised by the hon. Gentleman, he knows perfectly well that I had just ruled that the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), was out of order. If I may say so, he was encouraged to go even further out of order by some other hon. Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To make progress, I shall leave the sensitive area of the Labour party's policy on parents' involvement in schools. The hon. Member for Dumbarton regaled us with his Laurel and Hardy analogies. The policies that we are hearing from Opposition Members appear to be of that vintage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was struck by what the hon. Member for Dumbarton said about magnet schools. When my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood introduced his
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0833">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>147</span>
new clause, he argued that there were schools in his constituency and in Strathclyde that had become magnet schools because of the type of education that they offered. They may offer single-sex education or a quality of academic achievement or the opportunity for overlap curricular activities such as music, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, the hon. Member for Glasgow, Springburn (Mr. Martin) said that the way to deal with magnet schools was not to put padlocks on the gates. My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood said that the regulations which have been laid may offer an appeal to the Secretary of State for some magnet schools which are faced with a closure proposal. My hon. Friend mentioned Our Lady and St. Francis. I confirm that I have not only visited that school but have seen its academic record. Its catchment area is by no means middle class—quite the contrary—but it has been singular in achieving considerable academic success. Indeed, it is one of the few schools in Glasgow which has bucked the trend in recent years by improving its standards. My hon. Friend argued that because a group of councillors—not, incidentally, supported by councillor Green, as he the hon. Gentleman suggested—decide that single-sex education is a bad thing, the parents are faced with having to lose choice and opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) said that there was no demand for opting-out and that it was not required in other parts of Scotland. We must face the challenge that my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood put before the Committee. Some parents—my right honourable Friend and I are among them—are able to exercise choice, to opt-out and to choose schools that offer specialist facilities, whether they be single-sex education or whatever. They are able to exercise that choice because they have money in their bank accounts. My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood was arguing that that choice should be available to people in the state sector who cannot afford to pay twice. Our concern, in extending and preserving choice, should be with the vast majority of parents within the state system. The Education Reform Bill contains provisions for opting-out to provide those parents with that opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to take the Minister back to what I thought I heard him say. He praised one school as being one of the few in recent years to have bucked the trend and improved standards? Is that correct? On what evidence does he base that statement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I base it on the survey, which I referred to in the Scottish Grand Committee debate, carried out by Glasgow's divisional education officer of the performance of schools in Strathclyde, which the Strathclyde education authority has refused to publish. It clearly shows that some schools have experienced a decline in the number of examination passes while others have improved their position. It shows that there is a clear correlation between schools to which parents choose to send their children under the parents' charter, which was provided by the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>148</span>
Government, and schools that are performing well academically. We are not talking only about schools, as the Opposition will doubtless seek to argue, which have a favourable demographic catchment area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know how many other members of the Committee have taught in secondary schools, but I taught in a comprehensive for many years and I studied educational research as part of my in-service training. It is clear that examination performance correlates directly to a school's intake. The Minister says that there is evidence that some schools have had worse examination results in recent years than others, but that is precisely because of the parents' charter. Children from a particular type of background are going to schools and improving the examination performance of them, while the results of the schools that are left behind—the sink schools—which do not have the same number of children from that kind of background tend to tail off. It is a direct result of the Minister's interference in the comprehensive system that examination results of Scottish schools are suffering.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman jumps to conclusions, perhaps he might prevail on the director of education in Strathclyde to release that survey to him. It is not completely comprehensive in terms of its methodology and it has been described by the director of education as flawed but I am advised that while it is crude it certainly is not flawed. It is perfectly proper for me to draw the conclusions I have drawn from it. If the hon. Gentleman is concerned about education in Strathclyde he should look at that survey before reaching conclusions. Moreover, I understand that information about each school was made available to the schools concerned at a conference last year, although the complete picture has not been published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) advanced a curious argument against the new clause. He argued that no one was interested, but then realised that there was a problem in that argument. He refused to define a proper basis by which to assess demand because he did not want to be put into the position of arguing that if parents in particular schools wished to opt-out that would constitute demand. His notion of demand is that the educational establishment as a whole should approve. That is an extremely broad test. He argued that somehow or other demand would be created artificially by the Government and that if people thought that the state was no longer interested in education they would opt-out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Grant-maintained schools in England—opted-out schools—are state schools. There is no question of fee paying or changing the character of the schools; they are state schools but they are not controlled by the local authority. They represent an opportunity for diversity and variety within the sytem.

As my hon. Friend pointed out, that is an anathema to councillors in Strathclyde, from whom councillor

Green dissociated himself. They believe that they should decide whether single-sex education is right and proper or whether it is anachronistic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is their right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Members believe in parental choice, which should not be limited because parents cannot afford any option other than the state sector. Given that that includes the vast majority of parents, the state sector has an obligation to provide that choice and variety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a grant-maintained school in England has more applicants than places, how does it decide who will enter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. When the Minister resumes, will he address his remarks to the Chair rather than to the back of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Knox.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked how we assess demand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the same question. The hon. Gentleman asked about schools that are over-subscribed. We are ahead of the English in extending parental choice—it is included in the Education Reform Bill—because parents are able to choose schools under our parents' charter and it is impossible for the local authority to restrict that choice by implementing artificial limits on capacity. That Bill introduces that provision for the first time in England, but we have enjoyed it since 1981.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is that there is no distinction in principle between the difficulties of demand and capacity faced by schools that have opted-out or schools, such as Paisley grammar and others mentioned by my hon. Friend, where parents are falling over themselves to use their rights granted by the Government under the parents' charter. The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) supports Strathclyde council's view that the solution is to close schools faced with parental demand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Knox. I am becoming increasingly impatient because I am wondering whether I am listening to a ministerial or a Back Bench intervention. What about the rest of Scotland? Is this not a Scottish Committee? Ministers and Back Benchers with legitimate interests have become obsessed with Strathclyde.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member knows perfectly well that that is not a matter for the Chair. Fortunately, the Chair has no responsibility for the content of any of the speeches, provided that they are in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>150</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Knox. The Minister has been speaking for 10 or 15 minutes. The hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) said that he would not press the amendment to a Division. The Minister is enthusing over this amendment, which is not to be pressed to a Division. I am not clear whether that is in order. Is the Minister not supposed to say that he agrees with the hon. Gentleman in not pressing the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that that is not a matter for the Chair. The content of the Minister's speech is entirely his responsibility, as the content of the hon. Gentleman's speeches is the hon. Gentleman's responsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to give way to the hon. Gentleman if he wishes to intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I am endeavouring to answer some of the arguments advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You agreed with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with many of his arguments and I shall say something about amendment No. 10. It is important that I respond to the points that he made so that members of the Committee are aware of the Government's thinking on the relationship between the Bill and the new clause. The hon. Member for Dumbarton raised a number of issues and I have sought to deal with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My Friend the Member for Eastwood said that he has had 2,900 letters urging him to persuade the Government to provide for opting-out in Scotland. I pressed Opposition Members to say what they believed to be a reasonable level of demand. Only today I received a letter from a parent in Paisley urging us to allow for opting-out in Scotland—
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[	<i>Interruption.</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before Members laugh too loudly, the parent had children at Stanely Green, not at Paisley grammar. I disagree with my hon. Friend in his trenchant criticism of the Government's decision on opting-out. He agreed with an Opposition Member that the Secretary of State's position and my own were not consistent. In fact, our positions are consistent. He is right to argue—and I agreed with him about this on Second Reading—that school boards are about creating opportunities for parental involvement in the education system. That is why I referred to the Labour party document that is entitled "Parents in Partnership". Parental involvement is part of the thrust of our policy, and we shall carry the flag for all the parties in Scotland on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opting-out is about extending choice. That is why I took time to—the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth said "enthuse", but that is his interpretation—spell out the importance to the Government of choice within education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0835">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>151</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How will a school that has opted-out choose which children to admit when more parents want their children to go there than there are places for them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggest that the hon. Gentleman has a word with Strathclyde education authority, which has a number of schools for which parental demand is significant. For example, the case of Paisley grammar will come to the Secretary of State because on the region's own assessment demand has exceeded capacity. Paisley grammar school is a good example of a school in that position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not allow remarks from a sedentary position. Mr. McWilliam had some trouble with that earlier this week. I should be grateful if hon. Members would allow the hon. Member on his feet to speak without interruption.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give way to my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it would be useful if the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie asked the managers of Jordanhill school, which has opted-out, how they select pupils? Does he agree that it is significant that the hon. Member for Dumbarton did not even try to address the key argument about Our Lady and St. Francis school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it is significant. My hon. Friend said that he thought that the Catholic church would not intervene. It seems that Our Lady and St. Francis school will close unless it can be argued that the capacity of the school and its relationship to the law make it fall within regulations. It is significant that the hon. Gentleman did not address himself to that argument. However, to be fair, councillor Green addressed that issue in the radio programme from which that my hon. Friend quoted, and made it clear that his council's view of democracy is that a Committee decides what is good for the people and the people take what they think should be granted to them. I am sure that people who so think will enjoy putting that view to the people in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the Minister accepts that education authorities have a statutory duty to consider the best format for the provision of education, which is what councillor Green and his Committee have done. Their conclusion was as he stated. It is unfair of the Minister to make these attacks on Strathclyde regional council and on councillor Green when he was simply carrying out the awesome responsbility placed on him and the education authority by the statute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should do his homework. Councillor Green was attacking the education Committee on that programme, for having taken that decision, and was saying that it was wrong. My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood pointed out that for many ethnic minorities—Moslems and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>152</span>
others—in Glasgow, Our Lady and St. Francis offers the opportunity for single-sex education. I heard councillor Green asking how it was consistent for a local authority such as Strathclyde to have an equal opportunities policy, but be party to decisions to close down schools on the basis that they represent one particular ethic of education of which it disapproves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood said, it does not make sense to close popular schools that are full—where the costs per pupil are lower—and to keep open those that do not have parental demand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To answer the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), I did not refer to particular schools. I was considering Scottish education, supporting the comments made by the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith), and considering the general consequences for Scottish education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned Jordanhill college and its governors. The hon. Member for Eastwood and the Minister should ask the head teacher and other teachers at that college what they think of Strathclyde regional council and its involvement in the school. Its advisers give support to the college and validate the standard-grade courses. Therefore, the hon. Gentleman's example of an opted-out school could not do without the lifeblood of the local education authority for facilities. It is not opting-out and it depends very much on the local education authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has dug a large hole for himself. Is he arguing that Jordanhill operates satisfactorily alongside Strathclyde? My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood has been arguing for the opportunity for schools to be centrally-funded as opted-out schools, so the hon. Gentleman seems to be on the same side of the argument as my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman brags about what the Strathclyde LEA has done for Jordanhill. I was a Back Bencher at the time so I do not know the details, but I recall that the question of Jordanhill opting-out and being funded as a grant-maintained school arose only because the Strathclyde authority refused to take the school into its care. Some of the reasons for that refusal are similar to the justifications that are being advanced for an attack on other magnet schools. If the hon. Member for Dumbarton is really saying that it is possible for all the services of the education authority to be provided for a school such as Jordanhill, he has gone a long way toward agreeing with my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood was right in anticipating that there were 140 technical deficiencies in the new clause. I shall not detain the Committee by detailing them all—let us take them as read. I acknowledge that he has tabled the new clause to give us an opportunity to discuss these issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0836">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>153</span>
said that the schools interested in opting-out would be only those where there is discontent. Therefore, it would not be an appropriate policy, because it would upset the structure and cause difficulties. It is an interesting argument and it is correct. Parents would not wish to opt-out unless they saw an opportunity that was not available within their education authority. The hon. Gentleman's observation about that is correct, but he should ask himself whether he is making the right decision in taking that view. Is it appropriate that a uniformity or greyness is allowed and that there is no opportunity for diversity within the state system? That is the argument that is advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth and for Dumbarton argued that there was no demand for opting-out and that it would have terrible consequences. My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood was right to say that it is not possible to have one's cake and eat it. It is not possible to accept that opting-out would be immensely damaging to the Scottish education system and at the same time to argue that no one would wish to opt-out. It could be immensely damaging only in the terms of Labour Members. I do not accept their stance. Opting-out could be damaging only if schools chose to take advantage of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Listening to the hon. Member for Dumbarton and other Members, I felt that the fear among the Opposition is that if they unleashed choice to the parents, the parents would vote with their feet about some of the decisions taken by education authorities. I do not know whether that fear is justified, but it is not consistent with the argument that there is no demand within the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood said that single-sex schools were being destroyed by a political decision, the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) said, from a sedentary position, "That is democracy." The type of democracy that my hon. Friend means and which is contained in the Bill is a devolution of power to local level so that small groups do not make decisions that have binding consequences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister confuses choice and coercion. I should like to pose a simple question—why does he despise Scottish local education authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have considerable admiration for Scottish education authorities and much of what they have done. Why does the Gentleman have so little confidence in them that he is terrified at the prospect of parents having choice through the type of new clause that my hon. Friend proposed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Knox. I accept that the Minister is indulging in a bit of licence but surely he cannot respond to questions by talking about concepts that we have not mentioned. I talked about democracy, not about being frightened by the implications of it. It is unworthy of the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>154</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not a point of order, and the hon. Gentleman knows that perfectly well. I do not have responsibility for what the Minister does or does not say and, fortunately, I do not have responsibility for what the hon. Gentleman says.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given the nature of the hon. Gentleman's intervention, it is a little rich for him to complain about me putting words into his mouth. However, I turn now to the serious point that the hon. Gentleman made about democracy—
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[	<i>Interruption.</i>]

I know that that is painful for the Opposition, but they should face the consequences of the education policy with which they are saddled. It has serious implications for people throughout Scotland, including many of their own supporters.

Democracy is a funny plant. I have been reading my correspondence—my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood has mentioned the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galloway), and I shall not name others for fear of embarrassing them—and I find that I am receiving letters from Labour Members representing Scottish constituencies in which they urge me to use the regulations that allow my right honourable and learned Friend the Secretary of State to prevent closure and save schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Name them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Members for Hillhead and for Glasgow, Springburn (Mr. Martin). They urge me to use the regulations—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that all?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is an interesting manifestation of democracy that neither of those hon. Gentlemen supported the regulations yet they are now writing to me asking me to persuade my right honourble and learned Friend the Secretary of State to use the powers provided in the regulations to save schools which are being closed by an authority which is controlled by the party to which they subscribe and of which they are members. That is an interesting example of democracy. That may make the point to the hon. Member for Fife, Central that small groups who are members of committees such as the Strathclyde education committee are not always able to anticipate the wide variety of circumstances in individual schools. My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood is trying to provide for plurality, diversity and opportunity and Opposition Members are seeking to resist it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend talked about Paisley grammar school. He will understand if I do not say much about it because of the regulations to which I have just referred. I noted that the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) made a comment from a sedentary position while my hon. Friend was arguing for opting-out and for his new clause. I hope that my hon. Friend was wrong when he used the terrifying argument that should my right honourable and

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>155</span>
learned Friend the Secretary of State seek to intervene and prevent closure, the Strathclyde authority might be inclined to put in place a headmaster who would be unsympathetic to the ethos of that school. He said that the parents were worried about that and that that is why they want to be able to opt-out. I thought that that was terrifying and I expected Opposition Members to jump up and say, "Nonsense." But the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy said, from a sedentary position, "I expect that's more than likely."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I said was that as there would be a difference of a generation and a half to two generations, it was more than likely. It is a difficult concept for someone as ignorant as the Minister, but it is quite different from the one that he had in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am bound to say that the bit about the generations must have been said so quietly that I did not hear it, but I accept what the hon. Gentleman said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should withdraw his statement Mr. Knox, because I can confirm exactly what my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) said. The Minister's aspersion is wholly inaccurate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a matter for the Chairman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the 	<i>Official Report</i> records sendentary interventions, but we can examine that later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Withdraw.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is saying that he does not think that that is more than likely, I am happy to acknowledge that, but I noticed that no Opposition Member took issue with my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood in that extremely serious assertion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend said that one of the fears of parents about Paisley grammar and other schools that might be saved from closure is that the education authority, out of pique or spite, might seek to disadvantage those schools. He advanced that argument in the context of the Government's policy to include a new clause along the lines that he proposed. No Opposition Member jumped up to argue to the contrary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, Central asked me to pay tribute to education authorities. If I were running Strathclyde and believed that many parents thought that my authority was capable of such conduct, I should be very alarmed and would seek to do something about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Under-Secretary will be present on Tuesday to listen to rational comments about the future of the comprehensive system and why opting-out is such a bad deal for Scottish schools, rather than indulging in this picking-off of people in a pathetic ministerial response to an extreme proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>156</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is welcome to make judgments about my responses, but I am trying to deal with the arguments. None of the contributions from Opposition Members advanced a single argument. For the hon. Gentleman to criticise me for responding to the substance of the argument, as opposed to indulging in the Laurel and Hardy pyrotechnics and personal attacks that we had from the hon. Member for Dumbarton, is treading on very thin ice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have looked at all the arguments and it will come as no surprise to my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood to learn that I should appreciate his withdrawing the amendment because I am not inclined to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall explain. There is plenty of time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend deal with this important point before he sits down? I understand opting-out, but will he say what its consequences will be for the present structure of education in Scotland? We should know his views on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right honourable Friend is mistaken if he thinks that I am about to sit down. He is also mistaken in the interpretation that he has put on my remarks. I am enthusing not about opting-out but the extension of choice to parents. I am being critical of Labour politics in Strathclyde, which seek to frustrate opportunities for parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been responding to the arguments put by my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart). I am not prepared to accept opting-out in the Bill. The establishment of school boards, which is what the Bill is about, is desirable development. It is part of a policy of extending parents in partnership or partnership for parents, of which even the Labour party in the south has recognised the merits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Irrespective of whether we introduce the legislation that my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood desires, what we seek to achieve in the Bill stands in its own right. As my hon. Friend pointed out, it stands as an opportunity for parents to become involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Maclean (Penrith and The Border)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Knox. I give notice to the Committee that on Tuesday next I shall move a motion,
	<br><q><p>"That during further proceedings on the School Boards (Scotland) Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock, with the exception of Thursday 12 May."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be helpful to the Committee to know that if that sittings motion is accepted on Tuesday morning the Committee will sit on Tuesday afternoon. If it is not accepted, the Committee cannot sit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
