	<p>	<i>Amendment moved [10 May]:</i> No. 87, in page 3, line 39, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"may complete their term of office"</p></blockquote>

	<br><blockquote><p>"will demit office immediately".—[	<i>Mr. Norman Hogg</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cumbernauld and Kilsyth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious that there should not be a repeat of what happened last week. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that individuals who cease to be eligible leave the board immediately and do not, as the Bill suggests,
	<br><blockquote><p>"complete their term of office".</p></blockquote>
I am not clear whether the Government intend school boards to be informal or statutory bodies. If they are to be statutory bodies with a formal approach to all that they do, there is a strong case for being strict about the membership of a board. If a member becomes ineligible to serve three months after an election, he should not continue to serve on the board. Several of my hon. Friends may wish to emphasise that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister clarify the position with regard to persons who are ineligible for election but who were elected earlier when they were eligible? What will happen during that person's remaining period of elected service?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) has asked me to clarify Government thinking behind the provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot accept his amendment, although I understand his reason for moving it. During consultation, anxiety was expressed about lack of continuity of experience on school borads. The Bill deals with that possibility by allowing those elected as parent members to continue in office for their full term after their children have left school. The effect of the amendment would be to require such parents to demit office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Bill stands it is conceivable that parents may have to serve a substantial part of their term of office while they have no child at the school, but it is unlikely that parents would elect a candidate whose
	<span class='label label-info column'>334</span>
child was in its final year at school unless he or she had a particular quality to offer. That is why we should not seek to impose a limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, I question the wisdom of the view that simply because a parent no longer has a child at that school he or she has nothing to contribute to the school board's deliberations. The parent may continue to have an interest in the school and bring objectivity to its deliberations. The notes on clauses make it clear that if a parent no longer has an interest, we expect him or her to resign in the normal way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we accepted the amendment, more elections would take place. I know that the hon. Gentleman is worried about the cost of school boards; administration and bureaucracy are also matters to which he has drawn the Committee's attention. Therefore, I am sure that I shall have no trouble in enlisting his support to withdraw this amendment, which would clearly add to bureaucracy and to general difficulties. Our aim is to provide the continuity and experience, a consideration that led us to increase the term of office from three to four years. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Worthington 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clydebank and Milngavie)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not intend to speak until I heard the Minister's explanation. It is extraordinary that we should set up an elected body on which people no longer qualified to be elected as members should be able to sit. The equivalent would be if a Member of Parliament emigrated, and continued to be a Member though no longer in the country. I do not suppose that any hon. Member has any such intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolmn Bruce 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gordon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Stonehouse did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That someone should continue as a member of a board though no longer qualified to do so is a strange proposition. The same applies to any voluntary organisation, such as a golf or tennis club. I do not believe that someone who has left such a club should continue to serve on a board to which they had been elected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is on tenuous ground. If he thinks that there will be an overwhelming demand to go on the boards, only those qualified for membership as a parent should be able to serve on them. At other times the Minister has been sceptical about the principle of people with objectiveity sitting on the boards. The Bill does not allow outsiders to be members nor has it sought to establish community membership or to allow, as of right, the locally elected council member for the area to sit on the boards. It seems strange that a person who has a child remaining at the school for only a short time may continue to have a place, as of right, on a board. If a person is no longer qualified to stand he should resign and be replaced by someone who is eligible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first point made by the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) was that it was hard to understand how we can allow parents no longer eligible for election to continue on the board. It is possible that a parent
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0936">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>335</span>
may have a younger child who is about to start school so the parent may be about to have the right to sit on the board again. Yet, according to the amendment, they would be required to leave the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am slightly astonished to hear the hon. Gentleman say that people should not be allowed to remain in office after election in such cases, and after satisfying the terms for eligibility for election because such a procedure has applied for years in local government. People can be elected as councillors, then no longer satisfy the requirements in terms of residence in the local authority area, but still continue as councillors. There are many examples of that. Indeed, the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) reminded us of a case of a Member of Parliament who emigrated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is incorrect for the hon. Gentleman for Clydebank and Milngavie to say that I have been sceptical about the contribution which outsiders can make to the provision of school boards because we have rejected his case for community members. Far from being sceptical, we have made particular provision for co-option and we have left the boards with the freedom to co-opt people they consider to be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, neither of these two points are soundly based. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept the wisdom of the provisions of the Bill as drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Lewis Moonie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kirkcaldy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the Minister, in common with me, has received the communication from the Law Society of Scotland. It raises specific objections to parents being allowed to continue for the remainder of a term of office. Will the Minister comment on its suggestion that clause 3(6) should be amended by adding the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"provided that their remaining term of office is less than two years"</p></blockquote>
That might be a reasonable compromise for the Minister to consider before the Bill reaches Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to comment on that although I believe that I covered the point in my earlier remarks. As far as possible, we wish to avoid elections, but if we were to accept the Law Society's suggestion, it would add to the number. The Government believe that there is merit in allowing people to serve their full term and leaving it to the electors—the parents—to decide whether to elect a candidate who will serve for more than two years while no longer a parent at the school. Provisions elsewhere in the Bill, to which I was happy to accept the hon. Gentlemen's amendment and increase to 250 words, will give people ample opportunity to explain their children's age and their relationship to the school. We should leave the decision to the judgment of individuals in particular schools rather than accept the type of prescription that the Law Society of Scotland and others have suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not persuaded by any of the Minister's arguments. However, I shall not press the amendment. The fact that the same circumstances
	<span class='label label-info column'>336</span>
arise in local government is no recommendation. In my constituency of Cumbernauld and Kilsyth we had to put up with the presence of Mr. Gordon Murray even after he had moved out of the town. He hailed his return to Cumbernauld as an issue of great importance to the people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: His second coming.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to say that it did not work and his political career came to an abrupt halt at 7.30 pm yesterday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gordon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The cards fell the wrong way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not prepared to lend the Minister our pack of cards, although I know that he might want the particular pack of cards that we use.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are marked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Last week I gave notice to the Minister that I should rise at this point in the debate. I have not tabled an amendment on the subject as I recognise how difficult it is to frame an appropriate one. Clause 3(4) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A School Board may remove any member of the Board who they are satisfied … is unable to carry out his duties by reason of physical or mental illness or incapacity".</p></blockquote>
I appreciate that it would be easy to define if someone was rendered incapable of carrying out his duties by reason of physical incapacity. The position in law on mental illness or incapacity however is less clear. There is an indefinite range of degrees of disability which, in the eyes of some members of the Committee, might take one of their fellows unfit to remain a member, particularly if he propounded views with which they disagreed. The dividing line between a personality disorder that is not formally recognised as a mental illness and a mental illness that has many of the same characteristics is uncertain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a former psychiatrist, I feel that the Minister should accept that considerable changes to the clause are necessary to make it acceptable to the medical and legal professions in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, I cite the document from the Law Society of Scotland, which suggests that an appropriate safeguard might be to amend the clause so that, instead of the boards having power to remove someone by reason of mental incapacity or illness, they must apply to the Secretary of State for the removal of that person. If the Bill is enacted, I look to the regulations to define the procedure more accurately, and that Law Society proposal would at least build in a safeguard. I want to hear the Minister's views before deciding on the course of action to take.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0937">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>337</span>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Kircaldy (Dr Moonie) kindly gave me notice of his anxieties about this matter, and I have considered them carefully. The clause provides for a board to remove a member if it is satisfied that the member is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"unable to carry out his duties by reason of physical or mental illness or incapacity".</p></blockquote>
I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's remarks—it is a stiff test, but so it should be. The hon. Gentleman said that it could be difficult if the member involved had merely disagreed with other board members. Occasionally, when I have disagreed with the Labour Party, or taken a view that it thought extraordinary, it has suggested that I might meet the conditions of the test.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Kircaldy (Dr Moonie) is a psychiatrist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He may be a psychiatrist, but he is among those who have made such suggestions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be highly undesirable if the test were anything other than stringent. We do not want the provisions to enable boards to get rid of members whose views are merely unconventional or troublesome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We considered alternative tests, but the test in the Bill is not only strict, but known in law and widely applied in similar circumstances. Introducing a new test would provide an uncertain definition that could almost certainly be established only through court proceedings and clarification of the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is to be left to a school board to make such a decision will the Minister explain what tests and professional advice will be available to enable it to make a properly informed decision? Could such decisions be challenged in the courts? That might lead to more problems than the Minister has anticipated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the purpose of the clause, but there are many illnesses that would not incapacitate a person permanently from serving on a school board, for example, manic depression, which occurs in cyclical bouts. However, during a period of two months or so in which the illness occurs, it could produce such an incapacity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must rely on the local knowledge and judgment of the board involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, come on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may say, "Oh, come on", but removing a member from a board is a serious matter. The boards would have to be satisfied that, if they used that power, their decisions could not be challenged successfully under judicial review. If the mental illness or incapacity test is to be applied, the boards must have satisfied that the member involved is incapable of acting in a legal sense. The test cannot be applied simply because someone is being difficult or eccentric. Preventing such circumstances arising is a matter for those who vote in the election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>338</span>
If something happens during the course of a tenure of office, the best way to proceed is for members of the board to prevail on the individual concerned to resign his post. As Opposition Members know, there are various ways of achieving that objective. But it would be wrong to provide a new or weaker test, which would create uncertainty especially if it opened up the opportunity for people to remove members form boards for reasons other than those covered by this rigorous test. I think that there will be few, if any, such cases, although I acknowledge that the Committee must anticipate every eventuality. The test applies generally in respect of public bodies and statutory bodies, so it is not new.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should make it clear that I am not trying to dilute the test. I accept that it should be applied rigorously. The problem is that to reach a competent decision the school board will need to take legal and medical advice. Such advice does not come free. Indeed, it is extremely expensive. Accepting that it is an unlikely but possible occurrence, how will school boards, with their limited resources, find the several hundred pounds that it will cost to take that course of action?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has asked a specific question and I shall try to give a specific answer. I understand that the Secretary of State is involved in cases in local government. I accept the distinction that the hon. Gentleman makes, that the boards are on their own in that respect. I had not considered that point, so I shall take it away and think about what support and assistance would be given to school boards in those circumstances. The hon. Gentleman's point is fair and we may be able to meet it without seeking to amend the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that explanation and I am satisfied with the course of action that he intends to take.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 3, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>

	<div class='clause'>Clause 4</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>QUALIFICATION AND DISQUALIFICATION OF MEMBERS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 148, in page 4, line 12, leave out subsection (2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to establish the thinking behind the Government's choice of the definition, "a minor". A minor is a boy aged 14 to 17 or a girl aged 12 to 17. That is discriminatory and clearly has something to do with the fact that girls mature more quickly than boys and, at that age, are about two years ahead. Why did the Minister choose that formula to apply in this Bill? Our view and that of COSLA is that consideration should be given to using the phrase "a young person" within the meaning of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980—that is, to make it persons aged 16 or 17, persons aged 12 to 17, or
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0938">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>339</span>
pupils attending secondary schools. That formula is already used in education in Scotland. The Minister is proposing a different formula and different criteria. We cannot see the force of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a probing amendment which seeks to clarify the Government's thinking. We are unhappy about two formulae operating at the same time. It does not make much sense and is not good legislation. We should try to be consistent in the rules that apply in all the Education Acts that come on to the statute book. That is the simple purpose of the amendment. I hope that the Minister will explain his intentions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment of the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg). We need clarification because the Bill does not make much sense in proposing different ages for the different sexes. There may be good legal reasons, but why should such a difference be made in the Bill? Technically, the Bill does not make sense on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take a more fundamental view than the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth. In introducing legislation, we all seek the greater participation of parents and pupils, or in industry, of workers and managers in a firm. That general thrust can be seen in all kinds of policies. We must examine this proposal in practical terms. When we considered having school boards, did we envisage relatively young children taking part? I am not saying anything against the ability of many young people below the age of 16 to make a contribution, but given the nature of school boards, is it appropriate for such young people to take part formally in the boards' activities? I believe that a better role for children under the age of 16 would be within the class or the school, perhaps through a prefect system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister has the governing of the school very much in mind. Young people at the upper end of the age bracket could and should have a part to play. Many have a role in the community through youth organisations, and I support the view that those over the age of 16 should be able to stand for and participate in school boards. Beyond the presentational aspect however, is there anything practical to be gained by the participation of those under 16? The age of 16 is specified in the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 and although any choice is slightly arbitrary I believe that 16 is more appropriate and an appropriate legal definition is available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth will go further than his probing amendment. We want the Minister to explain his reasoning and we hope that he will consider an amendment along the lines that I have suggested. That would be more sensible and practical and would achieve our aim of greater participation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be interesting to probe the Minister's mind. I moved an earlier amendment supporting the idea of young people, as defined in existing legislation, being able to vote and I supported an amendment from Labour Members suggesting that these young people should be allowed
	<span class='label label-info column'>340</span>
to be members of school boards. The suggestion that children younger than that should be on the board raises interesting questions. We should at least have the Minister's views on how it might operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one other area in which the views of pupils under the age of 16 should be taken into account, although whether it is appropriate for them to be on the board is another matter. There is a clear dichotomy at the age of 16 between those pupils staying on at school and those who choose to leave, but the academic and educational interests of those children can diverge a year or two before that. It is important that young people under 16 who have a positive attitude towards education but are nevertheless quite sure that they will leave school at 16 should have their views taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that I wish to press—here I support the contributions already made—is whether it is realistic to consider the young people below the age of 16 actively taking part in the decisions of the school board as opposed to being consulted and represented by other board members, perhaps including pupils over 16. I broadly support the amendment. If the Minister stands by the provision and envisages pupils under 16 participating in school boards, how does he think that it would work and how would relationships within the boards be affected? On balance, I think that 16 is a sensible cut-off point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We agree with the right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) and on reflection would be prepared to withdraw the amendment if the Minister would take on board the comments that have been made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At first, I was puzzled by the amendment as it seemed to remove what was intended to be helpful clarifications. I should like to deal first with the reasons for having subsection (2) in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although nothing in law says so specifically, it would probably have been assumed that a minor—that is, a girl between the ages of 12 and 18 or a boy between the ages of 14 and 18—was not legally capable of being a member of a statutory body such as a school board. The purpose of subsection (2) is to remove any doubt. I note what the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) has said, but if we accepted the amendment it would not necessarily mean that minors could not serve only that the matter would once again be in doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note what my right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) and Opposition Members have said. There seems to be a clear view that it would be undesirable for children under 16 to serve on school boards. It has been suggested that we should latch on to the definition of a young person—that is, someone who is over 16 and under 18 I am happy to take the view of the Committee on this. I shall consider the provision with a view to amending the Bill on Report so that youngsters must be over 16 to be eligible for membership of school boards.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have tabled these amendments for two basic reasons which are linked with the status of the education authority. We hope that the Minister will accept that some of his utterances seem to undermine that status whereas others, in which he says that it is a matter of local discretion, seem to give the authority power. Clarity is needed here. Local authorities should be given a clear remit to administer and manage the education system within their areas. They are the authority for that area and are entitled to determine the education policies of that area within the limited scope left to them after the Government's centralisation of education powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the amendments aims to acknowledge the role both of education officers and of elected councillors by enabling them to attend and to speak at school board meetings in their area. As all hon. Members know, there are twin sides to an education authority: the professional authority in the education department and the regional councillors who are elected for a four-year term to be responsible for education policy in their areas. It seems strange that that is not recognised in the establishment of the school boards and that both sides of the authority are not given the right to attend school board
	<span class='label label-info column'>342</span>
meetings. We recognise that it would be inappropriate for them to vote and that there is a degree of decentralisation here, but their roles are ambiguous, particularly that of the elected member who is elected for a four-year term to devise the authority's policies but has no clear-cut right to attend board meetings or to be recognised as a person of significance to the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that that point is catered for in subsection (1), which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An education authority may appoint a person to attend and speak at any meeting of a School Board".</p></blockquote>
The authority could appoint the elected member, but that ignores the other side of the education authority. The easiest way to deal with the problem is to give the right to attend school board meetings both to the elected member and to the professional representative of the education department. No Opposition Member believes that that right will be taken up all that often particularly by the elected member, merely because of the logistics of the situation. There may be a great many primary schools and a significant number, albeit fewer, of secondary schools within a regional councillor's area. Given the councillor's commitments, it would clearly be impossible for him to attend all school board meetings. Nevertheless, it would be an important recognition of the status of the education department and the elected member if they had the right to be there as representatives of the education authority. I commend that argument to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 5(3) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An education authority shall give advice to a School Board in their area when requested on any matter within the Board's competence."</p></blockquote>
It is strange that the authority for the area can give advice only when requested. Such insertions in the Bill make us distrust the Minister when he says that no attempt is being made to undermine the education authority's powers. It seems gratuitous—almost an insult—to insert the phrase "when requested" when it does not need to be there. That seems to make it clear that the school boards will call the shots, rather than the education authority having the right to put its view to the school board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said in earlier sittings of the Committee that we should praise local authorities who have sought to make their education policies explicit. Some have encouraged curriculum development, out-of-school use and links between primary and secondary schools or have reorganised teaching in the early years of secondary school. We should encourage those authorities to make their policies clear to the school boards in their area, rather than simply muddling along with them. Authorities should seek to proselytise their policies in their area. They should make it known to the school boards that they have produced consultation documents or pieces of research on education. It should not be left to the whim of school boards to make sure that they hear about the education authority's policy and work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember many occasions when my local authority was criticised for not having consulted adequately. The education authority should have the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0940">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>343</span>
duty and the right to be at school board meetings to put across its views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More thought needs to be given to the relationship between the education authority, the school board and the head teacher. I am sure that my hon. Friends have already pointed out the increasing ambivalence—or even multivalence—of the head teacher's role. Even now, it is not always clear whether his or her role is to represent the profession or the education authority—whether he or she should be pre-eminently a professional educator or the middle management of the local education authority. If the role of the elected member is not made clear, the role of the head teacher will become even more difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all those reasons, I commend the amendments to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumfries)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a great deal of sympathy with the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington), who made many good points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said on Second Reading that local councillors would lose an important part of their responsibility if they ceased to be involved in developing education policy in schools. I keep harking back to when I was a councillor. Looking after the schools in one's "constituency" was an important part of one's duties, and visiting schools to present prizes at Christmas or on sports day was one of the more enjoyable aspects of being a councillor. Because the councillor visited regularly, he or she was able to represent to the director of education, as chairman of the education committee, what ought to happen, what was good and what was bad, what needed to be improved, and so on. An integral part of a councillor's duty was to look after the local schools. Regional councillors now have a much larger area to look after because the constituencies have been broadened, but they should still look after the schools within their regional constituencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless there is harmony between the education authority and the school board, the setting up of school boards is never likely to achieve success. It is therefore very important that the elected representative should be in touch with everything that happens in the school and the board and thus be able to pass on the information to the education authority and take part in education debates if he is on the education committee. He must be there by right, not as a board member but to sit in, listen and take part in the discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is right to allow two officials to be appointed because in my view the school boards being set up, especially for schools with between 300–500 pupils, are too small. If the local councillor could not attent a meeting an official of the department could at least maintain the continuity of contract between the school board and the education authority. Another official is important because the councillor will represent numerous schools. Meetings may be arranged on he same night and it will not
	<span class='label label-info column'>344</span>
physically be possible for the councillor to attend all of them. Therefore, we need an alternative source of information about education authority policy to be deployed at the meeting so as to keep the essential close contract between the board and the authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie was right to raise the point about the councillor or representative under clause 5 being able to speak only if asked. We must go much further than words such as, "have regard to educational policy", and "if requested to speak", and so on. The representative must be far more involved than those words imply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall no doubt discuss this later in the Bill, but will the press be present? That will be an important issue. It will be a bit rough if the local councilor has to wait to read the local paper to find out what is going on in his own school board. If the board has the right to refuse admittance to the press the councillor will not know the business of the board unil a minute is circulated by the school board to the local council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is simple. Part of the duties of the elected councillor, regardless of whether he is independent or affiliated to a particular party, is to look after the schools for which he is responsible. Unless he can go to the meeting and keep in close contact he will be unable to do his duty. Therefore, it is essential that the elected councillor should be there by right and not by the choice of the education authority. There should also be a second person representing the official side of the education authority so as to ensure that education policy is clear to members of the board when they want information about official policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is much to be said for the amendment and I shall be interested to hear my hon. Friend the Ministers' response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak briefly to amendment No. 57, which makes the specific point put forward by the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro). A regional councillor should have the right to attend meetings of school boards in his or her area. As there are likley to be numerous school boards in the area, no one seriously suggests that the councillor could or would wish to attend all of them, but the right to do so as and when he thinks fit should be accepted. He should do a good job as a local councillor because education is the most important item for which the regional council is responsible and accounts for half its total expenditure and it is absolutely right for any regional councillor to give high priority to educational issues and to have a good, constructive working relationship with schools in his area. It would be improper and inappropriate for a school board to be allowed to exclude a regional councillor. It is important that his right of attendance is an absolute right. I agree with everything that has been said. Nobody suggests that he should have a right to vote, but he should have a right to speak for the benefit of both sides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
School boards are set up specifically to be representative of the exclusive interests of the school, but the councillor represents all taxpayers in his area regardless of whether they have the right of access to a school board. He should be able to put the view of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0941">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>345</span>
the wider community if he believes that a board is taking too narrow a track and making decisions which might exclude or cut across the interests of the wider community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is inappropriate to suggest that the council representative should be nominated by the council rather than being the local councillor as of right. The reason is fairly obvious. If a council were controlled by one party and there was some controversy or contention, the councillor appointed might be from the majority party if the local councillor is from another party, or a different member of the majority party if the local councillor is in that party. That would undermine the local councillor's rights as the elected representative of that area or community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The spirit of the amendments is to try to ensure that the boards are co-operative ventures and partnerships involving everyone in the school. The hon. Member for Dumfries is right that it would be absurd and offensive if a local councillor were denied access to his school board and merely read about contentious or controversial decisions or views in the local press rather than being a party to the discussions or fully informed as to what went on. In such circumstances the local councillor might particularly wish to attend, and if the board were pursuing a policy directly opposed to that of the regional council the councillor would need to know the reason and justifications for that. He should either represent the council view to the board and explain why the council believes that the board is taking a wrong direction or, equally validly, he could represent the boards view to the council and explain why the board wishes to take a different view. The regional councillor is the natural intermediary and the one person whose role is defined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised that the Bill did not make it clear that the local councillor has a right and, to some extent, a duty to attend school boards from time to time. In my area, the local councillor's attendance at the community council is sought and welcomed, and it is constructive for both parties. It not only ensures the councillor knows what is going on, it saves an awful lot of wasted time and effort. The councillor can advise the community council either that issues raised and in hand and will be resolved or that they can be put in hand in a more straightforward way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of all that, I feel strongly that the right of the regional councillor to attend school boards in his area should be accepted. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment or, if he is unable to do that, make it clear that the local councillor should be part of the process and not excluded in a way which could be divisive, cause resentment and frustrate his ability to carry out his duties constructively. The amendments seek to achieve a similar objective and I commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have considerable sympathy with amendment No. 107. The hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) reminded us that we are legislating for partnership in running our schools. In the Bill the emphasis is on partnership
	<span class='label label-info column'>346</span>
between parents, teachers and the community, but there is another important element which my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) and I mentioned a number of times on Second Reading. There must also be partnership with the education authority. It would be wrong if there were divisiveness as between the interests represented by the school boards and those of the education authority which has a statutory responsibility to ensure proper education in its area. That is why I strongly support clause 5(1), which empowers a education authority to
	<br><blockquote><p>"appoint a person to attend and speak"</p></blockquote>
at meetings of school boards. That link is vital and in putting it into the Bill the Government clearly recognises that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only question raised by the amendment is whether the link is strong enough. We must recognise that there are two strands to the local education authority. One is the regional councillor, who has a policy-making role in education; the other is the official of the education authority who has a policy implementation role. If one person only can be appointed, one or other of those two strands will be lost. That is why the education authority should be able to appoint two persons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The role of regional councillors is very important. I endorse every word that has been said about that, particularly by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries. I would not expect regional councillors in rural areas to be physically able to attend every school board meeting, particularly where there are a number of relatively small rural schools. I have discussed this with some of the regional councillors in rural areas of my constituency and they freely acknowledge that they would not be able to attend every school board meeting if they were appointed to attend and to speak. Equally, however, as the hon. Member for Gordon has said, many of them would want to be able to attend on appropriate occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the amendment, I would not expect a regional councillor to attend every meeting, but if the other person nominated by the education authority was an official I would expect him to attend as part of his duties. An individual who is elected by people in the area to represent them on the regional council, which has responsibility for education, should be able to have a direct link with the school board. If the regional councillor attended meetings of the school board, it would reassure the board that it had a direct line, through a locally-elected representative, to the education authority. The board would not need to use that link all the time, but it would help to resolve any difficulties or conflicts that might arise and thus strengthen the kind of partnership that I wish to see as a result of the Bill—a partnership not just of parents and teachers, but one that includes the education authority. Regional councillors should be able to attend and I am sure that school boards would wish them to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. I assume that the regional councillor appointed would be from the ward in which the school was situated. That councillor would provide a useful link between the primary feeder schools and the secondary schools in the area, particularly when difficulties arise. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will consider the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not have the same sympathy with amendment No. 126. If subsection (1) is amended as I suggest, the two persons nominated by the education authority will be able to attend and to speak. Amendment No. 124 seeks to insert a provision that
	<br><blockquote><p>"An education authority shall have the right to give advice to the Board"</p></blockquote>
in its area when requested. If representatives of the education authority can attend and speak, they can also give advice at any time and on any subject, so amendment No. 124 is not necessary. But subsection (3) relates to a different and important situation where a school board may wish to have advice on a subject but the education authority does not choose to give it, for whatever reason. After all, some education authorities have been reluctant to give school councils advice and co-operate with them. Amendment No. 126, however, puts an obligation on education authorities to provide advice when requested in cases where they may not have volunteered advice. Therefore two different aspects are involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities should be able to volunteer advice on any subject within their competence. The Bill should provide that if the local education authority has not given advice and the school board wants that advice, the local authority should be required to provide it when requested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The thrust of amendment No. 107 is correct and amendment No. 57 strengthens it. I hope that we shall move in that direction. Amendment No. 126 is not necessary and if agreed to it would weaken the power of the school board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>[Mr. David Knox 	<i>in the Chair]</i></p>
	<p>The Committee recognises that when school boards are established several changes will have to be made. First, relationships in that sector will have to be strengthened. Secondly, we shall have to
	<span class='label label-info column'>348</span>
establish some climate of co-operation. Thirdly, we should take any step that we can take to overcome the initial suspicions and hostility of the elected members and the education authority. That is why I think that there is an emerging consensus on amendment No. 57. Although there may be disagreement about the overall block of amendments, clearly there is some consensus about the local regional councillor being involved in the work of the school boards.</p>
	<p>I was a regional councillor for several years so I know that because of councillors' commitments it is unlikely that they will be able to attend school board meetings. However, the opportunity to do so will be a significant step forward in the Bill. It will offer the hand of friendship and co-operation to an essential link in the chain of accountability within any local community.</p>
	<p>There are three qualities in the amendment that I support, the first is continuity. When the boards are established, some of the new people elected will have a limited knowledge of education, distinct from their direct interest in their own children. Therefore, it would be useful at the start for the local regional councillor to be represented as he could bring a degree of continuity, advice and knowledge to the board were his comments sought.</p>
	<p>The second quality is communication. The right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) has made the point about the links with the non-staff, non-educational part of the wider community. The local regional councillors should provide two links; one between the school board and the wider community of interests in an area, and, secondly, a link between the school board and the regional council—in particular, the education authority. It is a commonsense initiative that would help bind relationships more strongly and give the school boards a greater chance of success once they have been established.</p>
	<p>The third quality is trust and confidence within the community, which can be trite phrase. However, at the start educationalists and councillors will have lingering doubts about the school boards' role in what has traditionally been the preserve of the local authority, and in particular the education authority. It would be beneficial if the local regional councillor, regardless of party persuasion, was involved with the school board from the start. That would not only build links, but would establish in the community the confidence in the belief that the school boards were worthy of trust. It would also allow the local regional councillor to partake of his democratically elected duties and more important, to help to establish the credibility of school boards by his presence in the community and the trust he holds as one of the elected members. Therefore, in terms of confidence, communication and continuity, it would be common sense for amendment No. 57 to be accepted, together with the other amendments.</p>

I know from my experience as a regional councillor that I gained a great deal from my attendance at the school councils in my area. I know from speaking to the present chairmen of school councils in Dundee that they take great note of which councillors do and do not attend and take an interest in the activities of local school councils. Therefore, there are benefits for the regional councillor, who can keep in touch with what is going on in his local school, and also for the board that will learn much more about the education authorities' activities. Councillors and Members of Parliament are involved in the day-to-day running of councils and Parliament, and know what is going on, but we sometimes forget that outside people often do not know what is happening inside those institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, Tayside regional council serves a huge area and nearly 400,000 people. The workings of the education committee will largely be a mystery to the majority of constituents and of those comprising the school boards. So it is necessary for the local regional councillor to be able to answer any questions about the edcuation authority's policies that may affect the school board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a danger of major decisions on education provision becoming remote from ordinary people interested in local schools. School councils were created to provide two-way communication between the education authority—the education committee and its officers—and the local community, so that both would know what the other was doing and learn from it. I am not sure whether school boards will be able to fill the role that was so adequately filled by school councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 5(1) states that an education authority will have the right to appoint a person who may speak at a school board meeting. Subsection (3) will allow the education authority to advise "when requested", and subsection (4) specifies that that advice will be considered by the school board. The Minister must clarify the difference between being able to attend a board meeting and being able to speak at one and give advice. Subsection (3) seems to suggest that while the representative of the education authority may attend a school board meeting, he or she has no right to give advice on any subject under discussion unless the board requests such advice. That is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having the right to give advice is not the same as having the right to speak. The Minister must tell us whether he believes that that is the same. Important matters will come under the competence of a school board in which the education authority has a clear interest. For example, school boards will have the right to approve their per capita expenditure on books and materials, as suggested by the local head teacher. Most school boards will agree with the head teacher's suggestions. But a school board may be out of line with a head teacher and with some of the policies and approaches locally adopted by the education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be much growth in policies aimed at adopting a multi-cultural and anti-racist approach to education. Although the Bill provides that that will lie within the competence of the education authority,
	<span class='label label-info column'>350</span>
the local head teacher must still buy books and materials that fit in with such policies. The head teacher's suggestions may fall foul of the point of view of the school board, which may not approve the purchase of books and equipment that may be geared to a particular policy development within the education authority's remit. That may involve not only anti-racism, but sex education, religious education a single Christianity or multi-religious approach and trade unionism. A local school board may say that it does not want books about trade unions or sex education, and so cause a period of conflict.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would be less likely to happen if the education authority had the right to be represented, not merely through an official who carries out the policies, but through an elected member who can give the rationale and arguments behind why the education authority requested that such a policy be pursued and certain books purchased. It is important that the education authority should have more than one representative and that those representatives should have the right to put their point of view to the school board on whatever is being discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same goes for the school board's right to control out-of-hours use of the school. The board will be dominated by parents of pupils who attend the school. But, of course, the school is used by many more people in the community than just the children who are there from 9 o'clock to 4 o'clock every day. Other elements that use the school in the events will not necessarily be represented on the school board. There are housing estates in Dundee where, in the evenings, primary schools are not necessarily used by pupils but by adolescents who have nowhere else to go. All kinds of games and meetings can take place in such primary schools. What happens if a school board decides that it does not want local adolescents to have access to the school, because they cause a bit of damage or spoil the paintwork? It is important that, in such circumstances, the education authority should be represented on school boards and put across the views of groups that otherwise would not be represented in the boards' considerations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can extend this argument to the rights of school boards regarding senior staff appointments. I understand that the school board will nominate its representative to the appointment committee and will also have the right to delete names from shortlists for the position of head teacher in the school. It is vital that the employment policies adopted by an education authority are taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many education authorities are equal opportunity employers. It is important that their view is put across clearly and coherently at the meetings of the school board when they nominate the person whom they wish to represent them on the appointments committee or when they consider the shortlist for the head teacher. If education authority representatives do not have the right to put across those views, we could find ourselves in troubled waters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If having the right to appoint a person to speak is the same as having the right to appoint a person with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0944">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>351</span>
the right to give advice—whether or not the school board wants that advice at the time—that is fine, but the Minister should say so. He should also explain why, if it is right for the education authority to appoint one person as an official, it is not right for it to appoint a local elected member. Such a person would be in a position to contribute to the policy creation side of education decisions and be able to carry out the remit regarding the policy implementation. Both strands of the education authority's decision-making process should be represented on school boards.

I hope that the Minister will deal clearly with the difference between subsections (1) and (3) and tell us whether education authority representatives have the right to give advice to school boards, whether or not the boards wish to hear that advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support amendments Nos. 107, 126 and 57. Amendment No. 107 refers to subsection (1) of clause 5. As it stands, the subsection recognises the need for local authority links with school boards. As the right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) implied, is that strong enough? Obviously the school board and the education authority cannot function without those links being made effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main issue in the clause is how the school board and the education authority collaborate with each other. Officials and elected members can bring different sorts of expertise to the school board. The policy-making contribution of the councillor and policy implementation by the official have been mentioned. As neither will be full board members, there is no danger in allowing two appointees to the board. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 126 seeks to make explicit what should have been in the clause in any event. It would simply be of interest for authorities to appoint anyone to represent them on a board if their remit were only to listen. But we need more than that, because we are discussing partnership in running the schools. We are talking about the partnership that parents will have with the local education authority, the community and the regional councillor. Therefore, the local education authority must have the right to appoint people whose voices will be heard. It is clear that it plays an extremely important role for at the end of the day it has responsibility for the decisions of the school board, as is mentioned elsewhere in the Bill. The amendment will not threaten the role of parents on the board because local authorities have the statutory duties, which the boards will be instrumental in carrying out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of my hon. Friends spoke from their experience as councillors on local education authorities. I can contribute to the debate by talking about my experience as a school teacher for many years. In my opinion, the role of the regional councillor is crucial to the school's policies, particularly its community development policies. Over the past decade it has been incumbent on schools to become involved in the community, and
	<span class='label label-info column'>352</span>
to do so schools must have a panoramic vision of the community. I contend that the only person who has that vision is the regional councillor, whose facilitating role is extremely important for schools. I have been indepted to regional councillors in various schools in which I have worked for facilitating the policy of the school and implementing community development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The role of the regional councillor has also been important in putting the school's view to the local education authority. Thus the regional councillor acts as a channel both to the community and to the local education authority. I strongly support amendment No. 57, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The regional councillor … may attend and speak at meetings of the School Board".</p></blockquote>
Some members of the Committee said that the regional councillor does not need to attend those meetings, but he or she should have the opportunity to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments support the school, the parents and, above all, the concept of partnership and development in schools. On that basis, I ask the Minister to accept them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not able to accept any of the amendments, and I shall try to explain my reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the exception of amendment No. 57, I am slightly puzzled by the amendments, which were proposed by COSLA. The original proposals contained in our consultative paper provided for education authorities to have a non-voting seat on each board in their area. In its responses to our consultation COSLA argued that it would have difficulty in finding members and staff sufficient to be able to attend all board meetings. In recognition of that view, we made the provisions for authority representation very flexible. Authorities may send a representative to meetings whenever they wish. The representative can be an elected member. I accept the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) and my right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) about the vital role which regional councillors must play. The Bill provides that a regional councillor may go to school board meetings as the local authority's representative, and even provides that the representative need not be the same person from one meeting to another. So there is provision for the regional councillor to attend and for an official to replace him if he is unable to attend, or for other persons nominated by the education authority to attend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the basis of what the Minister has just said, I am worried that the council could nominate the regional councillor but, equally, it might not, particularly if he is of a different political persuasion from the controlling council. Yet he is the local representative, and that is the critical point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with that, but, first, I give way to my right honourable Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The initiative is with the education authority to appoint. It can nominate one person, so it is impossible to maintain that it might be one person or it might be another. The power to nominate rests with the education authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right honourable Friend and the hon. Gentleman are right. It might not be true of what my right honourable Friend has been saying, but one of the complaints made by the Opposition is that we are undermining the local authority's power. Indeed, the hon. Member for Gordon has made some play on that issue. He is now arguing that the Government should go further in taking away the patronage enjoyed by the education authority in terms of its ability to appoint representatives to express its view and make representations on its behalf within the school boards. The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) has also made great play of that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie, mentioned the giving of advice. I shall not deal with that now because we shall discuss the education authority's precise role in giving advice and the school boards' duties in taking account of it during the debate on amendment No. 124.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have provided for the regional council representation to be entirely flexible. That was part of the package that we announced in January, which was widely welcomed. We took account of the worries expressed by COSLA about finding representation. I was astounded, indeed, staggered, to be confronted with a request for two representatives on the boards. I accept the point made by my right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside that there is a difference of approach between elected members and officials. However, that does not justify providing two places on each board for authority representatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible for an authority to send either a member or an official, as deemed appropriate for the issue under consideration. I again agree with my right honourable Friend, who said that it is not practical in rural areas for regional councillors to attend every board meeting. Allowing various persons to attend on the authority's behalf provides for a vital input—the link with education authorities—which my right honourable Friend identified as important. Our original thinking required that there should be such a person, but COSLA in particular argued that that would put an undue burden on local authorities. As we are a helpful Government and try to respond to COSLA when we can—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend the Minister acknowledge that although I am interested
	<span class='label label-info column'>354</span>
in COSLA's representations, I did not speak to the amendment at the inspiration of COSLA. I did so after discussing the matter with regional councillors in my own area. I am not convinced by the argument that the amendment should be rejected merely because COSLA has allegedly changed its view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand my right honourable Friend's wish to distance himself from COSLA. I shall try to deal with his arguments but, first, I wish to say that COSLA is, at least in theory, supposed to represent local authorities. It has stood on its head and taken up a position entirely different from its original one—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I have not yet dealt with the merits of my right honourable Friend's case. I wish merely to deal with his anxieties. If he is worried that local authorities will not appoint a local regional councillor as their representative—the hon. Member for Gordon. (Mr. Bruce) has already voiced that fear—I can assure him that the Bill provides for school boards to invite whomsoever they like to their meetings, which means that they would be able to invite the regional councillor to attend. If the local authority does not send a regional councillor, the school board will be able to invite him or her.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will not the Minister accept that that is unsatisfactory? There may be circumstances in which the school board will not wish to invite the local councillor. We are seeking to ensure that the local regional councillor will have the right to attend. We are not talking about voting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 57 was not inspired by COSLA. It is entirely my own amendment and if the wording is infelicitous, I accept responsibility for it. However, it makes clear and simple point that could easily be incorporated into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said at the beginning of my remarks that the amendments, with the exception of No. 57, had been put forward by COSLA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill makes provision for the school board to invite whom it likes to attend and to speak at its meetings in clause 6(10), which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A School Board may invite to attend any of their meetings and to speak any person whose presence they consider to be desirable for the purpose of giving advice to the Board regarding, or representing persons interested in, the matters under discussion."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman argued that there may be circumstances in which a school board may not wish to invite its regional councillor, but I am bound to say that I find it difficult to think of any such circumstances. The hon. Gentleman postulated that the local authority will not be prepared to nominate the regional councillor and the school board not be prepared to invite him or her. That would reflect a democractic view, which should be respected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 6(10) mentions "matters under discussion". That leads us to think that the councillor would be invited only to a particular meeting at a particular time, if it was of particular interest to the board to have his or her comments on the subject under discussion. The subsection could
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0946">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>355</span>
be used by a political party to squeeze out an elected councillor because it does not like his or her political colour. It is clearly not possible to suggest that clause 6(10) is the same as amendment No. 57. It is entirely different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that that was obvious; that is what we are discussing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not accept it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must accept that I take a different view from him here. If the school boards wish to invite a regional councillor or if he is nominated by the authority as the representative, he is able to attend. But he would not be able to attend every meeting of every school board. There will be occasions when it would be appropriate for a councillor to attend and there will be others when an official would be appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a parallel here with community councils. I know it can be difficult for regional councillors to attend every community council meeting, but in my part of Scotland regional councillors make real efforts to attend community council meetings when they can. We should make it possible for regional councillors to attend school board meetings should they so wish, not only if they are invited.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That sounds fine in theory but what happens when two regional councillors both have an interest in a school where the delineated area covers more than a ward? Which councillor would have the right to attend the meetings? Ultimately it would be for the education authority to nominate whichever councillor it considered appropriate. There would be definitional problems. The hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) was at great pains to tell the Committee that we are taking on board English practices in education, but there are no catchment areas in schools in Scotland. Instead, there are delineated areas. Catchment areas is an English term, which renders amendment No. 57 technically deficient. Moreover it is highly unlikely that the delineated area will always conform to electoral boundaries. The amendment does not take account of the cases where two or more regional councillors have an interest in a school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, local authorities and school boards will take account of a regional councillor's interest in particular schools. There is provision in the Bill for them to show flexibility and to allow regional councillors to be representatives where they consider it appropriate. If there were two local authority representatives on each school board and officials had to attend every meeting, the costs about which Opposition Members and my hon. Friends have complained would be substantially increased. I must advise the Committee to reject the amendments in interests of local flexibility that will enable the right persons to attend the board in the most appropriate circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>356</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to reconsider this matter. It must be obvious to him from the simple arithmetic that he will not win the argument on what he has advanced so far. He does not seem to accept the problem of regional councillors not being able to attend school board meetings. The trouble is that Scotland is not the same all over. In my area there are relatively few secondary schools and, therefore, relatively few regional councillors to be responsible for each school. There will be no difficulty sorting that out. If there is, we can correct the bad drafting in the Bill and introduce a new opportunity for regional councillors, as of right, to look after their own local schools on Report. If we accept that they are elected by proper democratic means, we must give them the opportunity to look after one of the most important local authority issues in their area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a county councillor I should have been horrified not to have had the opportunity, as of right, to take an interest in schools. In those days the local education board decided on letting schools for various purposes, but that was the bare minimum of what would be considered as a school board today. One went to meetings as of right as the local councillor. One made up the quorum and held a formal position. We do not ask for that, we simply ask for the right to be present. We do not expect the regional councillor to be appointed by the education authority—the politics of that authority may prevent him from being appointed or by the school board. Neither of those positions are tenable for a local elected councillor. He should have a position as of right, not at the behest of the education authority or school board. Will my hon. Friend take the Bill away and resolve this simple problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend believe that the local authority appointee should be, as of right, the regional councillor, or does he want an additional local authority representative? If he is arguing for the former, I shall be happy to consider it. That was not clear from his remarks, with which I have some sympathy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regional councillor could belong to a particular party but the controlling group could belong to another. The Conservative party might be anxious about such instances and about current circumstances in local government in Scotland. Will my hon. Friend make his position clear?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had made it absolutely clear. I believe that, irrespective of party politics, it is essential that the local elected regional councillor should have the right to be present in the school board. My point is as simple as that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend is saying that I should take the Bill away on the basis that we should find an opportunity for the regional councillor to be the local authority representative, as of right, I am happy to give that undertaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the Minister's arguments on the feasibility of officials or councilors

attending school boards. He used the same argument in reverse to criticise us our earlier amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has concentrated on amendments Nos. 57 and 107 to the exclusion of amendments Nos. 126 and 125. Why did he reject those reasonable requests? It is not good enough for representatives of the council or regional councillors just to be entitled to attend meetings. They should be entitled to have their voice heard and give advice on matters that affect the policy of education authorities. Education authorities spend vast amounts of public money on education. Therefore, their views should be taken properly into account by school boards when reaching decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Far be it from me to advise the hon. Gentleman, but it may be more appropriate to discuss the question of advice and the duties of the boards to accept advice under the next amendment. With regard to my comments to my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) and to the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce), I gave the undertaking to think again in respect of the sentiments expressed in amendment No. 57 rather than those contained in the other amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for agreeing to think again, but I am slightly worried that his answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) on amendment No. 57 is a case of either-or. I shall not repeat the arguments that I put forward earlier because I do not want to detain the Committee and I hope that we shall be able to reach a sensible conclusion on the subject. However, we are talking about partnership and I mentioned that there are two strands in an education authority. First, there is a policy-making strand, with which regional councillors are concerned. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries demonstrated so forcefully, an integral part of that strand is the role of the local regional councillor. The second important strand concerns the implementation of policy and the continuity that may be given by someone from the education authority—the Bill recognises that. Not all local regional councillors will be members of the education committee and a link must also be provided for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not ask my hon. Friend the Minister for a definitive answer this morning. However, I hope that by agreeing to consider the role that the local regional councillor may play, he is not dismissing the link with the education authority, perhaps through an official of that authority. I know that he is anxious not to add to the boards unnecessarily, but we want to make them effective and later we do not want to discover that we have missed out important elements. Will he assure the Committee that, by agreeing to consider the role of the local regional councillor, he is not presenting us with an either-or situation and that he will keep an open mind. I would certainly find it difficult to live with the commitment that he has given this morning if I thought that he was in any way closing his mind to what is presently contained in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>358</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful that the Minister is prepared to reconsider the suggestion. My amendment entirely answers the point raised by the right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith). Clause 5(1) would still read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An education authority may appoint a person to attend and speak at any meeting of a School Board in their area, but he shall not be a member of the Board."</p></blockquote>
The amendment would add to that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The regional councillor for the school's catchment area may attend and speak at meetings of the School Board for that school."</p></blockquote>
It is absolutely clear that my amendment adds the regional councillor, as of right, as an appointee of the council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a clear consensus across the Committee that the regional councillor should be an additional representative. The Minister does not need to be apprehensive about that. We have all shown that, in practice, the regional councillor will unable attend every school board meeting regularly. However, it is an important principles that he or she should have the right to do so. The regional councillor would not have a vote and therefore he or she would not alter the balance. Their role would be one of partnership, exchange of information and advice. As long as that is clearly understood I am greateful to the Minister and I feel that we have pressed the debate to what appears to be a constructive conclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to see signs of movement from the Minister on this question. He said that the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities had pointed out that councillors and members of the authority could not attend all the meetings of school boards. That is absolutely right. However, it is unacceptable for the Minister then to say, "They said they could not attend, therefore they will not be able to attend".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is not a rural versus urban one—it is an issue for all regional councillors. Children from the area that I used to represent attended around a dozen primary schools and four secondary schools. It would be physically impossible for a regional councillor to attend meetings in all those schools. The question is about the relationship between the school board and the regional councillors and the education authority and establishing the right of regional councillors and education authorities to receive the minutes and agendas of the meetings of school boards in their areas. That way they will know about important issues being raised at meetings, and which ones they should attend. That is their right to choose. We have heard that phrase before, but as soon as the immortal words "the right to choose" are uttered those who are not here disappear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister means what he said about partnership, it is a question of building up the relationship between parents, schools, the elected members and the authority. That is extremely important because we all know what happens if the elected member or representative of the authority is not at the meetings. There is a process of scape-goating and those who are not present tend to be blamed for what has happened. Frequently, the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0948">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>359</span>
presence of an elected member or a representative of the authority would enable matters to be dealt with simply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's response was extraordinary. He said that he had retained flexibility. The clause says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An education authority may appoint a person to attend".</p></blockquote>
Everyone who reads that will assume that a person will be nominated to attend the meetings, if he or she wishes, at the beginning of a regional council's term. The Minister seems to be saying something completely different. He seems to be saying that the regional council can decide, from meeting to meeting, who should attend. That proposal would be imposible to operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two strands of the education authority must be recognised—the elected members and the regional departments of education. We are trying to get the relationship right. It is not enough to say that the school board may call in the authority or the elected member. That is the wrong relationship because the education authority and the elected member are then seen as being accountable and subservient to the school board. The right relationship is one in which information can be shared and different perspectives discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We therefore encourage the Minister to reconsider the proposals. He must realise that the expression of partnership in the clause is not right. It is not clear about the desirable relationship. The Minister should take account of what has been said with remarkable unanimity this morning about the need to recognise the twin sides of an education authority—the elected members and the department of education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall not press the amendments if the Minister will give us a commitment to recognise the authority's two strands—the making and the implementing policy. That is the thrust of the argument put by the Opposition and others this morning. We want an unequivocal response from the Minister on those points before making up our minds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether I can go as far as the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) wants. I have said that I am happy to undertake to look at this matter again. I have noted the strength of feeling. I take the point made by my right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith). I have reservations about loading the boards with two local authority representatives, but I will consider the arguments. Should we be convinced by those arguments, we can put matters right on Report. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will seek leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note what the Minister has said. His explanation was less than fulsome in making things clear, but I appreciate that he has undertaken to come back to this on Report. I hope that he will bring forward a proposal allowing the authority to appoint someone and the regional councillor to attend as of right. I do not agree that having two such members
	<span class='label label-info column'>360</span>
is unacceptable, especially as we all acknowledge that the regional councillor will not always be able to attend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is understandably anxious to consult his officials. The Committee's view is that the regional councillor's rights must be enshrined—I think that that is a firm undertaking—and that a local authority representative, probably an official, should also be there. I want to put that on record because when the matter comes up on Report I hope that that will be accepted. If not, I and others will be anxious to table an amendment to ensure that that is taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Goverment will honour their commitment and I am glad that we managed to achieve consensus in the Committee and to change the Ministers mind. That is what the Committee stage should be all about. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have made the position clear I have said that I will think about the arguments that have been put in the Committee.

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatives.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cumbernauld and Kilsyth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment no. 124, in Page 4, line 26, leave out subsection (3) and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) An education authority shall have the right and, if requested by the School Board, the duty to give advice to the Board on any matter within the Board's competence".</p></blockquote>
The Bill recognises that to carry out its duties effectively a school board should be in receipt of advice and information relating to professional and policy matters. The manner in which that it to be achieved creates a division between the role of the head teacher who has a right to advise—and a duty, if so requested—and the education authority which may give advice when requested by the school board. The immediate significance of that may escape you, Mr. Knox, but it would be strange if the head teacher had the right to advise and the education authority, which is finally accountable in law for what happens in education throughout its area of jurisdiction, can give advice only when requested. I can scarcely believe that the Minister intended that result when he drafted the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the school boards and the education authority are to operate in partnership, it is imperative that the boards receive the fullest possible advice on the authority's education policies, which are of key importance to the schools under its jurisdiction. It is not conducive to creating the best atmosphere between the parties involved—the parent members, the staff members, the education authority and the head teacher—if the authority has to wait for an invitation from the board before it can tender advice. Although there are major differences between the two
	<span class='label label-info column'>362</span>
sides of the Committee about the future of education in Scotland, the Opposition recognises that school boards will be set up and that there is a strong case from day one to extend parental influence in the mangement of our schools. It is important to get everything right now so that we shall not need to come back to the matter later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot understand why the headmaster should give advice as of right and the education authority only if invited to do so by the board. That is a Forsythism. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] The Minister has become a trifle more pragmatic and all Scotland is agog—it has to do with the cutting of a pack of cards in Stirling on Thursday night.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has been reasonable in accepting amendments where he has recognised the arguments. He has defended his corner and argued his case, but he has changed his mind when we have persuaded him to do so. He has said that he "will take it away"—the House of Commons code that we all understand, I hope that I can persuade him again at least to take the amendment away or to say that it was not the intention to strike a different attitude as between the head teacher and the authority in terms of giving advice to a school board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that our debate on head teachers is well known and well recorded, although I did not see the article in 	<i>The Times Educational Supplement</i> last Friday which mentioned the case of the head teacher at Paisley grammar school. My view of the head teacher's role in the overall management of an education authority is well known. Head teachers are officers of the authority and the head teacher has two roles vis-à-vis the school board. First, he is the immediate manager of the school and should, as of right, give advice to the board. I do not dissent from that. Secondly, he is the officer of the authority and is under an obligation to explain the policy of the education authority. If there is a conflict of interest on the school board about which the head teacher and the board members feel strongly, the education authority's case must not go by default. That is not in the interests of good management. It could go by default with the Bill's present drafting as it does not give the authority the right to attend and make its case as of right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister to put the headteacher and the authority on a par with regard to their right to give advice so that there is no conflict of interest. If such a conflict arose where the headmaster and the board had one view and the education authority had another, the authority could come and explain its view to the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another good reason for that. I think that I know local government officers as well as anyone could know that special breed of people for whom I have some respect, won over a long period of working for them. We must not let them off the hook. It must not be possible for them to avoid attending an awkward board meeting because they do not have the right to be there, and because no member of the authority's management can instruct them to be present. It must be incumbent upon them to attend a difficult meeting of the board and explain their views and the authority's policy. Despite my respect
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0950">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>363</span>
for local government officers, I do not want them let off the hook.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister has accepted the merits of the argument and that he will take my views on board. If not, I hope that he will give us one of his explanations. The last one must have been held up because of the Divisions. If he cannot accept my views, perhaps he will reconsider the matter, or tell me that I have misunderstood the Bill. I do not think that I have misunderstood it as it is written clearly in plain English, and there is no one like a Scot for understanding plain English as it is wrote. I think that what is proposed is wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to speak in semaphore or morse code, as it were, or whatever the hon. Gentleman was using. However, I think that we are on the same wavelength. In some ways the Bill and the Minister seem to be seeking to distance school boards from the education authority. In my part of the world, both are close together and much in harmony, as there are no doctrinaire policies. The education authority is not worried about party policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a great pity not to have a close liaison between the education authority and the school board, as of right. I do not like the idea of certain people attending meetings only if requested. There should be direct representation—not in voting—to give a viewpoint on the education authority's main policy at a school board meeting. Surely most members of the board would welcome it, especially as most school boards are far too small. It is vital to the smooth operation of the board for an authority representative to be present to speak, but not to vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister knows, my education authority has been positive and responsible. I am glad to know that the Minister is meeting the chairman of my education authority in the not-too-distant future. There is concern that school boards will go off on side tracks and will adopt entirely different policies from the education authorities, perhaps out of sheer ignorance about the working of an Act of Parliament or an important issue such as transport for school children in rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot see anything wrong in having a member of the authority present. It should be left to his discretion whether he attends meetings, but as long as he receives the minutes he can see what is on the agenda. If he decides that his presence is necessary to guide the board on an important point, it is right that he should be there to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have much sympathy with the amendment and shall be interested to hear the response of my hon. Friend the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can reassure my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) about the authority's right to receive the minutes. I can also reassure him regarding his anxiety that the authority might not have the rights to advise the board on its policy or any other matter which it considered appropriate. There is no question about
	<span class='label label-info column'>364</span>
the authorities' rights to give advice to the boards. Indeed, there is nothing to prevent the authorities giving the boards any advice that they wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 107 is unnecessary. It would have two main effects. It would give authorities a statutory right to advise their boards as well as a duty to do so when requested. It would attract the provisions in clause 5(4) and so oblige the boards to consider any advice given by the authorities. As the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) said, it would, on the face of it, put the authority in the same position as the head teacher in advising the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for having to define the position of the head teacher in the Bill is that he has no substantial prior locus in statute. It was necessary to establish clearly his right and duty to advise his board. To reassure my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries, let me tell him that the authority has a clear statutory position in relation to the overall management of the education system, and its right to advise the board flows from that. What is required is to establish a duty on the authority to give advice when requested and the Bill provides that. That would deal with the possibility—although I am sure that it would never occur—of an authority not responding to a request for advice. The authority's ability to give advice is not in doubt and stems from its statutory obligation. Therefore, I hope that I can persuade the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth to withdraw the amendment and reassure my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Much as I would like to, I cannot speak for the Minister's hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro). On the basis of what the Minister has said, I am prepared to withdraw the amendment, partly because we shall be reinforcing our view of the role of the authority when we debate the next amendment and other parts of the Bill. After having considered what the Minister has said more carefully and at greater length, I may return to the issue on Report. For the moment, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 149, in page 4, line 30, leave out subsection (5).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 149 is concerned with the role of the head teacher. We are seeking clarification on the implications of subsection (5) on the contractual commitment of head teachers to work additional hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Bill stands, local education authorities will have total commitment to ensuring that head teachers attend all meetings of the school boards. Let us take, for example, a large secondary school where evening meetings, if held, could be frequent. There could be one a month, lasting three hours, which would mean that approximately 30 hours of the head teacher's contractual commitment would be taken up. That has obvious implications for the technicalities of current conditions of service, which give head teachers the same obligations as those of other teachers in terms of additional hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0951">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>365</span>
The conditions of service allow 50 hours for planned activities, and 30 hours for parental meetings. The role of the head teacher is defined as the board's principal professional advisor. If head teachers use up 30 hours attending school board meetings, they may not be able to fulfil their obligations to the local education authority and effectively to discharge their duties of supervision and availability. Considering the pivotal role of the head teacher in promoting the school's planned activities and being involved in parental meetings, the amendment, though probing, also has implications for the head teacher's role. What does the Minister mean by subsection (5)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The position is quite straightforward. The key is the phrase:
	<br><blockquote><p>"such steps as are appropriate".</p></blockquote>
That allows authorities to take account of agreements which may be in force at any time. The hon. Gentleman's anxiety about terms and conditions of service in making staff available for board activities is covered by subsection (5).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the subsection is to place a statutory duty on education authorities to make head teachers and staff available to carry out the functions that the Bill requires of them and to give effect to the board's decisions. The subsection deals with the unlikely circumstance in which the local authority may be tempted not to provide its staff with the opportunity to carry out the board's functions, but it is tempered by the phrase, "as are appropriate", which meets the hon. Gentleman's anxieties. In those circumstance, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will seek leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have referred to clause 5 and to the notes on clauses, but the Minister has not cleared up the point. Many hours of planned activity and parental meetings time will be taken up by the head teacher's attendance at the board. Clause 5(5) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"take such steps as are appropriate".</p></blockquote>
Given that the head teacher it defined as the board's principal professional advisor, the head teacher's attendance at a school board meeting is not only essential but mandatory. That has implications for the extra hours that the head teacher will be required to work. The Minister's explanation is not entirely satisfactory. I shall not press the amendment, but ask the Minister to bear my comments in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman made a different point about the additional load on staff arising from the school boards. I have mentioned that in considering the teaching provision within schools we shall take account of the additional duties arising out of the existence of school boards. I hope that that will reassure the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 108, in page 4, line 35, at end insert—
	<span class='label label-info column'>366</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"(6) In exercising his responsibilities in relation to the activities of the School Board the headteacher will remain accountable to the education authority in accordance with the terms of the relevant Contract of Employment."</p></blockquote>
This amendment is supported by COSLA and it matters to the Bill because of the importance of the head teacher. Over the years, we have become accustomed to the importance of head teachers. They embody the special relationship between the education authority and the school. They occupy a pivotal position and form a meeting point between the local authority, the parents and the children. For all those reasons, we are anxious to make the role of the head teacher clear in the context of the changes proposed by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to confirm the accountability of the head teacher to the education authority. We have exercised our minds on this issue for two days now and it would be wrong of me to repeat all the arguments that have been put forward. Suffice it to say that the head teacher must be the representative of the authority in the school. He or she is an officer of the authority. Head teachers do not occupy their position as a consequence of a decision of the parents, although the Minister might have liked to introduce something like that when he brought forward his ceiling powers. The Bill does not envisage that head teachers should be chosen by parents and that is not what parents and communities want. Everyone agrees that the role of the head teacher should not change, so it must be stated clearly that the head teacher is an officer of the local authority and accountable to the authority. That is the first thing that the amendment seeks to assert and to emphasise in statute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to avoid creating conflicting responsibilities which could jeopardise the arrangement between head teacher and local authority. That is important. I understand what the Minister said on the previous amendment and I shall come back to that in the context of what we are seeking to do in this amendment. It is important that those elected to serve on a school board have a clear grasp of the role of the head teacher. We must not allow the members of the board to consider the head teacher has one of their own people, to think that they can direct what he or she may or may not do or that they can ask him or her to take up a position that is at variance with the education policy of the education authority. None the less, there must be some flexibility. I accept that the head teacher has a duty to report to the education authority from time to time that his board takes a particular view of a particular matter. We seek to avoid conflict, not to prevent representation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
