</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 74, 60 and 76 are also in my name. Amendment No. 74 seeks to increase the number of members on the Scottish Homes board. Amendment No. 60 seeks to make the membership of Scottish Homes reflect the geographical and political nature of Scotland, and amendment No. 76 seeks to allow the Secretary of State to satisfy himself that the interests of tenants and the housing
	<span class='label label-info column'>304</span>
association movement are represented in the membership of Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not need as protracted a debate on these amendments as we had on the previous group. The issue is clear, but nevertheless important, and the question is how the Government envisage membership of Scottish Homes will be constituted. Strong representations have been made to me that a system of indirect election, through the local authorities or COSLA, for example, should be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Have the Government ruled out the idea of moving even informally and unofficially to a system that would give places to people from the local authorities? Some of the local authorities in the borders have argued strongly for such places, particularly for the rural authorities. As the Minister knows, the small rural authorities have special problems peculiar to them and they fear that they will be frozen out from membership of Scottish Homes. Of course, a system of indirect election would have a fairly rigid effect and I accept that it might entail some difficulties, but I should like the Minister to say whether indirect election to membership of Scottish Homes has been considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 73 seeks to ensure that the members of Scottish Homes are resident in Scotland. I think that it is important that they should be. The Minister founded his defence against accepting earlier amendments on the question of precedent, and often it was all that he could plead in aid. I hope that he will recognise that there is quite a large difference between taking people from the Scottish Development Agency and the Highlands and Islands Development Board and bringing people furth of Scotland to serve on Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an argument for bringing someone from England if he has special expertise. There is a prospective application for the post of vice chairman of the Highlands and Islands Development Board from someone in England. I forget his name, but someone has been lined up to take on the job because of his special expertise in finance for small businesses. In such circumstances, I believe that there might be a case for looking for the best man with the best skills available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if the Minister used precedents of that sort to argue that there should be members of Scottish Homes who come from furth of Scotland, it would be wholly unacceptable, certainly to me and, I suspect, to other Opposition Members. Scotland has a peculiar and distinct housing system that has been built up over many years. Given its traditional set-up, it would not be right to bus in people from outside. I hope that the Minister will give us an assurance on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that amendment No. 73 might be slightly restrictive, and I shall wait to hear what assurances the Minister can give us if he is not prepared to accept it. I hope that he can go a long way towards saying that there are very few, if any, foreseeable circumstances that would favour somebody coming from England or Wales to sit on the Scottish Homes board, which would be difficult for people in Scotland to accept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0247">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>305</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does not argue that his amendment is perfect, and surely he appreciates that it could exclude people who spend more time in England than in Scotland, as he does? Scottish talent is diverted to the running of English industries, for example, and such people live in Scotland for part of the time but in England or London for a greater time. We would not want to exclude them from membership of Scottish Homes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with that. I am more interested in the spirit of the amendment than its technical wording. I should not want to rule out anyone of Scottish origin who has spent some time in England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about Woodstock?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not running a book on who might become a member of the Scottish Homes board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Talking of Woodstock, there is no way to get to Paxton without spending most of the time getting there in England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where from?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Paxton is a place that is very near and dear to my heart, as the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) knows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 74 is a probing amendment to determine why the Government have selected nine as the right number of members for Scottish Homes. Some thought must have been given to that figure. It is difficult to see how the various strands of interest that will be involved in the arguments that the Scottish Homes board will consider can be reconciled in a group of nine people. A body such as Scottish Homes cannot be organised with a board the size of some public meetings. In the Liberal party, one gets used to addressing an audience of three. There must be a small, tightly-knit group of people, but why nine?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Try a jury.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not? They could spend their time wondering who were the innocent or guilty parties, and presumably could issue verdicts on a majority basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not proven.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How would it be possible, with nine people running Scottish Homes, to ensure that they would cover the whole spread of the political and geographical spectrums? It is feared that with only nine people there will not be enough space to ensure that the legitimately involved interest groups are properly taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 60 speaks for itself. The argument involved is on the lines of that in amendment No. 32 and seeks that
	<span class='label label-info column'>306</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"members of Scottish Homes shall reflect the geographical and political nature of Scotland and shall include one representative from the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, one representative from the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations and one tenant from Scottish Homes."</p></blockquote>
People in south-east Scotland fear the potential for central belt domination of Scottish Homes, which would be bad. I hope that the Minister will accept the possibility. The amendment attempts to prove whether the Government perceive a problem and what remedies they have considered to ensure that the balance is maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 76 is important. I am less interested in the technical detail of its wording than in what the Government perceive as the legitimate role in Scottish Homes of tenants and the housing association movement. I hope that there will be some attempt to embrace the interests of both in the proper constitution of Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A major thrust of Government policy in establishing Scottish Homes has been to emphasise the great opportunities that it will provide for increasing tenant involvement in housing, and I hope that that is successful. It is also Government policy to develop housing associations, and the White Paper rightly acknowledges that both movements have a valuable contribution to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By setting up this body, the Government aim to increase the choices for people who wish to rent their homes. The Government have acknowledged the value of tenant involvement on a local scale, so it would be appropriate for them to carry through their commitment to tenant involvement and include a representative of tenants' interests in the membership of Scottish Homes. Otherwise, some people will suspect that the Government are paying only lip service to this important principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As an enabling and funding body, Scottish Homes will provide financial assistance to housing associations and housing co-operatives. It should be able to benefit from the experience of those already involved in the housing association movement through their representation in its membership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the interests of consumers and providers of housing should be represented in a body that is a particular plank in the Government's political philosophy and will have a major impact on the provision, availability and management of housing in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are important amendments. They need not detain the Committee as long as some of the earlier groups of amendments did, but if the Government are not prepared to accept the wording and technical detail of them, I hope that the Minister will assure us that the spirit behind them will be taken on board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Gentleman uses the word "consumer", does he mean "tenant"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I did not make that clear. It is part of the jargon nowadays. Everyone is interested in consumer interests, but in this context the hon. and learned Gentleman is right to pick me up. I am talking about tenant involvement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0248">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>307</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) for the spirit in which he moved his amendment, with which were grouped a number of others in the names of my hon. Friends and I. As the hon. Gentleman said, there is no need to spend a long time considering the amendments. The solution lies in the hands of the hon. member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) and we hope that the Committee can find a way out of its dilemma. However, if the hon. Member for Penrith and The Border wishes to keep his colleagues here for hours on end, that is a matter between him and them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire introduced a significant debate on the composition of the Scottish Homes board, which has enabled the Committee to explore the many detailed aspects of how the board will be constituted. Amendment No. 73 would require members of the board to
	<br><blockquote><p>"have their only or main residence in Scotland".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire referred to the Highlands and Islands Development Board, whose present Chairman—Mr. Robert Cowan—was recruited from Hong Kong. He was a merchant banker based in Hong Kong when the right hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger), the then Secretary of State for Scotland, was casting around trying to find a suitably Right-wing person with the proper commercial connections to appoint to the paid job of chairman of the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not criticise Mr. Cowan for a minute; indeed, I am fairly impressed by his approach to the job. However, his selection caused great offence in the Highlands and Islands area because it implied that there was no one resident there with the expertise, flair, talent, knowledge of the area and the ability to project its case. For some reason the right hon. Member for Ayr decided to go not just to another part of the United Kingdom, but to the farthest flung outposts of the empire to find a chairman for the HIDB.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman understand that the furthest flung outpost of the empire, as he chooses to call them, or all the world from Poland, Russia, the Balkans to the British Empire, were constantly saved by Scots because Scots did not have that damned silly parochial view? The Scots went out and did well in comparison with other people. You should not be so stupidly parochial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That sounds like a vicious attack on the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was built by England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know who built it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that I had made it clear that I have no criticism of the way in which Mr. Cowan is conducting the affairs of the HIDB.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>308</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend can understand, even if the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) cannot, the subtle difference between Scots setting out and playing an important role in world affairs and our own affairs being dictated by other nations. There is a profound difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We might find our way into an intriguing debate on the nature of the Scots personality. No doubt you will have noticed during your travels and your career, Mr. Lambie, that Scots love to go around the world and rule others, but seem content to allow their own country to be dominated by all sorts of weird minorities from goodness knows where. I have upset the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross again. However, there is no need to become bogged down in the nationalist aspect of the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire suggested a distinction between the sort of commercial flair required to operate the SDA and the HIDB—a largely commercial operation—and the business of managing housing provision in our country. I should be a little alarmed if the Minister followed the precedent of the HIDB and recruited a housing manager from Hong King, Shanghai or somewhere else to be in charge of Scottish homes. We might find ourselves with interesting variations on the types of architecture. We might not have the dampness problem but the density of housing development might increase.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We might even solve some of the overcrowding problems, if not the dampness problem, by developing a system of houseboats that could be situated on the Clyde, the Tay and the Forth. A person with proven expertise in the Chinese provinces would be of some value there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Junk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish that my hon. Friend would restrain himself from putting such ideas into the minds of Conservative Members. There are far too many precedents for what most people regard as totally crazy ideas being taken on board by that lot and imposed in legislation. How appropriate that the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) should be nodding his head and leering again. We all remember telling silly jokes about the possibility of a poll tax and about how no one would be daft enough to impose it in Scotland. But, guess what? We should have kept our mouths shut because the hon. Gentleman went back in the archives and read about the application of the medieval poll tax and thought that that suited his book perfectly. He then began leading his colleagues on and, hey presto, we are to have a poll tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for Hillhead will contain himself for a moment while I try to cajole the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross into understanding the distinction between managing people's home and managing commercial enterprises. The hon. and learned Gentleman spoke of Carnegie. One of the great sadnesses of my life is the fact that Christopher Columbus ever discovered America. Just think how much safer the world would be if the United States of America did not exist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the fact that we are discussing a very narrow amendment in a group. I know that he is easily led stray by both sides of the Committee but perhaps he will try to help the Chair by sticking to the narrow confines of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again, I am immensely grateful for your protection, Mr. Lambie. I shall address my remarks to amendment No. 73.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in Hong Kong talking about the Government having recruited a chairman for the HIDB from there, and more recently recruited another senior member of staff for the HIDB from the south of England, which undoubtedly caused offence in the highlands and islands. Nevertheless, I acknowledge that the individuals concerned might be the right people for the job, although I tend not to trust Conservative Ministers' judgment and I dislike the old patronage system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once again, I emphasise to the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross and other hon. Members that there is an important distinction between the management of commercial enterprises and the extremely sensitive local-parochial decisions, if he prefers that—that must be taken about housing in Scotland.

I plead seriously with the Minister, even if he cannot accept the amendment, to give a specific and clear assurance—not that we have had any assurance from him so far—that the Government intend to
	<span class='label label-info column'>310</span>
appoint Scottish residents who live in Scottish communities and come face to face with tenants and other Scottish residents in the course of their day-to-day life. Surely it is better to have people who are familiar with events in Scotland than individuals who might have to jet in for the occasional meeting at which they take high-level decisions.

Amendment No. 96 would amend section 4(1)(a) of schedule 1 to read 	<br><blockquote><p>"not less than 9 persons appointed…"</p></blockquote>

and the chief executive. I understand that the chief executive is to be a voting member of the board, so just 10 bodies would determine all the functions that we discussed very concisely on clause 1.

We have already discussed the range of responsibilities that the board of Scottish Homes will have. It will take over from the Scottish Special Housing Association.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the Committee suspended, I was trying to explain the rudiments of the decimal system to the hon. Member for Tayside, North. At any time of night, it could be a fairly forlorn task to try to introduce the hon. Gentleman to basic arithmetic. However, nine members of Scottish Homes is not a sufficient number properly to carry out the scale of work required. I suspect that Scottish Homes will divide into sub-committees to specialise in its various activities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that that was what the hon. Gentleman was getting at. Therefore, will he tell the Committee his views on the number of people who ran the British Empire throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is devastating stuff. I suppose it illustrates the direction that the present Conservative administration in Scotland wish to take. The figure "10" obviously has a special significance for Conservative Members—there are only 10 of them. Perhaps all 10 Conservative Scottish Members will form the board of Scottish Homes—[Hon. Members: "Not more than that."] Indeed, not more than. One would have to have a chief executive—perhaps it should be the hon. Member for Tayside, North. We realise that the hon. Gentleman is probably the last living Empire loyalist, and he may see some virtue in running housing in Scotland on the same basis as the British Empire was run. How many people currently serve on the board or committee of the Scottish Special Housing Association?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>312</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At present there are seven. The figure is not less than five and not more than seven.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take it that that figure includes the chairman or chief executive, or whatever he is called.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just "chairman".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So, seven members, including the chairman currently run the SSHA. In addition to the functions of the SSHA, it is intended that Scottish Homes will take over the functions of the Housing Corporation in Scotland. Will the Minister now tell us how many members of the managing body of that corporation come from Scotland? I suspect that there will be another three, four or five people whose jobs will be replaced.—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Has the Minister obtained some inspiration?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall answer when the hon. Gentleman has finished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the good-natured spirit that prevails in the Committee, I thought that we might be able to construct the argument as we went along. I imagine that three or four members of the Housing Corporation who are currently based in Scotland will form the sub-committee—in effect, the Housing Corporation in Scotland—which determines the Housing Corporation's policy on housing associations based in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So seven SSHA members and a certain number of Housing Corporation members will be replaced. But it is not as simple as that, because Scottish Homes will have a range of other functions which at present are carried out by either local authorities or the housing section of the Scottish Development Department. It is proposed, therefore, to place on the shoulders of a maximum of nine people—plus, of course, the chief executive—the burden of carrying out all the functions of Scottish Homes. They will takeover the work of 15 or 20 people. That worries me. Will it really be possible for the nine individuals on the board of Scottish Homes to be on top of the job that they are asked to do?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a parallel in the Scottish Office, which is manned by one Secretary of State, two Ministers of State and two Parliamentary Under-Secretaries. They have much to do, and they are supposed to be responsible for a mass of things. The hon. Member for Stirling is supposed to be responsible for the Health Service, education, sport and agriculture. Of course, Lord Sanderson of Bowden is the Minister with responsibility for agriculture, but the hon. Member for Stirling speaks on that subject in the Commons. The Minister of State, the hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Lang) is supposed to look after industry, local government finance, energy and other things. Then we have our old friend, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West, who is responsible for everything including the police, prisons, housing, transport, ancient monuments and I forget what else. [Her Majesty's: "Playgrounds"] Yes indeed; Pilton playgrounds.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0251">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>313</span>
However, I shall be charitable to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West. There must be some doubt whether he is on top of all the jobs for which he is supposed to be responsible. For instance, does he really know everything that is going on in the prison service in Scotland? Is he really taking the decisions on housing? He is supposed to be the housing supremo in Scotland, determining all aspects of housing policy, including housing expenditure and housing legislation, but look at him! He is sitting there, snowed under with notes from his advisers because he does not have a clue about this legislation, although he is supposed to be responsible for it. If this great Minister with his official car, his red boxes and all his glory is supposed to determine policy and decide on the thrust of the legislation, he is not putting on a very convincing performance. If that is what happens with the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West, how will the nine members of Scottish Homes keep on top of their job?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are disappointed that the hon.

He slightly sinks the argument that I would like to put; that if the ark had been built by a committee of nine, far less one of 15, all the animals would have drowned, and as we watch them all drowning, it is clear that one is not enough on this Committee. So the argument put by the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) about the numerical advantage of having more members rather than fewer members on a committee is puerile. I am absolutely certain, and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree, that if he were not here, those behind him would do a lot better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I have sought to suggest that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West is having difficulty mastering his brief on this legislation, never mind all the other things that he is meant to be doing.

to be responsible will not do the job at all, and that it will be done—dare I say it—by civil servants, officials and other people behind the scenes. That may be true, of course, of the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire. The reference that I was about to make to his election address is not long. I was fascinated by the fact that it made no reference to the Liberal party or even to the Social Democratic party, but made an oblique reference to something called
	<br><blockquote><p>"positive points from the Alliance programme",</p></blockquote>
if only we could find 13 of them. It is a strange party and the hon. Gentleman must try to represent it, although he is not here now. But he illustrates my point. To put all that responsibility—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I was speaking to amendment No. 96 about whether there should be more or less than nine members on the board of Scottish Homes. The hon. Member for Dumfries and the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross said that nine members or fewer could do the job adequately, but I have doubts about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a point similar to that made by the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross. It relates to a purely commercial operation, although I agree that it is an extremely efficient one. However, we are talking about a body that will deal with one of the most fundamental services that the people of Scotland require; the provision of good quality housing. That is not the same as a commercial operation, whatever its scale. It will have to take not only business decisions on matters of profit and loss—	<i>[Interruption.]</i>—I was sure that the hon. Member Stirling (Mr. Forsyth)
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0252">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>315</span>
said something, but perhaps he just opened his mouth and his tummy was rumbling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is surely a genuine distinction between the provider of local services to local communities, especially such a fundamental service as the provision of housing, and the operation of a commercial company. Members of the board will have to be accessible to individuals and their representatives from every part of the country. Tenants, tenants associations, community councils and district councils will want to have opportunities to consult and make representations to members of Scottish boards. The members will not be able to isolate themselves in an ivory tower and take purely commercial decisions. They will have to relate directly to their employees, the people who live in their houses and to others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 74 is still on the subject of numbers. It specifies that instead of a maximum of nine, a maximum figure of 15 should be set. It is not realistic to set up such an operation with fewer than nine people. However, as drafted, the legislation will allow the Secretary of State to appoint one person—perhaps he could get away with two—and say, "That is the board of Scottish Homes." I doubt whether that is an intelligent way in which to frame legislation. I do not understand why the Government are inviting the Committee to approve legislation that could result in such an absurdity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know what an appropriate number would be, but nine is too restrictive. That figure does not even replace the people who are now doing the job in the Housing Corporation in Scotland and in the SSHA, not to mention the other functions that will be taken on by Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 74, which was moved by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, introduces a requirement for not more than 15 members—perhaps that has something to do with the fact that that is the number required to form a rugby team, after all the hon. Gentleman represents a border constituency. However, 15 is a more realistic number.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 32 takes us into wider and more complicated territory. It requires the Secretary of State to appoint members of the board
	<br><blockquote><p>"representing all geographical areas of whom 7 persons are appointed by the Secretary of State, 1 by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and 1 representative of tenants' interests."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire made an important point about geographical areas. If we were to have a body with as few as nine members, appointed by the Secretary of State from the usual category from which he is prone to choose people for quangos, what will they know about the specific housing circumstances in parts of Scotland with which they are not familiar?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As one of the most respected Catholic Members of Parliament in Scotland, surely the hon. Gentleman must understand that there were only 12 disciples. They were not selected, they were chosen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>316</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Look what happened to the person who chose them! It is the first time that I have heard anybody compare the Secretary of State for Scotland with the Almighty. He may have such delusions—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or the first time that I have heard anyone compare the 10 Tory backwoodsmen to a more exalted group of individuals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am being led astray again by the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross. It is always nice to listen to lectures on theology from the hon. and learned Gentleman but perhaps he could make his own speech in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall return to the need for representation of the various geographical areas of Scotland on a board of this nature. There must be a risk that the Secretary of State would appoint a board of professionals, who may come from the professional classes in one of Scotland's major cities. No doubt they would be excellent accountants and perhaps well-qualified managers of businesses. But what guarantee is there that they will be conversant with housing circumstances in other parts of Scotland, whether it is the cities of Scotland, such as Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow or Edinburgh, or the rural areas and islands? The rural areas and islands have special problems and considerations that are peculiar to them. They are entitled to have specialist consideration by a body such as Scottish Homes. Schedule 1 does not provide for that, which is why we want a specific reference in the Bill to the geographical diversity of Scotland, be it urban, rural, island, mainland, east, west, north or south.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a case, for other direct representation, for instance, from the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. Because of the substantial overlap between the functions of local housing authorities and the functions of Scottish Homes, Scottish local authorities should be directly represented on the board. There are, of course, precedents for building into the constitutions of bodies of this nature a right to representation from other interested or involved organisations. The most obvious example that I can think of is that the chairman of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board is of right a member of the South of Scotland Electricity Board because of the overlapping responsibilities of the two bodies and the need to co-ordinate their operations. There is a similar case for direct representation from the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities on the board of Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then we come to the very important question of representation of tenants' interests. There is acute anxiety among tenants in Scotland, which has been well expressed by SSHA tenants. They cannot be fobbed off easily by the Government, who must give them proper assurances that tenants will be not only consulted but directly involved in decision-making in matters that affect the tenure of their houses and the management of their housing estates and neighbourhoods. It is imperative that tenants should be directly represented, so that their perspective on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0253">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>317</span>
the decisions taken by Scottish Homes can be properly taken into account at the highest level. It will not be good enough to go through the motions of consulting after decisions have been taken. Tenants should be directly involved and represented in the determination of their rents, in decisions about selling their housing estates to the private sector and in other important decisions relating to their neighbourhoods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 60 seeks to require the members of Scottish Homes to
	<br><blockquote><p>"reflect the geographical and political nature of Scotland and…include one representative from the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, one representative from the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations and one tenant from Scottish Homes."</p></blockquote>
That is a variation on amendment No. 32, but it also seeks to bring in direct representations from Scottish housing associations, which are an important aspect of the housing scene in Scotland. The present and previous Governments have strongly favoured the development of community-based housing associations and specialist housing associations which provide for the special needs of the elderly, the handicapped and other groups of people. If we are serious about continuing to support the principle of housing associations, there is a case for ensuring their direct representation on the board of Scottish Homes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the concept of representation.

The hon. and learned Gentleman described an absurd projection of the principle. Our amendments would impose a requirement of the Secretary of State to ensure that the board of Scottish Homes is reasonably representative. The Hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) may shake his head. He is currently going to great lengths to ensure that health boards in Scotland are not representative of those who use the NHS and that those boards are packed with members who have little interest in the operation of NHS. That is why health boards hand down some crazy decisions. It appears that some are agreeing to operate as the mouthpiece of the hon. Member for Stirling. Indeed, he issued an edict to the effect that the boards are required to do that—that they are agents for the Secretary of State. That summarises our fear about the board of Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>318</span>
It is not so unreasonable to impose a duty on the Secretary of State to ensure that Scottish Homes is reasonably representative and to specify categories of people who must, of right, be represented—especially tenants. If that provision were included in the Bill, it would at least ensure that if a Secretary of State flagrantly sought to pack Scottish Homes with unrepresentative members—and exclude categories of people who should be represented—it would be possible to challenge the board's composition. As drafted, the Bill does not provide for that and the Secretary of State for Scotland could simply put place men on the board of Scottish Homes. There are grounds for fearing that the current Secretary of State will do precisely that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 76 would ensure that the Secretary of State would
	<br><blockquote><p>"satisfy himself that the interests of tenants and the housing associations movement will be represented in the Membership of Scottish Homes".</p></blockquote>
I cannot emphasise enough the urgency and importance of tenant representation. The housing association movement in Scotland is also important. It has been based on the enthusiasm and motivation of communities and groups of people who are concerned about special needs groups, such as the elderly and the handicapped. No doubt anxiety exists about the impact of the legislation on housing associations in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One wonders whether the dedicated people who have put their energies into manning and operating those associations, into attending meetings, and so on—to provide a service to those who need it—will be so keen to continue their work if they are required to charge high rents and so undermine their tenants' security of tenure. That is what other provisions in the Bill will require them to do. There must be anxiety about the prospects of that movement in Scotland. Let us at least ensure that there is some provision for them to be directly represented, so that their interests can be taken into account in the deliberations of Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 107 would require the Secretary of State
	<br><blockquote><p>"to satisfy himself that each member will have a proven expertise in and commitment to housing in Scotland."</p></blockquote>
I suspect that the amendment was drafted shortly after the alarming press report speculating that Michael Ancram might be appointed to chair that outfit. I doubt whether he has any proven expertise in, let alone commitment to housing in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dumfries stressed the professional nature of housing management and the fact that Scottish Homes would be almost a commercial operation. We are not happy with that prospect. However, if Scottish Homes is to be a commercial operation, we must ensure that those who take the decisions have some professional expertise in and commitment to housing and housing management in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present there is no guarantee of any description in the Bill to ensure that the people nominated to the board know anything about housing. They will not even have to live in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about Woodstock?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He reminds me of that wee bird in the Snoopy cartoon, which is always running around but never says anything. The hon. Member for Penrith and The Border is the Woodstock of the Committee and he could be nominated as a member of Scottish Homes. However, as it may be an office of profit under the Crown, we might have a by-election.

We need people in the organisation who know and care about housing in Scotland, and there is no specific guarantee or provision to ensure that such people will be appointed. There must a genuine fear that Michael Ancram could end up as chairman of this lot. He is being canvassed by authoritative people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Another Catholic!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Member—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is a member of another family in the Borders that has converted to Catholicism and which also enjoys huge aristocratic benefits of large houses such as Paxton. The hon. Gentleman is the offspring of a conversion to Catholicism with a vast estate in southern Scotland, and so is the Earl of Ancram. Why do they reject all their inheritance? I do not see why they are jealous of each other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson), give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for East Lothian should answer the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) before he gives way to his hon. Friend for the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galloway).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Conscious as I am of the fact that you, Mr. Lambie, represent lodge No. nothing, Kilwinning, of the loyal orange order or the masonic order—I lose track of these things—or probably both, I hesitate to be enticed by the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross into a discussion on the Catholic families of The Borders, not that there are very many.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You will see, Mr. Lambie, why I expressed fear anxiety earlier about freedom of information with regard to Scottish Homes. The references to lodge No. nothing and so on struck you particularly close to home. I fear that the nine members of the board could all become part of a masonic conspiracy and conduct board meetings with their trouser legs rolled up. The incipient anti-
	<span class='label label-info column'>320</span>
catholicism rampant on the Conservative Benches shows that such accidents of appointment could well happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about Notre Dame?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support Notre Dame, as it happens.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am genuinely tempted to fuel the debate that hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross opens. It is a blessed relief that Gerry Malone and the Earl of Ancram are not here to follow his line of argument. But I had better return to the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 108 deals with paragraph 5(3) to Schedule 1, which reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may remove a member from office if he is satisfied that the member…(d) is otherwise unable or unfit to discharge the functions of a member, or is unsuitable to continue as a member."</p></blockquote>
Hitherto I have been suggesting qualifications that would render a person suitable to serve as a member of Scottish Homes. We invite the Minister to respond to our detailed suggestions for representatives of tenants, housing associations and geographical areas of Scotland, but the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"is unsuitable to continue as a member"</p></blockquote>
shows that the Government recognise that some people may not be suitable to serve as members of the board. If would be useful if the Minister could dwell on that aspect as it opens a range of possible arguments. The hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross may wish to be involved and say whether he wants Catholics, masons, tenants or even berry-pickers on or off the board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will give serious thought to the parlous route that his argument is taking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great difficulty with which we live in modern society is the fact that some people are intolerant of other individuals' political and religious beliefs. A combination of the two is fraught with problems. The hon. Gentleman should not want to travel down that route.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was very sonorous, but the hon. Member for Tayside, North has grasped the argument very well. The trouble is that that sort of consideration is in the Bill. It is a reference to someone being
	<br><blockquote><p>"unsuitable to continue as a member",</p></blockquote>
which must be a highly subjective judgment on the part of the Secretary of State. The hon. Member for Tayside, North shakes his head, but who is to say whether someone is unsuitable? I may think that the hon. Gentleman is unsuitable to serve anywhere, but nevertheless here he is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made it very clear in his off-the-cuff remarks that he considers me unsuitable for almost everything. I have long since ceased to take offence. The hon. Gentleman is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0255">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>321</span>
quite harmless. He is seen by most people as one of the idiosyncratic cranks that the aristocracy throw up from time to time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman should think seriously about what he is saying. People who are unsuitable are generally individuals who have transgressed and who have been proven guilty in the courts of some form of transgression. They would be most unsuitable to serve on such a body. That is one form of unsuitability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Flattery will get the hon. Gentleman almost anywhere. I am interested to hear that there is a legal definition of "unsuitable". I was not aware of it. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) will help us, or even the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross or the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West, who have experience as lawyers. I should have thought that "unsuitable" in this context was a highly subjective term. Under this provision it will be possible for the Secretary of State for Scotland to sack an individual whom he regards as "unsuitable" because he is less than 100 per cent. Tory, or words to that effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the first half of the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"is otherwise unable or unfit…to discharge the functions of a member".</p></blockquote>
I should have thought that they were legal terms. One can establish whether a person is "unable or unfit" to discharge the functions of a member because of ill health or commercial interests that he may have acquired in housing. That is a clear objective consideration. But "unsuitable" is not such a happy turn of phrase in this context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is getting into grave difficulty. There are many defined legal concepts of what is meant by "unsuitable" in statute. It is a term of art, not a matter of whether one happens to belong to the wrong sex or political party. Whatever term of art one uses, the cases demonstrate that the purpose of the term of the statute is to prevent people who are corrupt or insane. We should not reduce the argument to the stupidity of suggesting that the term of art, whichever English word one uses, is intended to allow people to make out that they judge others on political, sexual racist or other grounds. It is a term of art in law. If the hon. Gentleman can find a better one, he should do so. The cases are settled. It is not a question of saying that because he wears glasses or a red tie, goes to church on Sunday or belongs to this or that, he is not suitable. It is a term of art and could be changed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) for giving us the benefit of his advice. I still have some anxiety, because, as the schedule is drafted
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may remove a member from office if he is satisfied that that member—…is unsuitable to continue as a member."</p></blockquote>
I have some anxiety that it may be possible for an unscrupulous Secretary of State for Scotland—some of us would argue that we have such a Secretary of State at present—to exercise that power capriciously
	<span class='label label-info column'>322</span>
and unreasonably. There would be no way to prevent him. Can the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross advise us whether "unsuitable" in this context is necessary? The considerations that would have to be taken into account and to which the hon. and learned Gentleman referred—whether someone had been found guilty of fraud or was physically or mentally ill would be adequately covered by the remaining part of the sentence, namely,
	<br><blockquote><p>"is otherwise unable or unfit to discharge the functions of a member".</p></blockquote>
Is that not sufficient? Is it necessary to add "unsuitable"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly the point I was trying to make. "Unable or unfit" could be said of anyone for example, that someone was "unfit" because he was a member of the Labour party, because he was stupid, or because he was incapable of lighting a fire in the morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We could pose the question, "How can we get rid of a chap who oughtn't to be there by reason of what would be publicly judged his improprieties or his incapability to serve the office?" He may have become senile or dotty or gone abroad and not returned. We have to find a term to deal with that. It may be a general term but I trust, it will be interpreted, with responsibility. However, whatever term we choose does not alter the fact that we are saying that the Secretary of State must have the right to remove people from a board if they are not capable of carrying out their functions. That has nothing to do with political prejudice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am genuinely grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman for giving us the benefit of his wisdom and accumulated knowledge. He speaks with authority on the point. Nevertheless he will understand the anxiety in the minds of Opposition Members and those outside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To cite a further example, in the intervention that he has just made, the hon. and learned Genetleman said that the Secretary of State might have formed the view that it was imperative to get rid of a member of a board because he was "unsuitable".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the honourable and learned Gentleman. He said something that sounded like that. I can think of a specific example. Ted Matthews served for a short spell on Lothian health board. He served it well, representating a body of opinion in the Lothian area. He was well known to people in the Health Service and was a very conscientious and effective member. No one could criticise his conduct. However, possibly because of his political views people found ways to rubbish him. He was not reappointed and another faceless man was placed on the board. Because such events have occurred, in the recent past, we are anxious about such terminology being put into the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend has cited an example of capricious abuse of power in connection
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0256">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>323</span>
with "unsuitability". A more notorious example has been unfolding in the 	<i>Daily Express</i> and will continue tomorrow. I am referring to the removal of Mr. John Stalker, the then deputy chief constable of Greater Manchester, from a highly sensitive police inquiry. The man was getting too close to the truth—uncomfortably close for the Government and he was summarily dismissed. He was found suddenly to be "unsuitable".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that we are straying from the point. However, my hon. Friend made a fair point. I prefer not to read the 	<i>Daily Express;</i> I find it a distasteful newspaper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a very good newspaper and is especially well-written on Saturdays.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, on Saturdays. The point about Mr. Stalker is well taken. The Government decided that his findings would be inconvenient and embarrassing: "Let's get rid of him. Let's rubbish him." It is an example of the power of the Executive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not like to be personal in the Committee but the point was made by the hon. Member for Hillhead. If the positions had been reversed and we had been discussing these towns, might it be thought that he would be unsuitable for one reason or another?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us be clear. In legislation it is not easy to find words that cannot, for instance, be directed at the hon. Member for Hillhead, and to find a word that does not make a person who is pure under threat and a person who is impure unable to be excluded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not like the concept of quangos, patronage and nominated authority. That is why we would prefer the functions to remain in the hands of directly elected local authorities. That is the right approach. If we are to have quangos we want proper safeguards to ensure representation. People must see that they have the chance of a fair crack of the whip in decisions taken by the nominated authority. That is very important. We need assurances and a proper understanding so that a Secretary of State who nominates such a quango cannot act capriciously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We want an assurance that someone like Ted Matthews, who was appointed to Lothian health board with an excellent record of service and with the support of the churches in Edinburgh and the Edinburgh Council of Social Service—all non-political bodies—for the good work he was doing, will not be summarily removed simply because he asks embarrassing questions about cuts in Lothian health board, such questions being embarrassing to the accountants whom the Secretary of State has put in charge of the board and to the Secretary of State himself. We want an assurance that the Government will not simply put place men on
	<span class='label label-info column'>324</span>
Scottish Homes. We need people who, like Ted Matthews, might ask awkward questions, and champion the underdog—residents and tenants who might be affected by Scottish Homes. That is the sort of assurance we want, and the Government's record on that in Scotland is abysmal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cited the example of Ted Matthews and Lothian health board because it was a flagrant example of the Government abusing their powers of patronage and intervening to get rid of an effective and conscientious member of the health board because he asked questions that they did not want asked, let alone answered. Why go through the motions of nominating boards like this and giving them nominal duties to exercise discretion and make decisions if, whenever they do something that the Government do not like, members are sacked?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will realise that people appointed to a statutory body are normally appointed for a period of time. When and if they are prepared to serve another period, they make a fresh beginning. All Governments and local authorities, of whatever political complexion, regularly change people who have served for a period. Some will claim that the changes were made because of political views, but that is not always the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I draw the Committee's attention to the fact that that subject will be discussed under Amendment No. 75. We should not deal with it now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree. The hon. Member will soon discover that this quango is the exception. There is no time limit on the appointment of members of the board, so theoretically the Secretary of State could appoint someone for life. Similarly, he could dispense with the services of someone within days of appointing him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are placing a tremendous amount of power in the hands of the Secretary of State for Scotland. He has enough power already, but through this operation he will have even more and he will be even less accountable. That is why there is anxiety about the composition of the board and how it will conduct its affairs. The amendments have been moved in the hope of getting more information from the Minister and an assurance that the board of Scottish Homes will be representative and will be able to express the views of all the people interested in housing in Scotland. There is no assurance at present that that will happen. In the light of recent unhappy experiences with quangos under the auspices of the present minority administration in the Scottish Office we are right to express these fears.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) has dined rather well, but it would be foolish of him to swap insults with me. Unlike, I suspect, most members of the Committee I had the misfortune to have been given, as a Christmas present, the first volume of his autobiography. Knowing what I do from the book
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0257">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>325</span>
and, more importantly, knowing what I do from reading between the lines of the book, it would not be very fruitful for him or for the Committee to stand toe-to-toe with me—always assuming that, having dined so well, he is able to do so—swapping insults for the rest of the evening. We could continue all night, but I am keen to stick to the issues before us, which are issues of great moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Remaining with the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross, we had an amusing little exchange—it seems like hours ago, and I suppose that those of us who are forced to be here rather than those who choose to be here are saying, "Hear, hear" to that—on the issue of empire. My hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) described the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) as the last remaining empire loyalist. He was excepting, wrongly, the hon. and learned Member just to the right—in more senses than one—of the hon. Member for Tayside, North, from that, because we were then treated to a resume of some empire history. For two such leading—if one can use that term in such a shrinking constitutency—empire loyalists, they show a strange inability to grasp the difference, which is literally all the difference in the world, between Scots colonising other countries and other people and other countries colonising us. I hold no affection for that period of imperial history, although Members on the Government Benches do. I certainly take objection to my country being colonised and dominated by foreign interests. I include in that, for the purposes of this legislation, the English place men who have been stuck on to the Committee—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Racist!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it is not racist. The English place men who have been stuck on to the Committee, would not know a Scottish local authority house if they walked through the front door of one, yet they are nodding through, by eight votes to seven</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have just drifted in. A call of nature made me go to the toilet and I discovered that in the gentlemen's toilet opposite this Room a window has been left wide open. There is a fall of at least three floors to the ground. I notice that the hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot) is absent. I hope that does not mean that he had had enough of Scottish Homes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I was about to ask the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galloway), what his speech had to do with amendment No. 73. I shall certainly not allow any discussion on who has fallen from a window in the toilet. That is the job of the police, not of the Chairman. Will the hon. Gentleman get quickly to the point that he is trying to make on amendment No. 73 and the subsequent amendments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Lambie. Assuming that it is the job of the police, is it a job of police from Scotland Yard and, if so, can the hon. Member for Hillhead who has a history of being in Scotland for about one generation and little more,
	<span class='label label-info column'>326</span>
explain to us why the Metropolitan police officers would come from Scotland Yard? Conservative Members' families have lived in Scotland for 2,000 years while he has probably been there for one generation, and he cannot even tell us why the police who come from Scotland Yard are so called.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. and learned Gentleman knows that that is not a point of order. Again, I appeal to the hon. Member for Hillhead to inform me, as the Chairman, of the relevance of what he is saying to amendment No. 73. If he cannot do that, I shall have to rule him out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intend to make not one but many points on the amendments. In passing, I hope that you will permit me to say, Mr. Lambie, that we started off with the Earl of Ancram and the Catholic antecedents of my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion). We are now down to my Irish ancestry and it is not even 12 o'clock. I am not sure to what depths the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross will sink in his Protestant fervour during the evening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Candidly, it is strange to me why the amendment should prove exceptionable. It is obvious that a person who sits on the board of a body that deals with Scottish housing and will administer and have stewardship over about 100,000 Scottish homes should reside or have his main home in Scotland. It is not a draconian requirement to expect someone to have some stake. After all, is not the Conservative party's preoccupaton, nay obsession, with fostering home ownership all about people having a stake in the country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is floundering a little, so perhaps I can help him. In the last Parliament and for many Parliaments before, the hon. Member who represented Fife, Central was Willie Hamilton, who is sadly missed in this House. By no stretch of the imagination could one say that Willie Hamilton did not understand the problems of Scotland, yet it would be difficult to say that his main residence was in Scotland. I also suggest that other Labour Members who would prefer me not to mention their names do not have their main residences in Scotland; they, too, represent Scottish constituences and have considerable knowledge. Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that none of those individuals is suitable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am not saying that. There is a difference between someone who for five days and five nights, and sometimes through the night, is in London representing Scottish interests, and someone whose full-time job is to be a member of the board of Scottish Homes administering houses and housing stock in Scotland. It is not a draconian requirement. The alternative is a dragging of the net round the farthest-flung corners of what was once the Empire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in the exchange between my hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Tayside, North, about residences of members of the board. The headquarters of the

	<span class='label label-info column'>327</span>
board, like those of Guinness, need not necessarily be in Scotland. We have not yet even had an undertaking that the headquarters of Scottish Homes will be in Scotland. It might be down here. Perhaps my hon. Friend has tumbled into something important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fascinating possibility. Perhaps it will be offshore in a tax-efficient haven. That is possible, given the record of the Government. But it is possible that the net will be cast as far as the net for the vice-chairmanship of the Highlands and Islands Development Board. I confess to having been ignorant until earlier this evening that the Highlands and Islands Development Board vice-chairman was recruited from Hong Kong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am fascinated by the hon. Gentleman's nationalist concept. He is very concerned about Scottishism. Perhaps he will tell us the history of his family and how long it has been in Scotland, and perhaps he will tell us—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not in order and the hon. and learned Gentleman knows that. During a long sitting one must allow some laxity, but at the end of the day the business must continue according to precedence and the Standing Orders of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Lambie.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it a different point of order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it is different. The hon. Gentleman has used the word "draconian" twice. I am willing to bet you, Mr. Lambie, a button to a beanstick that he knows nothing about King Draco or the origin of the word or what it means.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman knows that that is not a point of order.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I knew that he was a Balkan King, but that is as far as I could have gone. As it happens, my family came to Scotland to be self-inflicted homeless in the Blairgowrie area picking berries.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am standing up for our national interests. Perhaps it is the time of night, but the Conservative Members seem to be failing to grasp the fundamental difference between our people going out there and giving it to them, and their people coming here and giving it to us, so to speak. The empire story was played out for some time. I suspect from your grimace, Mr. Lambie, that you are keen that I move off that, but it is interesting that the party which so loves, though it seems to misunderstand, the days of empire, is the one using the Gatling guns of Wanstead and Woodford—	<i>[hon. Members: "Woodstock."]</i>— and Penrith and The Border, to run this legislation through in the dead of night.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Dead of night?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be eventually. An amendment requiring the board members of Scottish Homes to have some kind of stake in Scotland can surely not be regarded as draconian, whatever that word might mean in classical usage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the classical usage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not rise to that question. In common usage, the amendment cannot be said to be draconian. The Government make much of the philosophy that owning a stake, bricks and mortar, in our country makes one a better citizen, more patriotic and more likely to vote for the status quo. In that case, it is surely not too severe a qualification that the people who are running 100,000 Scottish homes might be expected to own or at least occupy bricks and mortar in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other amendments are equally unexceptionable. Much has been made of the numbers issue, with many Biblical allusions. I am not qualified to comment on all those allusions, but nine plus the chief executive makes 10. That does not seem an auspicious number, when nine Tory Members of Parliament plus the chief executive—the Secretary of State for Scotland—are making such a damned awful job of running Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real issue is that if we have more members on the board, we shall be able to make it more representative. The hon. and learned member for Perth and Kinross had what he probably thought was great fun earlier with the hoary old myths about one lesbian, one homosexual, one Catholic—it is funny how the

	<span class='label label-info column'>329</span>
Catholics always seem to slip into his discourse— one Protestant, one ancient, one modern, one young, one old, one female, one male. There might even be one sober member of the board, or even one who knew something about Scottish housing. That would be useful representation. There is nothing wrong with trying to form a board which is representative, and there would be nothing wrong with a Scottish Homes board with a young person on it. Young people live in houses too, and have particular problems in housing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It was thought a good idea to have a committee in which there was one trade unionist, one employer, and one who was neutral. It was suggested that that would be a neutral board, but it is not. If there is one Celt and one Ranger, and somebody else, that is not a neutral board—it is a fanatical board. The idea that a child, an old-man, a one-legged man and a four legged-man are necessary is lunatic. All one wants is somebody who will take a decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, but we are inescapably interested in the kind of decision that the person takes. It is likely that a board which is representative of the people of Scotland will take better decisions than one which is unrepresentative. That should be common ground between us. In Scotland there are young people, old people, and despite clause 28 of the Local Government Bill, homosexual people. I do not share the disturbing obsession that Conservative Members showed when I mentioned clause 28 earlier. When they all shouted "Hear, hear!", I thought of Emerson's comment,
	<br><blockquote><p>"The louder he talked of his honour, the faster we counted our spoons."</p></blockquote>
but perhaps that is too deep for this time of night.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are all sorts of people in Scotland with housing needs and the right to a voice in Scottish Homes, but they will not get it through the Government's idea of proper scrutiny. We have already had the Gatling gun of Wanstead and Woodford—they will not get a voice that way. It may be a forlorn hope, but some effort might be made to give such people a voice through an enlarged board. We do not suggest extending it in the ridiculous way suggested by the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross. An extension from nine to 15 will not automatically allow every one-legged lesbian or black catholic a seat on the board, but it will allow scope for some effort towards making it representative. Most reasonable people would surely find that acceptable.
	<span class='label label-info column'>330</span>
Similarly, with the amendment dealing with geographical areas it should be self-evident that any board drawn exclusively from either the urban or the rural areas will be unbalanced. It is surely not beyond the wit of Conservative Members to see that simple fact. The Conservative party is almost totally bereft of electoral support in the urban areas of Scotland. They have few Members in those areas, and fewer councillors, and they will have fewer still in a few weeks' time. There is thus likely to be a bias against the inner cities and urban areas in the minds of the Minister and the Secretary of State who are to choose the nine people, so it is reasonable to write this into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who could seriously object to the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities having a place as of right on the board of Scottish Homes? We are repeatedly told that Scottish Homes will not be in competition with the local authorities, that it is no threat to them and is not out to cut their throats. If that is so, and in view of the bank of expertise and history that COSLA represents, why not give it an automatic place on the board? I should like to hear a reasoned argument why not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal states that some of the tenants of the 100,000 houses should have representation on the board. The Government do not think much of workers' or consumers' control, but surely they can find one seat on the board for a representative of the tenants. Much will be made of this during later stages of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One amendment asks that members of the board of Scottish Homes should have a record of proven expertise or interest in housing. In many Parliaments, at many point in history, the amendment would be seen as ludicrous. What Government would appoint nine members to a board, none of whom has a proven record of expertise or interest in housing? Only this Government would.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we do not write this amendment on to the face of the Bill, there is every chance that a board will be appointed that has no record of proven expertise and no interest in housing. The Committee is scrutinising the legislation—ha ha—and going through the Bill line by line—ha ha. It is comprised—I always get the English wrong because of my Irish background—or composed of individuals who have no interest in Scottish housing. They live a million miles, metaphorically, from Scottish housing and have not listened to a word of any of the debates through which they have sat. They are three-quarters through their library books, yet they are voting through Scottish housing legislation. A Government who are capable of doing that are capable of appointing anyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, a Government who were capable of appointing Sir Ian MacGregor to destroy the British coal industry are capable of making the kind of appointments that are being widely canvassed. The Earl of Ancram, Catholic or not, is one thing, but some of the names suggested as potential chairman of Scottish Homes are enough to make one's hair curl. There is even talk of causing byelections and enobling the hon. Member for Tayside, North and the hon.

The Government are obsessed with figures on balance sheets rather than with houses and homes.

I listened carefully to Opposition Members. I am deeply concerned at the Nationalist and racist undertones that have clearly emerged. Anyone who reads those speeches will not think that they come from a Parliament that has supported, with some distinction and credit in many cases, efforts to ensure that we do not take racist and Nationalist attitudes in the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the same hon. Member who last week made remarks about the berry pickers of Blairgowrie and who thrice this evening has drawn attention to my Irishness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When one is addressing someone who is putting forward fairly provocative points of view, it is not uncharitable or unrealistic to point out the flaws in his case or, more importantly, that he is standing on sand that is rapidly slipping away. If the hon. Gentleman persists in drawing attention to his Scottishness, Conservative Members are in order to point out that it may not be of a very great duration. As my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) properly pointed out, the suggestion that Conservative Members are less Scottish is nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members suggest that, somehow, we fail to understand the needs, aspirations, hopes and dreams of those who live in properties owned by the
	<span class='label label-info column'>332</span>
state or local authorities. That is also nonesense. Anyone who stands for election to the House, regardless of political party, must get support from people who live in that type of housing if he is to represent a Scottish constituency. Regardless of political party, all hon. Members have knowledge of and understand those who live in that type of house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, amendment No. 73 states
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall have their only or main residence in Scotland".</p></blockquote>
Hon. Members should consider that carefully. Does it suggest that if an hon. Member who represents a Scottish constituency, regardless of party, he were to retire from this place, he would be ineligible to serve on the board? I drew attention deliberately to Willie Hamilton, who retired honourably having served his party and the House with some distinction, although I did not agree with much of what he said. He applied himself well, and with some effect to the causes that he believed in. Under the amendment, on his retirement from the House he would have been excluded, as would other present generation Members of Parliament who represent Scottish seats and do not have their main residence in Scotland, from serving on the board. It would be wrong to name them, but Opposition Members know about whom I am talking about. They know the individuals who represent Scottish constituencies but do not have their main residences in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not suggesting that there is anything wrong with the history of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead because his direct connection with Scotland is fairly short term. However, it is the hon. Gentleman who wants to exclude certain people. Why should we exclude good people who can do the job effectively?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cited examples deliberately because they exposed the basic flaw in the amendment—that is, that it would exclude good people. That would be stupid, because the people whom I have named are, I believe, good people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that anyone who chooses to live outside Scotland thereby surrenders the right to serve on a board such as that of Scottish Homes? About 5 million people live in Scotland and most of them are good people. Surely it is not beyond the Government's capacity to pick from the 5 million resident Scots nine people of sufficient quality to man the Scottish Homes board?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a blue herring for the hon. Gentleman to talk about hon. Members who happen to live in London while they are serving in the House. That is not the issue. No hon. Member could expect to be on the Scottish board, because it is a full-time job being a Member of Parliament. If Government Members treated it as a full-time job, the House might be run better than it is now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

I return to the point that the hon. Member for Dundee, East was making. There are hon. Members representing Scottish constituencies who could retire of their own choice, if they were given and wished to accept the opportunity to serve on the board of Scottish Homes, when it is developed. The amendment would exclude those hon. Members. I have in mind an hon. Member who has wide experience of matters, but he would be excluded by the amendment. Let me make it clear that he is not a member of my party.—	<i>[Interruption.]</i>—The penny is dropping: hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I said that the hon. Gentleman was too far south in Scotland, that might help him. The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) will know who I am talking about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw attention to the matter only because I think that the amendment is not well-thought-out. I believe that the person whom I have in mind would make an excellent member of such a board. It would be madness to legislate so as to exclude people of that calibre. That reflects narrow, nationalist, racist thinking. If we say that we can choose anyone we want from the 5.5 million people who have permanent homes in Scotland, we exclude the many more Scots who live outside Scotland. We would be saying that we do not wish ever to use that marvellous pool of natural talent that is ours. The finest export we have is our people. They are our greatest asset. If the Committee believes that the amendment would not have damaging effects in the long term, it fails to realise that we would be excluding people of high calibre, who are Scots and very Scottish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with the points that the hon. Gentleman makes. Many millions of Scots have been driven into exile by some of the kindly lairds who were mentioned earlier, or— as we heard in the recent chart-topping record—by the succession of industrial closures in Scotland. Some of our finest people have been forced to leave our shores to find work to keep their families and themselves alive. There is a diaspora of Scottish talent which I would dearly hope could be attracted back to Scotland. I would dearly love us to have a society and an economy in Scotland that would attract it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cast no aspersions on anyone. We say that if a person is made a member of the Scottish Homes board he should buy himself a house in Scotland. That is not asking too much. We want him to set up residence in Scotland during his time on the board.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. and learned Friend for that intervention, but I am not qualified to say whether the hon. Member for Hillhead is mad. I leave the citizens of Hillhead to judge. I say only that the Hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for East Lothian have failed to grasp the significance of the amendment and how it could be used for nationalist and racist ends by people of the sort the hon. Member for East Lothian mentioned. Such people's judgment on selection would be so bad that they would use every tool at their disposal. If this proposed measure was accepted, it would be another lever of the type the hon. Gentleman mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that he wanted to speak to the amendment as drafted. Its effect would be that members of Scottish Homes would have their only or main residence in Scotland.

Surely that is not asking too much from people who will receive vast salaries and make important decisions affecting the lives of ordinary Scots.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is always a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Tayside, North(Mr. Walker), and this occasion is no exception. We have had many discussions about racial and religious discrimination, and the veiled threats to reveal names of members of the board who do not live in Scotland brings an unsavoury and tasteless edge to the debate. Perhaps we can concentrate on the subject matter of amendment No. 73.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is simple and straightforward. It merely requires members of the board to live above the shop; there is nothing wrong with that. All we ask is a commitment to the subject of Scottish homes. I see nothing objectionable in that and I do not see the basis for allegations of racism, the amendment says nothing about racial or ethnic origin. It proposes merely that the individual appointed must live in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we must also consider what is happening to Scotland at present, especially to Scottish industry. We have fears about what we expect will happen when the board is set up, given the Government's philosophy on housing, and I am worried about the sale of public housing stock. I do not object to anyone owning his home; everyone is entitled to that. But what will happen is not only sales to individual tenants or to the residents of a house for most of their adult life. We will also witness the possible wholesale transfer of housing stock—for example, into the hands of private landlords and speculators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have discussed the investment capacity of Scottish Homes and the fact that it will be able to invest in the same way as building societies if the Bill is enacted. That is what worries us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On reading the amendment, I scribbled down some names, including that of Britoil. Yesterday in the House, the Chancellor of the Exchequer almost washed his hands of Britoil, Scotland's largest company. Our concern is at seeing that company going down the tubes, because that is what will happen. In four or five years' time no one will have heard of Britoil; it will just be part of BP and thousands of jobs will go in the meantime. We are worried about the loss of jobs and of Scottish identity. That is not racist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought also about what will happen when the Scottish Transport Group is floated. Will control of that industry go from Scotland? That will be inevitable when shares are sold. I think especially of the electricity boards and the way in which they have been pumped up and primed for privatisation. The South of Scotland Electricity Board, one of the most modern and best-equipped in the country, offering an investor the attraction of generating and distribution capacity, will be divested of control, which will go
	<span class='label label-info column'>336</span>
outside Scotland. Its shares will be bought and sold on world markets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman's remarks. First, in talking about Britoil, did the hon. Gentleman realise that BP was a British company? Secondly, has the hon. Gentleman ever addressed his mind to the fact that many companies in Scotland have acquired companies outside, but retained their head offices in Scotland? For example, General Accident in Perth has many interests outside Scotland and, indeed, outside the United Kingdom. If such action is good and prosperous for General Accident and for Scotland, surely it must be right and proper for such action to work the other way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point. I am not on enemy of BP—I have had close contact with that company in my time. However, control of Britoil is moving away from Scotland to a multinational company and Scotland will lose its largest company. I also accept what the hon. Gentleman said about General Accident, because a company in my constituency, the Wood group, recently acquired American interests. I do not deny that there are such examples, but they are few and far between. However, there is a net outflow of assets from Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My concern is for Scottish housing, homelessness and the condition of housing. The amendment simply requires the board and the Secretary of State to lay down a minimum requirement for future members of that board. There is nothing untoward about that. The number of—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is good about 15 people that is not good about nine, eight, seven, 14 or 16? I do not understand the importance attached to the figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing special about any particular figure. However, we must look at the job the board will be required to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing two amendments. One requires a minimum of nine members and the other suggests 15 members. However, I am concerned about representation on that board. My city of Aberdeen, which is the third largest in the country, has a substantial number of homes that will become the responsibility of Scottish Homes. Many existing housing associations will be registered with, and answerable to, Scottish Homes and, quite simply, we want representation on that board. We do not want what we have to say determined in Edinburgh by the Secretary of State for Scotland or anyone else. I do not want to see control in the central belt or the regions—not only on a regional basis, because there are other interests—given in the way described by the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are housing interests that we want represented, and can speculate about the regional interests. However, I have no wish to see my regional interests in the north-east of Scotland and in the city of Aberdeen, in particular, not represented in some way on the board of Scottish Homes. The legislation does not point the Secretary of State in that direction. A purely arbitrary decision will be made by the Secretary of State. We heard in the remarks of my hon. Friends the Members for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths and for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) how, for example, the health boards were treated and how appointments were made there.

We take on board all the blandishments which the Government made when they presented the White Paper and the Bill to the Scottish public, the major blandishment being that tenants' rights and housing opportunities would be increased. However, in creating this large new quango, we must carefully consider the representation on its board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing magical about the number 15. The only connection—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is there anything logical about it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give all sorts of reasons why I think that it is logical, but the only connection is that 15 is the number of members on the board of the Housing Corporation in the United Kingdom.

I have never accepted the argument which I have often had to present as a lawyer that, because Scotland has a smaller population than England, it should receive proportionately less representation or public money in a particular area than England receives, or in this case, have proportionately fewer board members of a body similar to an English body. The Scottish Homes board has exactly the same job, albeit covering a smaller population, as the current board of the Housing Corporation in England, so I see no reason why it should not have the same number of members on its board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 32 is about the representation of local areas on the board, which is of course of particular interest to me. Areas such as my own in the city of Aberdeen already feel remote from Edinburgh. They feel very remote from London, but just as remote from Edinburgh. I do not see that the residents of Orkney and Shetland, the remoter parts of the highlands or parts of the borders would not have the same feeling, or why they should not be represented on a national body which has a national purpose. For that reason, I submit that the amendments, particularly Amendment No. 32, are appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 32, which stands in the name of our absent friend, the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood), seeks to cover the geographic and political aspect. I do not see why the Secretary of State should not have some direction as
	<span class='label label-info column'>338</span>
to the qualities that he should look for in the people for whose appointment to the board he will be responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then we come to tenants' representation. Slightly more than 100,000 houses will be owned by the new body, and one may double that number for the number of tenants, adding a few more for their offspring. Nearly a quarter of a million people will become resident in homes owned by Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many housing associations provide for tenant representation in their constitutions, and are run by their tenants. Langstane housing association in Aberdeen, for example, has tenant representation. It is seen as a justifiable exercise because it maintains contact with tenants and gives them a say in how the association is run and decisions about new projects, repairs, investment, rents and so on. There is nothing wrong with that. It is a sign of progress in housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not long ago, very few tenants in either the public or the private housing sector had any say in such matters. I do not criticise the present Government for that, because I think that my own party should have made tenant representation in housing associations possible a long time ago. I would not have gone so far as to sell the houses, but that is another matter. It was an important development of tenants' rights which should be extended into the board of Scottish Homes. As a large national corporation, it will play an important part in Scottish housing. It must have tenant representation if it is to reflect more than the current views of the Secretary of State for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members must realise that they will not always be the Government. My party has been in the same position as the present Conservative party, with a substantial majority and seeing itself as the natural party of Government. Conservative Members will not always be in control, and one day a Labour Secretary of State will make the appointments. Conservative Members should bear that in mind, but given the arguments which they put forward, I do not think that it will be long before they get their come-uppance. We can wait for that day, as Opposition Members are patient.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making a very responsible, serious and important speech. Whether he is right or wrong about his party forming a Government again is a matter of speculation, but I am interested in his argument that all people should be represented. How does he view the arithmetic and the responsibility for decisions? The fewer people who take decisions on a board, the more likely those decisions are to be right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us just have one, then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We may have that with the Secretary of State. There is a maximum of nine members on the board, but no minimum. I shall not speculate about the arithmetic, because I believe that the decision about that should be retained by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments seek to direct the Secretary of State to take into account considerations such as the geography of Scotland, the interests of tenants, and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0264">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>339</span>
a minimum representation of one tenant on the board. I see nothing wrong with that. Members of the board would represent interest, but they would have the responsibilities of any board member as set out in the constitution in schedule 1 as—we hope— amended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments seek to place a brake and some control on a Secretary of State in his appointment of board members. The matter must be considered very carefully. We cannot hand the powers over to the Secretary of State, saying: "Off you go, they are yours to exercise". I am looking ahead, not only to the present but to future Governments. I do so with some regret, because I believe that the bi-partisan approach under which, regardless of the party in power, it is sought in appointments to represent all the interests concerned, is being diluted. It is being abandoned in the health boards and in other areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should try to give some guidance to the Secretary of State. As Members of the House, regardless of what party we belong to, we have a responsibility to ensure that executive authority is not absolute, and that there are some fetters on it. It is not good enough to say that we can come back to the House and debate the matter after the event. It is important at this stage, when we are passing the legislation, that we take our duties seriously and ensure that there are proper checks, controls and balances in the legislation. That is what the amendments are about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise, Mr. Lamond, that your patience has been severely stretched by Conservative Members' unnecessary and irrelevant forays into antiquity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. I shall direct my comments, which I believe go to the heart of the Bill, to schedule 1(4)(a)—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—and to amendment No. 73, which concerns the composition of the board of Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that I caught the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State being passed a note by his principal civil servant, which I suspect contained a list of names perhaps the same list as that which the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) checked in the Conservative party document he was reading a few moments ago. At present, the short list probably contains the names of about 10 people who represent a variety of professions. Some of them are in work and some are not. One currently dabbles in journalism and legal affairs and one is a practising consultant, who has no medical qualifications. There is a financial adviser and a public relations consultant—the latter would probably be invaluable at selling some of the Bill's more unpalatable aspects. There is a chief executive of a flagging organisation and an expert on Gibraltar—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>340</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good old Albert.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That probably fits the real Bill—colonial experience, and so on. One person is a writer for a Sunday newspaper, which I understand has a declining circulation, there is someone who has returned to occasional farming and another consultant. The only person with a "real" job is currently working in a legal office and so is probably unavailable, that would take the number down to nine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before going over that possible list, I noted that the Clerk to the Committee consulted "Dod's Parliamentary Companion"—no doubt with an eye to spotting possible future appointees to the board should we delay the passage of the Bill and the setting up of Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will face a problem in finding people to serve on the board of Scottish Homes. The difficulty will not be a lack of willing volunteers—they managed to find people to serve on the various quangos referred to by my colleagues—but choosing people the general public regard as impartial. Recent experience shows that the general public have little confidence in similar boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would help to prevent Scottish Homes' board from being as unrepresentative as the Government's intention would otherwise make it. It is a matter of deep concern to the Opposition—as no doubt it is to nearly 100,000 tenants—that the Secretary of State for Scotland could place nine people, chosen without any guarantee of relevant experience, on the board of Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to increase the numbers on the board, so that at least one person might represent Scottish housing and its tenants. Even one such person would make a difference when compared with some of those appointed to health boards and other quangos. Fifteen members would be reasonable. Historically, it is an appropriate number in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested to hear the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross suggest that we should opt for 11 members on the Scottish Homes board—the number of members in a team in our national game of football. He will know that although the national football team has 11 members, it also has four members stripped and ready on the bench, waiting to come on to the field as substitutes. So, that would make a nice round number 15. Perhaps we should settle for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman's infinite wisdom and depth of knowledge on these matters, together with the articulate manner in which he puts them across with a slight sting in the tail, never ceases to amaze me.

We find it quite shocking that the Government are not prepared to accept even one tenant on the Scottish Homes board. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that they have not allowed tenants to have a ballot. They insist on ballots when they suspect that the results may embarrass their enemies, or when even calling for a ballot may do so. However, they are not so anxious to support a ballot that would establish whether people want something. We have discovered that in our debates on other amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is to be a ballot, we hope that the board will have at least one tenants' representative. It goes amiss to appoint a member of the housing profession —someone who has day-to-day, if not year-to-year, knowledge and a depth of experience in housing. Such a person should have a place on the board as of right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>342</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a fair point. He will know that there are no tenants' representatives on the board of the Housing Corporation, although that board has 15 members. Nor is there a representative of housing professionals on that board. It is interesting that its chairman is a former lord mayor of Westminster. That takes on a sinister significance when we remember that the hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot) was dragooned on to this Committee. Could it be that he has been earmarked as future chairman of the Scottish Homes board?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I knew that "Dod's Parliamentary Companion" would come in handy. No doubt that is what the Committee Clerk was consulting.

I have had dealings with the Housing Corporation on behalf of tenants, home owners and residents of a number of housing associations in Edinburgh who felt that they were not represented on the Housing Corporation. My dealings with the Housing Corporation followed a complaint that there had been a shift in resources in Scotland away from Edinburgh and the east. I had to speak for the residents who at present do not have a voice, and they welcomed my intervention. However, I was reluctant to speak for so many home owners and residents who were well able to speak articulately on their own behalf. Our dialogue ensured that the balance in the allocation of resources was redressed this year. Just as the Minister responsible for housing got his play area, I managed to help in securing the shift of millions of pounds of additional resources into the city that I love and represent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not suprised to hear that my hon. Friend got a fair hearing from the Housing Corporation's Scottish Committee, because it is chaired by John Richards, who is a constituent of mine. Not only do we have the chairman of the Housing Corporation's Scottish committee living in the Lothian region and East Lothian district, but the Minister with responsibility for housing, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton). Therefore, my hon. Friend should be able to make headway on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
