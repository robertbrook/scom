	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to give notice that on Tuesday next it will be my intention to move,
	<br><q><p>That during the remaining proceedings on the Housing (Scotland) Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half past Four o'clock.</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Mr. Canavan, I made a ruling on Tuesday and unfortunately you would not comply with it then. I must ask you to leave the proceedings. [	<i>Interruption].</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. When we tried to commence our sitting on Tuesday, I was about to refer to the unprecedented declaration of interest in the Bill of the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton). On Second Reading on 11 January, he referred to his interest in a company which could be affected by the Bill—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not a matter for me to consider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that, Mr. Martin, but it would be useful for the Committee and for people in Scotland if the Minister could clarify that issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It may be useful to the hon. Member, but it is not a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Attention has been drawn on the Floor of the House to the declaration of interest that I made at the beginning of my speech on Second Reading. It may facilitate the Committee's proceedings if I give an account of the matter to which my declaration related.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I drew attention to my entry in the Register of Members Interests which shows under "declarable shareholders" the words:
	<br><q><p>"Hamilton and Kinneil Estates Limited (believed to be approximately 1 per cent.) (or a minority shareholding in one of its successor companies)".</p></q>
Those successor companies have recently been created and I have an interest in one of them. The purpose of this company is to handle part of the assets of a trust set up by my father. I am not a director of the company, nor a shareholder in it, but I am a beneficiary under the trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill, if enacted, could have an effect, as the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
company's assets include two domestic properties which are now tenanted. One is a tenancy that is secure as long as the tenant wishes and the other is a tenancy for life. If either of those tenancies were to come to an end, in years to come—however remote a future tenancy could be an assured tenancy under the Bill. I am sure that hon. Members will accept that that interest is remote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be helpful if I read out the terms of a letter from the Registrar of Members' Interests and make that letter available. The letter from Mr. Hastings, dated 19 January 1988, states:
	<br><q><p>"You asked for clarification on one point which we have discussed on previous occasions in connection with your declaration of interests in the Register.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>The issue of declaration of interest in relation to a particular item of business arising in the House is distinct from the requirements of the Register in that it is governed not only by long established practice of the House but by the Resolution of the House of 22 May, 1974 which requires that in any debate or proceeding of the House or its committees a Member shall disclose any relevant pecuniary interest or benefit of whatever nature, whether direct or indirect, that he may have had, may have or may be expecting to have. The scope of the Resolution is therefore wide and I suspect that its terms are not always as fully recalled by Members as they might be and are probably not always observed. In the terms of that Resolution you very properly made a declaration of interest on the second reading of the Housing (Scotland) Bill even though the interest which you had particularly in mind which might be affected by the provisions of the Bill was a limited one. In think it is a matter for you whether you wish to repeat, or explain, that declaration when the Standing Committee meets."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Will you give the Committee guidance on the timing of declarations of interest? I understood that it was wrong to declare an interest or to raise matters relating to declarations of interest before the sittings motion was passed. As you will recall. Mr. Martin, that matter was raised by the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) during the last session of the last Parliament in the proceedings of the Standing Committee on the Licensing Amendment Bill. He upheld the Chairman's ruling that declarations of interest must be made after the sittings motion and before the substantive business of the Committee. If hon. Members wish to make a declaration of interest, they must wait until after the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Declarations of interest should be reported to the Registrar and it is not for me to consider them. However, as the Minister raised the matter on a point of order, I allowed him to explain his position. He has satisfied me and, I hope, all members of the Committee that he has conducted himself in an exemplary manner. I do not wish to have any further points of order on the matter. The Registrar of Members' Interests is a matter for hon. Members to take up with the Registrar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. The point of order about the Minister's interests was raised by the Opposition spokesman, the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson), who also has interests. He is a laird and he lets homes—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not want to repeat myself, but I have already said that this is not a matter for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0085">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>"That during the proceedings of the Housing (Scotland) Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister took us by surprise there. I understood that an assurance had been given that the initial sittings motion would provide for morning sittings only. That is why I was slow on the uptake and I apologise humbly and sincerely to you, Mr. Martin. The sittings motion is not conducive to constructive or speedy consideration of the Bill. The Government may find that they make slower progress than they might have hoped and than we might have allowed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the point about declarations of interest, which is related to the sittings motion because it could arise on either Tuesdays or Thursdays, be it in the morning or in the afternoon. The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) said that I had an interest in the matters dealt with by the Bill. That is true, and I declared it on Second Reading. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Tayside, North appears to be going berserk. Does he have a problem? Would he like me to give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is astonishing that the hon. Gentleman thinks that his declaration is in order, and we do not want the details, while at the same time he is questioning my hon. Friend the Minister, who made the same declaration. What is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are discussing the sittings motion. Declarations of interest have been dealt with and should not be referred to during a sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As an aspersion has been cast, I must say to the hon. Member for Tayside, North that there is a distinction between an interest declared by an Opposition Member or a Back Bencher and an interest declared by a Minister. I refer him to a minute on Cabinet procedure, a copy of which I can let him have. There is also a slight distinction between someone who is supporting and advancing a piece of legislation which will extend his interests and someone, like myself, who is opposing such legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We already have a point of order, but the hon. Member is quite right, I can take a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. We are spending a lot of time talking about declarations of people with an interest in Scottish housing. I want to discuss the lack of interest in Scottish housing by Conservative Members. That is the important issue. The Secretary of State for Scotland, whose seat is eloquently empty, and his English colleagues have no interest in Scottish housing whatever.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall have ample opportunity to discuss that subject in a minute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sittings motion provides for meetings of the Committee on Tuesday and Thursday mornings from now until eternity. Will the Minister clarify whether that refers to this Thursday afternoon, or whether the sittings motion will take effect from next week?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under the rules of procedure the sittings motion cannot apply to this afternoon because inadequate notice has been given, so it obviously refers to next week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us be thankful for small mercies. As my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galloway) suggests, I shall move on from the possibly irregular interest of one member of the Committee to the spectacular lack of interest of other members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, West (Mr. Canavan) has highlighted the fact that several elected Scottish Members of Parliament have been kept off this Committee and will not be able to consider this Bill either on Tuesdays or Thursdays, whether in the morning or in the afternoon. My hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, West is not alone in finding the Government's attitude towards the conduct and consideration of the Bill somewhat provocative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sittings motion gives us an opportunity to discuss the timetable for the Committee's consideration of the Bill. We require a timetable that will suit not only the Members appointed to the Committee by the House, but other Members of Parliament, especially Scottish Members who might want to discuss the afffairs of their constituencies with their colleagues on this Committee and other interested organisations in Scotland, such as local authorities. The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities was here yesterday and could have discussed these matters with members of the Committee, but no Conservative Members took that opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other organisations in Scotland, such as housing associations, housing co-operatives, tenants' organisations, and organisations such as Shelter, may want to advise members of the Committee, but the sittings motion will present difficulties for them. Some hon. Members would benefit more than others from advice on Scottish housing from people based in Scotland. Will the sittings motion provide a suitable framework and timetable to allow hon. Members to take advantage of such excellent advice?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Select Committee on Selection has given us a problem by its composition of the Committee. Seventy-two Members of Parliament are elected from Scottish constituencies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. What the Select Committee on Selection gets up to is no worry of mine. The hon. Member should stick to the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise that, and this is related to the sittings motion because the background to the Committee's composition. It creates problems for some of its members for different reasons and in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0086">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
different ways. My hon. Friends may find it inconvenient to attend Committee sittings on, for example Tuesdays. It is abundantly clear that at least one Conservative Member will find it difficult to attend Committee sittings on Thursday mornings, because there are Cabinet meetings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said 72 Members of Parliament are directly elected from Scottish constituencies and represent Labour, the Liberals, the SDP and even some Conservatives. The vast majority of those hon. Members have shown a direct interest in the housing conditions of their constituents. Many have shown their active interest in the Bill. I refer, particularly to the hon. Members for Glasgow, Pollock (Mr. Dunnachie), for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall), for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe), for Falkirk, East (Mr. Ewing), for Falkirk, West for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson), for Hamilton,(Mr. Robertson), for Strathkelvin and Beasden (Mr, Galbraith), and for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling) and the right hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Millan). Those right hon. and learned Members all either intervened or made speeches on Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, some Committee Members did not show such a keen interest on Second Reading. The hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) did not even vote, yet I gather that he is a member of the Committee. I cannot see him, perhaps he is under the table. We have several hon. Members on the Committee who are likely to find the sittings motion extremely unsatisfactory. It is only fair that the Committee should dwell on the problems facing those hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For reasons best known to the Government Whips, the Select Committee on Selection has given 61 per cent of the seats on the Committee to a party which managed to win only 14 per cent. of the Scottish constituencies at the election—10 out of 72. That must be particularly galling for the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) because he is described as the representative of the minority parties on the Committee. The so-called minority parties have more seats than the Conservative party in Scotland, yet the hon. Gentleman is outnumbered 11 to one. No doubt he will want to comment on the sittings motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mysteriously, we have nine of Scotland's 10 Conservative Members and two foreigners—I put it no stronger than that at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Adam Ingram 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Kilbride)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says that we have nine Conservative Members with us, but the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) is not here. I understand that the hon. Member is attending a murder trial. Does my hon. Friend agree that it would be better if the hon Gentleman were here, watching the Government's murder of Scottish housing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is fascinating to hear why the hon and learned Member for Perth and Kinross is absent. Is he in learned counsel at the trial? Is he the defendant? Perhaps he is the corpse! It would have been nice if the whole contingent of 10 Conservative
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
Members were on the Committee, including the Secretary of State for Defence, complete with his nuclear button. Then, if he became appalled by the speeches made by the hon. Member for Tayside, North, he would have the ultimate deterrent. He could self-destruct and destroy everyone else at the same time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The contingent that we have contains several hon. Members who have made it clear that they do not want to sit on Scottish Committees on Tuesdays, Thursdays, or on any other day. It is odd that the hon. Members for Tayside, North, for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) and for Perth and Kinross can manoeuvre themselves out of the Scottish Select Committee on Scottish Affairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Allen Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a disgraceful comment and the hon. Gentleman knows it. Although my hon. Friend and I have reservations about the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs we have made it absolutely clear that we are not only able, but delighted, to serve on every Scottish Standing Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Frankly, I find that less than convincing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me be convincing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That will take time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While the hon. Gentleman never sounds convincing because he lacks the ability to believe in most of what he does—his background and everything else is a contradiction of what he comes to this place to say—[Hon. Members: "You were a bus conductor."] My background is not a contradiction. I believe in free enterprise and the capitalist system. It does better than anything or anyone else. I do not come here to destroy it, or will I be party to skulduggery from wherever it comes and if it comes from within the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs, I shall not accept it. That is why I made my position clear in a speech on the Floor of the House. It is on the record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) doubted my sincerity and my belief in what I do, I hope that I have answered him clearly. I am happy to serve on every Scottish Standing Committee and on as many Scottish Committees dealing with United Kingdom legislation as it is possible to serve on. Indeed, I go further and say that my record on Standing Committees is better than that of the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is always difficult to follow the hon. Member for Tayside, North. He and I have one thing in common: we are both class traitors. However, I come from a class that is more deserving of betrayal than the class that the hon. Gentleman comes from.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman and some of his hon. Friends have managed to manoeuvre themselves out of serving on the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs on Tuesdays and Thursdays, or any other day, thereby sabotaging that Committee. They now find
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0087">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
themselves dragooned into attending this First Scottish Standing Committee. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for intervening at this stage. I enjoyed the memorable speech that he made on the Floor of the House about the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs, but if he wants to shirk his responsibility and is not willing to serve the Scottish people, many of my hon. Friends who represent Scottish constituencies will be happy to take his place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What of the self-important people who purport to be Ministers on the strength of less than a quarter of the votes cast in Scotland last year? Apparently that is a sick joke that will be resolved in due course by the establishment of a Scottish assembly to deal with Scottish legislation on domestic affairs, such as housing. The right hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind), who thinks that he is the Secretary of State for Scotland, is not here today, but I should be happy if he were prepared to apply his mind entirely to the consideration of the Bill on Tuesdays and Thursday mornings and afternoons, so that we can have a proper debate and he could exercise his vote in line with the advice that he receives from people in Scotland. But where is he? Possibly Thursday morning does not suit the right hon. and learned Gentleman. I presume that he is attending a meeting of the Cabinet and is rolling over and purring, and that when the Prime Minister says, "Cut Scotland's budget", he replies, "By how much?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about the Minister of State, Scottish Office and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth)? We should be delighted if they were to apply their minds to Scotland's housing crisis on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but I suspect that they, like their right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland, will be only nominal members of the Committee. They will continue to apply their energy to the poll tax and to privatisation, while they leave it to their English surrogates to maintain the Government's majority on this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the extraordinary misfortune of the hon. Members for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot) and for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean). The hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford was candid enough to tell the press last week that he had not volunteered to serve on the Committee. Indeed, last Thursday he voted in accordance with his party's three-line Whip to help defeat the Protection of Official Information Bill which was proposed by his hon. Friend the Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd). I am surprised that that did not earn him enough Brownie points to be spared this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is straying from the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise most humbly, Mr. Martin. I was about to suggest that there may be a case for making special arrangements with the Fees Office so that the hon. Members for Wanstead and Woodford and for Penrith and The Border can make a brief excursion to Scotland. They may like to go next Tuesday morning, when many of my hon.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
Friends would be delighted to take them on a conducted tour of housing estates. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire could show them housing in Hawick and in other parts of his consitituency, and I would be delighted to take them to Prestonpans, where Englishmen have come to grief in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Penrith and The Border will have at least been to Scotland but, like other ambitious Scottish Tories, he was wise enough to scuttle over the border as quickly as possible after a brief excursion in the constituency of Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber in 1983.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To be serious, neither hon. Gentleman has any direct, or indeed indirect, interest in the Bill; none of their constituents will be affected by any part of it. Yet they will be asked to spend their Tuesdays and Thursdays considering specifically Scottish housing legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford is the first English Member of Parliament to be appointed to a Scottish Standing Committee on a major Bill concerning Scotland since 1962. That just falls within the Standing Orders, because there are 16 Scots nominally on the Committee. However, as I said, I suspect that the Ministers are here in name only. Nevertheless, it is an abuse and an unwelcome revival of a practice that is offensive to the principles of democracy in Scotland. It is not even necessary, because the Government could have maintained control of the Committee, within the terms of the Standing Order, by having a Committee of 16 Members, composed of nine Conservatives, six Labour Members and one Liberal. But they have chosen to bring two English extras as Lobby fodder to allow Ministers to skulk off to Dover house and to get on with their dirty work in the Scottish Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are treating the hon. Members for Wandstead and Woodford and for Penrith and The Border with contempt and, worse, they are treating Scotland with contempt yet again. That emphasises the overwhelming case for democratic devolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the sittings motion. If the hon. Members for Wanstead and Woodford and for Penrith and The Border are to treat their membership of the Committee seriously, they must take a crash course in Scottish housing, because they will be required to make hasty decisions on detailed aspects of housing management and legislation in a faraway land about which they know little.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sadly, neither hon. Member, nor any other Conservative Member on this Committee, took advantage of the opportunity accorded to them yesterday by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities to meet councillors from the islands, urban, or rural councils throughout Scotland. No Conservative Member took the opportunity to discuss housing matters with elected Scottish councillors when COSLA held a full meeting in Westminster yesterday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I heard the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) protesting on Radio Scotland on Monday that COSLA was coming here. He said that it was unnecessary for its members to come here to talk to their Members of Parliament because they could go to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0088">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
weekend surgeries. It would serve the hon. Gentleman right if there were a plenary session of COSLA in his surgery in Eastwood this Saturday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be suggested that the hon. Gentleman made a fair debating point, but that overlooks the presence on the Committee of the hon. Members for Wanstead and Woodford and for Penrith and The Border. How can Scottish councillors attend constituency surgeries in Wanstead, Woodford, Penrith, or anywhere else in Cumberland to make representations to those two hon. Members about specifically Scottish housing legislation? If decisions affecting Scotland are taken here, people representing Scotland can make their views known to the decision-makers only by coming here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be useful if the hon. Members for Wanstead and Woodford and for Penrith and The Border could spend a week or two, before we start considering the nitty-gritty of the Bill, studying Scottish housing issues. If they will be voting on matters that affect my constituents, but do not affect any of their constituents, the least that they could do would be to visit Scotland and learn the terminology that we shall be using. We could have an exam at the end of their course. Perhaps the hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford could tell us what the letters, "SSHA", stand for?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is not listening—he is stuffing envelopes again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nothing out of 10 so far. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman could list the new towns in Scotland, where many houses will be affected directly by the proposed legislation? Can he tell us the names of the new town development corporations in Scotland? Perhaps the hon. Member for Penrith and The Border can assist?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps you can help us, Mr. Martin?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can help by saying that that has nothing to do with the motion before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, Mr. Martin, but it illustrates the need to defer further consideration of the Bill to give those two hon. Members an opportunity to spend at least next Tuesday and perhaps even the following Thursday, learning the basics about housing in Scotland. Perhaps the hon. Members can answer a simpler question and tell us the names of the Conservative-controlled local authorities in Scotland? That would not take long as there are only four. However, I do not suppose that they even know that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am genuinely anxious about the prospects of the hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford, who was only elected to Parliament last June. He will have much work to do in his constituency and I wonder what his constituents will think about him spending his Tuesdays and Thursdays dealing with legislation
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
that has no bearing on them. Did his constituents realise that he had a burning interest in Scottish affairs and would devote so much time to dealing with such legislation when they voted for him at the general election? They should be told and it may be useful to ask the Wanstead and Woodford Labour party to make inquiries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That has been done and I understand that the Wanstead and Woodford Labour party is currently preparing a leaflet to that effect for distribution throughout the constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford should give us a leaflet on Scottish housing, which we can circulate among our constituents to satisfy them that he is qualified to spend his Tuesdays and Thursdays discussing their houses. He has probably not even seen one, let alone been in one. I am sorry for the hon. Gentleman. He will have a rough time in this Committee. Somebody should have told him that before he was dragooned into it. I read up on his pedigree and experience in political and other affairs be it in Wanstead, Woodford, Cynon Valley, Kent or, indeed, Kensington and Chelsea. He is described in 	<i>Parliamentary Profiles</i> as an
	<br><q><p>"acrobatic flyer at Biggin Hill".</p></q>
I fear that we have a metropolitan equivalent to the hon. Member for Tayside, North in our midst. I see that the hon. Gentleman has taken his specs off. Does that mean that I can hit him?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to be reasonable in the consideration of the Bill and we want full and proper debates about housing in Scotland. It is high time that we had such debates about homelessness, bad and overcrowded housing, long waiting lists for homes, rents and other burning issues which affect our Scottish constituencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government could easily set a timetable for the full and adequate consideration of the Bill, which would still enable it to be out of the House of Commons before the Easter recess. That would leave plenty of time for consideration of the Bill in the House of Lords. I do not want to rub salt into the wounds of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, but I believe that the Scottish education Bill will be less than controversial than was once feared. Not only has the ceiling fallen in, but the floor appears to have collapsed too, so we may be able to deal with that Bill more quickly than he had hoped. There should be no hury to push this Bill through Committee stage. If the Government want to provide for proper debate, there is time for us to obtain proper advice and hold a constructive debate on housing issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far, the Government's conduct has been unnecessarily provocative and has not been conducive to constructive consideration of this fairly controversial Bill, which affects thousands of tenants and householders in Scotland. Sooner or later, the Secretary of State will have to begin to compromise with the Scottish electorate. For the sake of the people of Scotland and the unity of the United Kingdom, I hope that it will be sooner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am beginning to get anxious about the turn of events. The demonstration yesterday was properly motivated, but we lost time. The Government's counter-reaction was to slap down an afternoon sittings motion earlier in the proceedings than I have ever experienced in Committee. If we are beginning a war of attrition that will lead to a filibuster, and that will not be in the best long-term interests of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman, but during the Committee stage of the Abolition of Domestic Rates Etc. (Scotland) Act 1987 in the previous Session, the Government introduced morning and afternoon sittings on the first day. The Government's present conduct is not unprecedented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That intervention from my constituent the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) serves only to reinforce my argument. I am not being sanctimonious, but there are Bills where Opposition Members have no alternative but to wade into the argument with Wellington boots.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Tackety boots.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some Bills do require tackety boots or Wellington boots or a combination of both. The Opposition then have no alternative but to filibuster. Had I been a member of the Committee dealing with the Bill to which the hon. Member referred I would have wanted to take it right to the limit and take it through the night every night. But this is not such a Bill. If one takes tackety boots to every Bill one will begin to lose the wood for the trees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important Bill in political terms but I do not think that it is controversial in party-political terms. There are issues and there will be differences which will divide the Committee. However, I fervently hope that we will organise the Committee's timetable sensibly. That is not just in our interests, but in the interests of those who follow these arguments and who have expertise on housing in Scotland. A sensible and ordered progression through the Bill is in everyone's interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say that too because I expressed doubts, as did the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) in his sensible and helpful speech, about the consultation that took place before the Bill reached its Committee stage. Some of the consultation papers were put out immediately after the general election and some before the election. The consultation process only finished after the Bill had had its Second Reading. It is fairly scandalous for the Government to have done that and to have put the Committee in this position. The interest groups in Scotland still have questions that need to be answered and clarified. Their only real opportunity to get clarification is to assist the work of this Committee as it flushes out and then fleshes out the Government's plans for some of the details of the Bill. That is another reason why an orderly and sensible progress is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my contribution to the sittings motion will be accepted as a plea for some self-restraint and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
discipline from members of the Committee. I shall certainly apply that to myself as far as I can. This is now the most important Bill that any Scottish Standing Committee will consider this Session. I take that view after the recent changes which the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Science announced this week about the Scottish education Bill. If the ceiling powers had remained in that Bill it would have become the most important and controversial Bill this Session. I have now changed my view about that. I am pleased that he made that announcement, but it makes this Bill that much more important. The Bill is much larger than the Scottish education Bill, even with ceilings and floors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has no windows anyway.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No light is ever shed on the subject. By any parliamentary standards 67 clauses and 10 schedules is a major Bill. Even if it were sweetness and light from start to finish which it obviously is not, it would still be necessary to do justice to such a lengthy Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tell the Government, and indirectly the hon. Member for East Lothian, that I am anxious to try to devote the majority of Committee hours available to Scottish Standing Committees in this Session to this Bill. I am not really part of this argument because it is conducted through the usual channels; I am consigned to the nether regions of minority parties. I would be willing to exercise self-discipline and restraint on any subsequent Bills so that we can spend the majority of our time on this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the hon. Gentleman's comments. However, were not he and the hon. Member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram) informed through the usual channels that the motion would be moved this morning?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot remember, but I think that we probably were. I am not objecting to the sittings motion. I am willing to go along with the Minister's suggestion that we meet regularly on Tuesdays and Thursdays, subject to the important qualification that Thursday evening's sitting stops long before the sleeper timetable starts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is OK for the hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman can get home for his dinner between the morning and afternoon sittings, which is more than the rest of us can do. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I mean his lunch. I should not like Conservative Members to be confused about the difference between dinner and lunch. I could always give them a lecture about it, but I would risk being ruled out of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are embarking on a sensible programme involving sitting on Tuesday and Thursday mornings, I am prepared to sit until Easter if necessary, to do justice to the Bill. I recognise that that would be a concession on the Government's part because they have other important Bills to get through.

I know that party political points can be made about the disparity in the numbers of Conservative Members and the fact that it is impossible for them to run Standing Committees in tandem. That is a political fact of life and it is not worth making a song and dance about it. However, if we ran into a filibuster and started to sit through the night, progress would be so fast that it would be impossible, both for members of the Committee and interested people outside to make sense of the proceedings. That would be a disgrace. I shall make long speeches about that if it happens. But with good will, I think that we can progress. Subject to my qualification, I am willing to respond positively to the sittings motion, and I hope that we will soon start debating the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) stressed that this was an important Bill and I believe that all hon. Members would agree. However, I disagree with him that the Bill does not contain any matters which are contentious in party political terms. For example, I draw his attention to the proposed abolition of the Scottish Special Housing Association. There is strong feeling in Scotland that before the SSHA is abolished and taken over by the new agency Scottish Homes, the tenants should be consulted and balloted on the matter. I drew that point to the Minister's attention on Second Reading, but he failed to deal with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are forever going on about the need to ballot so that people have a chance to vote on what affects them. They see that as especially important among trade unionists. They were vehement during the miners' strike that the issue at stake was the ballot. The Government were prepared to spend £6,000 million on defeating the miners on that issue. The Bill completely changes the way that 83,000 tenants in Scotland will be housed, yet they will have no say. That was made clear by the SSHA's director, Mr. Derek Mason. He said, "What's the point of a ballot? We know what the result will be. The tenants will reject the Government's proposals to abolish the SSHA and replace it with Scottish Homes." The Government know what the result will be, so they have decided not to have a ballot on the SSHA abolition, denying the tenants the right to decide on their future. The Minister has yet to give any explanation about that. Why are SSHA tenants not being allowed to vote on whether they agree with the Bill's major proposals? We are anxious that those tenants have that right, and we shall try to ensure that in the course of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other matters are equally contentious. One of the main thrusts of the Bill is to attract private-sector investment into housing in Scotland. The Conservative party will argue that one of the ways of doing that is by tilting the balance between landlord and tenant away from the tenant and back to the landlord. That means weakening security of tenure and introducing much higher and unfair rents. That is a contentious issue. We are not as anxious for the Bill to be enacted as the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, and my hon. Friend for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) will lead us in our fight against the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
I am as anxious as the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire to move on to the detail of the Bill and to make sure that Committee proceedings do not decline into filibusters and all-night sittings. The Bill is too important not to be dealt with properly. We shall try to co-operate, but it would be gross negligence on our part if we did not take the opportunity of the sittings motion to raise several points of principle about the way in which the Government conduct the passage of the Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian said that he was surprised when the Minister moved the sittings motion this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are several amendments tabled on the issue of an SSHA ballot. Perhaps it would be best to go into detail on that when the amendments are discussed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already moved on from that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am new to Committee work, but I understand that it is not usual to move immediately to morning and afternoon sittings on Tuesdays and Thursdays. That shows the Government's slight contempt for the Opposition and for the people of Scotland who are anxious that the Bill should be carefully examined at length. That will not happen if we rush into all-night sittings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Falkirk, West (Mr. Canavan) appeared this morning briefly in Committee. I did not catch everything that he said, but I understood him to say that he was taking his demonstration elsewhere because of threats that had been issued by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From the Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Falkirk, West is not usually depressed by threats from his hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian. He mentioned that the Government were issuing threats about the way in which the Committee was being conducted. That is the worst possible start for the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian made the point well that people throughout Scotland, as well as Committee members and representatives of different organisations, are interested in the Committee proceedings. Therefore, it is important that the composition and timetabling of the Committee is such that people think that Scotland is getting a fair deal. Unfortunately, because of the way that the Government have manned the Committee, that does not appear to be so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the general election result in Scotland was a great embarrassment for the Government. It was not just because Scottish Conservatives were reduced to ten Members of Parliament—perhaps the lowest showing ever in the history of Scotland. If one studies the results of the past five general elections in Scotland, one finds that the percentage of Scots voting Conservative is about 28 per cent. If one studies the five general elections previous to that the percentage of Scots voting Conservative was almost 43 per cent. That shows that Scotland is out of step with Conservative thinking and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0091">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
the way in which the Government think they should introduce legislation to shape the future of Scotland. Scots do not want the legislation that the Government wish to impose on them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that a Conservative Minister—Walter Illiot—created the SSHA and that that was a valuable action, however long ago it may have occurred?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman is a new Member of Parliament, but before he responds to the Minister I should point out that he is straying from the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to direct my comments to the sittings motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that it was a good idea for a Conservative Minister to set up the SSHA, but that was when Scots used to vote Conservative. Perhaps that was because Conservative Ministers gave the Scots what they wanted then. However, Conservative Ministers are not giving Scotland what it wants now and that is why Scots no longer vote Conservative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Government are anxious to get the Bill through the Committee quickly and to ensure that they have a majority. I know that Standing Committees are supposed to have 18 members, but the Standing Orders also provide for a Committee to go ahead with only 16 members. If the Committee had only 16 members, the Government would still have a clear majority of two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the Government have done has caused offence in Scotland and that is what led to the demonstration by my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, West. For the first time since 1962, there are non-Scottish hon. Members on a Committee of an important Bill that will affect up to a million people in Scottish public-sector housing. The two English hon. Members know nothing about the Bill and will probably make no contribution in Committee. That is offensive and unnecessary because the Government could have kept the Committee all-Scottish and still secured their majority. Instead thay have decided to draft in two additional hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The absence of two of the four Ministers on the Committee eloquently expresses why there are two English Members on the Committee. The Ministers do not want to put in the work or give the Bill the detailed consideration that it deserves. Instead, they will spend their time on other matters and the two English hon. Members will act purely as Lobby fodder to secure the Government majority. If the Scottish Ministers treated the Bill seriously, they would be here religiously throughout the sittings of the Committee to vote whenever necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can understand the frustration of my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, West and why he staged his demonstration on Tuesday and again this morning. He, like other Scottish hon. Members—my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian mentioned my
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
hon. Friends the Members for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Dunnachie), for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall), for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe)—desperately wanted to sit on the Committee in order to use his constituency experience in Scotland to contribute towards the work on the Bill and to try to shape it in a way that will suit his constituents. That is not true of the Members for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnott) and for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) who do not represent Scottish seats and do not even take an interest in the work of the Committee. Thay are sitting there with their work piled up in front of them, probably answering letters from their constituents. They are not interested in what might happen to the people of Scotland if the Bill is passed. They are just sitting there and taking no part in the Committee whatsoever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two English hon. Members do not have any direct constituency interest, but what really hurts me is that they do not have any interest in the work of the Committee. I read in the Scottish press that the hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford said that he had volunteered to serve on the Committee, but was drafted on to it. If the Government had drafted people onto the Scottish Affairs Select Committee, that Committee would have been able to go ahead. I know that the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) does not want to serve on the Scottish Affairs Select Committee, but if Ministers had been as firm with him as they have been with the hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford, perhaps there would be a Scottish Affairs Select Committee to consider Scottish business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sittings motion will put the two English hon. Members on the Committee at a great disadvantage. They will have to go through a sharp learning curve if they are to make any contribution to the work of the Committee. They will have to find out about the SSHA, the housing corporations in Scotland, the district councils and how they run housing and housing associations, such as the Gowrie and Bield associations. The work of those associations will have to be familiar to them if they are to contribute. How will they have the opportunity to do that if they are to be here every Tuesday and Thursday morning and afternoon? I ask the Government to think again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire may one day return to the fold. He is one of the two to whom I would extend that invitation. But frankly he is entirely wrong if he thinks that this legislation is not deeply politically contentious and divisive, and is not causing much anxiety, even fear. As the flesh of the Bill is discussed in the next weeks on Tuesday and Thursday mornings and afternoons, and as we bring to the attention of the Scottish people what this measure holds, the hon. Member will revise his opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that you, Mr. Martin, will pull me up if I stray from the sittings motion, but the arguments of my hon. Friends are entirely germane. I said that I wanted to get off the issue of the declaration of interest in Scottish housing. I have a great deal of sympathy for the Minister as he was put under pressure. It was a little unfair and I accept the honourable way in which he conducted himself under that pressure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am worried because the sittings motion will not permit any education of those on the Committee dealing with this legislation who have no interest whatever in Scottish housing. Much has been said about several hon. Members in that boat who, on a Tuesday and Thursday morning and afternoon, will not even go through the motions of learning about Scottish housing or Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hoped—it may have been a naive hope as this is the first Standing Committee that I have served on—that we could, through you, Mr. Martin, organise an education programme for English Members of the Committee on this vital Scottish legislation. British Rail have some good offers in the next couple of weeks and we could arrange a day trip or even a two-day trip for people with no knowledge of Scotland, Scottish public-sector housing or the lower end of the private-rented sector. They may have seen a few Bill Forsyth films but know nothing else about Scotland. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I was referring to the hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford as he is the only one in that crew with the class to see a Bill Forsyth movie.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Seriously, with this timetable, how will the hon. Member for Penrith and The Border, who is busily and properly doing his constituency work, deal with this business as it proceeds? According to his name and by repute he is a Scotsman, albeit a deracinated Scot in exile for the furtherance of his political career. I wonder when he was last on a SSHA estate if ever and when he last visited the scene of the crime which the Government are about to perpetrate on Scottish tenants and residents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the hon. Member for Penrith and The Border contested the constituency of Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber in 1983. In the district of Inverness there are 1,215 Scottish Special Housing Association houses, in Lochaber 287 and in Nairn 131. I suspect that the hon. Gentleman may have visited some of them, but I do not think that he got many of their votes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not have attracted much support from the tenants of those houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The eloquent absence on Thursdays of the Secretary of State will always be the case. I make no protest—it is as well that he has a seat in the Cabinet, even if he makes little use of it and his voice is seldom heard. It is better that he is there than not, but it will be impossible for him to take his place and play a role in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had given the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) the benefit of the doubt. I thought that he was horizontal at the back of the Room, but he is reputably acting as learned counsel at a Scottish murder trial when he should be here. What are we to make of the withering contempt shown for the Scottish people and for this vital Bill by the absence of such an important member of the Conservative Back-Bench committee on Scotland? I am not sure if it is the 1922 Committee or the 1987 Committee, but it is certainly a small one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is one of the misfortunes of the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) that I know more about him than most hon. Members. I used to deliver his milk. He was a bus conductor, but had I known what his later incarnation would be, I might have interfered with the milk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The class background of my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian was mentioned, and the hon. Member for Tayside, North likes to say that he was a bus driver. I remember him before he was a bus driver—when he was a bus conductor. I used to pay him my fare on the bus from Linlathen to the centre of Dundee. My knowledge of that hon. Gentleman will become apparent over the next few years. He was a trade union member, and Vic Selway was his shop stewards convenor. Anyone who knows Vic Selway will know the comedy implicit in that juxtaposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have saved my most important remarks for the presence in the Committee of the hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot). Here on Tuesdays and Thursdays, mornings and afternoons, we shall be graced by his angular and convivial presence. I met the hon. Gentleman at the post office the other day, and we discovered that we have some mutual friends. He seems to be a terribly nice chap. It cannot possibly be right that, when we sit on Tuesdays and Thursdays, many vital decisions will turn, on the hon. Gentleman's vote, because of the obvious abscence of Ministers. Unlike the hon. Member for Penrith and The Border, he is not even a deracinated Scot—he has no connection with Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member is straying from the sittings motion.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—with the possible exception of the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must be germane to a sittings motion whether, in the proposed time available, we shall be able to educate the hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford so that we can properly discharge his responsibilities to the Committee, the House and the people of Scotland for whom he is legislating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As is my wont, Mr. Martin, I was thumbing through a volume of the works of Alexander Pope, the great English poet, who is a favourite of mine. I came upon a work that the hon. Gentleman may have heard before entitled "Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot". It contains much that is relevant to the sittings motion. I retrieved it from my case as I heard my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian mention the hon. Gentleman's presence on the Committee. Half way through the poem reads:
	<br><q><p>"You think this cruel? Take it for a rule,</p></q>
	<br><q><p>No creature smarts so little as a fool."</p></q>
I am sure that that is not relevant to the hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford; there are many more foolish members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell by your expression, Mr. Martin, that you do not wish me to quote any further, although I have many choice quotations that I shall pass to the hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford. However, I should like to read one more extract, in the middle of the rather long epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot, it says:
	<br><q><p>"Yet then did Dennis rave in furious fret:".</p></q>
If that is not germane to the sittings motion, I do not know what is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Proceedings on the Bill are absolutely in line with the way in which Scottish business is handled in the House. If I were writing—as one day I shall—a historical novel about the breakup of the United Kingdom, several serious steps towards that breakup would involve antics such as we have seen in the setting up of the Committee and in the sittings motion. With due respect to the hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford, the imposition of foreign labour, or foreign Tories, on to Committees such as this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Wanstead and Woodford, to whom the hon. Gentleman referred, has been acting chairman of a council housing committee and knows a good deal about housing. Furthermore, he is of Scottish descent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the first I have heard about the hon. Gentleman's Scottish descent. I should be interested to know what proportion of Scottish blood he has.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that the hon. Gentleman has been a member of a housing Committee, but it was in Kensington and Chelsea. There is little that is similar between estates in my constituency, or those of my hon. Friends, and housing in Kensington and Chelsea, although I am prepared to believe that the hon. Gentlman knows a thing or two about housing. I understand that the hon. Gentleman is a barrister specialising in rent law; I am not sure on whose side he has acted recently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
It seems ridiculous that the sittings motion will not provide anything like the time that will be required to educate Conservative Members—the Gatling-gun of the majority that the Conservative party wields—so that they can discharge their responsibilities properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I intend to say more, Mr. Martin, but I can tell from the looks that you are giving me that I have said enough about the sittings motion. I do not know whether my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian, who leads the Opposition will oppose the motion, but I am extremely unhappy about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was wondering whether the Under-Secretary of State wanted to say anything about those points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government's approach to the proceedings of the Committee is not a proper way to deal with such complex legislation. As so little consultation time has been available for circulating documents to local authorities, housing associations and others involved in Scottish housing, it is utterly improper to rush into rapid consideration of the Bill at this stage in mornings and afternoons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that I missed my opportunity at the beginning of the debate to submit a manuscript amendment so that the Committee could meet on mornings only at this stage. Nevertheless, I shall register our protest about the indecent haste with which the Government clearly intend to proceed, by voting against the sittings motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To have met on Tuesday and Thursday mornings only would have been perfectly adequate and proper, and would have allowed ample time for proper consultation with people in Scotland. However, it is wrong and indecent that the Government should seek to ram the Bill through quickly, starting next Tuesday. We have had no assurances that there will not be all-night sittings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was initially prepared to support the sittings motion, but the Minister cannot simply sit on his hands. He has made me suspicious that, as the hon. Member for East Lothian said, the Government will ram the Bill through. The Minister knows that, because Conservative Members are in the majority on the Committee, he can sit for as long as he wishes. If he introduces afternoon sittings next week and all-night sittings the following week, that will not be the best way to progress. So I shall consider my position carefully if the Committee divides.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to make too much of the name of this organisation, nor do I not want to detain the Committee with what may seem a rather trivial point. However, I am not happy about the style of the name chosen by the Government for the new quango. Indeed, I am not happy about the style of operation that the name implies. The name must originally have been coined by the author of the consultation document that was issued in May 1987, just before the general election, by Lord Ancram. He was then the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland with responsibility for housing and the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South. He has now returned to his previous occupation as the electorate of south Edinburgh decided that someone else could do his job better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always thought of the term "Scottish Homes"
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
as a reference to, or a pun on, the name of a mildly notorious family from the eastern borders of Scotland, mainly Berwickshire. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire could no doubt tell us about those people. It does not seem to be an appropriate name for such an organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress from the outset that the Labour party supports the principle of a Scottish housing development agency to support and co-ordinate the efforts of elected local housing authorities to provide for the housing needs of the Scottish people. A major investment programme is needed to combat homelessness, waiting lists, overcrowding, dampness and generally bad housing, with which we are all familiar in our constituencies. It is a massive task. Local authorities could be effectively assisted by a national agency with expertise and resources to back their efforts to build and upgrade houses in the public and private sectors. We can deal with the details later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish Homes is a different arrangement. The Government envisage a vast free-standing national quango, which appears to have the potential at least to displace the housing functions of elected local housing authorities. It will be accountable only to the Scottish Office. Its members will be appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland. It will have its own corporate image, which is conveyed by its name. I fear that it has disturbing prospects for privatisation at the whim of a future, or event the present Chancellor of the Exchequer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The conduct of quangos and appointed agencies in Scotland at present does not inspire confidence. The health boards are apparently happy to act as rubber stamps for the Government. The Government's manipulation of nominally independent agencies in Scotland is cause for concern. We shall examine later the case for direct representation for tenants and interested bodies on the governing body of this organisation. We shall discuss the substantive details later, but I shall conclude for now by saying that I do not like the name.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson). I do not wish to make too much of a name, but it can be very important. There is a substantial difference between "Scottish Homes" and "the Scottish Housing Agency". Scottish Homes has a more commercial ring. It is a wholly public sector body. On the tube this morning, I was alarmed to read in 	<i>The Guardian</i> a report of the Government's recent White Paper on public expenditure. It quotes from the White Paper and states:
	<br><q><p>"in future public expenditure will be concentrated on functions that do not interest the private sector, 'but always with a view to attracting the maximum private sector contributions.'"</p></q>
It is an alarming drift in the Government's housing policy that they are structuring it to suit the needs not of tenants and owner-occupiers but of the private sector. I fear that that may happen under the Scottish Homes agency. The Government will fashion their policies to suit the needs of the private sector first, and only then take into consideration the housing needs of the Scottish people. Therefore, I support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One issue needs at least passing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0095">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

thought. The name incorporates the image that this body will cut north of the border. The image is important. I would be worried if the work of this body had a too commercialised perspective. There have been disgraceful examples of public funds being spent by nationalised industries in preparation for privatisation. The South of Scotland Electricity Board is currently spending thousands of pounds of their consumers' money to promote itself in preparation for privatisation under the forthcoming legislation. It is important that we get the image of this organisation right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not subscribe to the view of the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson). To a Scottish lawyer, the word "agency" has a connotation of its own. There is the precedent of the Scottish Development Agency, which I admire, but the word "agency" implies direct relationship between whoever is directing the agent and the body itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be unhappy if money were spent on advertising agents, glossy brochures and expensive stationery and if image building products and devices were employed by the new body. I am content to allow the name "Scottish Homes" to stand, but only if the Minister assuages the worries raised in this debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, Too, am a little unhappy about the name. It has a sickly, new Right ring about it associated with the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), the Milo Minder-binder of the Government—Milo Minder-binder is the character in catch 22 who privatised his own air force. He rented it out to the Germans to bomb his own camp—"nice work if you can get it." That mentality is summed up in the title "Scottish Homes". There is something Orwellian about it too, which is in line with the current drift of the Conservative party's use of language. A Government who have turned the word "reform" into a dirty word meaning "turning backwards", and have turned "radical" into a dirty word meaning reactionary, are the kind of Government to come up with the title Scottish Homes for a project that will be extremely destructive of the rights of Scottish people to a home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether we will divide on the amendment but my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) made a congent speech in support of his proposed title. I hope that the Minister will respond to it positively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested to hear what the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) said about not being happy with the name. He made the important statement that he is not against the concept of a Scottish housing development agency, which is what Scottish homes would be. He also asked whether it would co-operate sufficiently with local authorities. The best evidence that I can give him that it would is the account which appeared today in both the 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> and 	<i>The Scotsman</i> involving £2 million supplementary
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
allocation which I had the opportunity to make late in the summer. That £2 million was given to the SSHA. It negotiated with the tenants. 	<i>The Scotsman</i> states:
	<br><q><p>"700 tenants from the Linn Park area turned out at the best attended public meeting ever held in the area to approve the sell-off plan."</p></q>
The advantage of that is that the SSHA got £2 million and bought the housing with the approval of the tenants—that is the key—and that gives Glasgow district council an extra £2 million to spend on the improvement of its stock. That is a good example of close co-operation between the SSHA—in future it will be Scottish Homes—and a local authority. Obviously, it is not for the Government to work out the details. Negotiations took place between the SSHA and the Glasgow district council with the full involvement of tenants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested to hear the Minister refer to the close co-operation which exists at present between the SSHA and local authorities, but the new agency—Scottish Homes—is seen as a threat by the local authorities. They fear that Scottish homes could co-operate with the private sector to take over local authority housing stock. There will therefore be no chance of real co-operation between the new agency and the local authorities under the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would in fact open up new opportunities. The key to this is the approval of tenants. The headline in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> runs:
	<br><q><p>"Tenants opt for sell-off and prospect of rent-rise".</p></q>
Very careful consideration was given to the proposal to change the name to one similar to the SDA in view of the close resemblance that it is intended to bear to the SDA. In setting up the new body, the Government want to recognise and build upon the success of the SDA but it is necessary to change the name to reflect that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members are aware, the consultation on the proposals set out in the paper "Scottish Homes", which was drafted before the election, was widespread and thorough. Our proposals have been the subject of many discussions, meetings and conferences. A letter from the Secretary of State for Scotland was sent to each SSHA tenant by the SSHA chairman. There has also been a lot of discussion among finance institutions, housing asociations, representative groups and individual trenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals are now closely associated with the name Scottish Homes, and any change in the name would cause confusion and might also be wrongly interpreted as accompanying a change in policy. I am particularly concerned that confusion would be caused to those many elderly tenants who were caused unnecessary anxiety by a scaremongering NALGO leaflet which was distributed in the summer. The Government and the SSHA have gone to considerable lengths to put the record straight, but that reassurance refers specifically to Scottish Homes. A change of name might suggest to some tenants that their rights had changed too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present in Scotland there are about 130,000 more houses than households, and one of the agency's
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0096">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
purposes would be to bring a considerable proportion of them back into use. The image of the provision for bringing more homes in Scotland back into use is wholly worthy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to press the Minister about the image. It will be offensive to those who are administered by this agency if it produces lavish and glossy publications that clearly squander money that could be better applied to housing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's point speaks for itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little surprised by some of the Minister's comments, which went wider than the title of the debate. It is always wonderful to behold any Minister quoting in his praise press reports that were issued from his own press office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was issued from the meeting held by the chairman of Glasgow district council and was reported by both the 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> and 	<i>The Scotsman.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall let the Minister get away with that, but we shall watch the antics of his press office and the previous press officer—the notorious Alex Paget, who was press officer for the Scottish Office for a long time and now works more honestly in the direct employment of the Conservative party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We support and endorse the co-operation that the Minister talked about, but we are worried that the style of operation envisaged by the Government is unlikely to provide for the co-operation that has existed between the Scottish Special Housing Association and local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister had better watch his p's and q's from now on because I notice that his boss has just crawled back into the Committee from a Cabinet meeting. I wonder which if our interests he has sold out in the past hour or two, but we look forward to receiving his full and undivided attention on housing during the next few moments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are encouraged by the Minister's assertion that the Scottish Homes quango should operate in the same style as the relevant part of the SSHA, in co-operation with elected local authorities. We shall return frequently to the position of elected local authorities. I have in mind some of the smaller local authorities, including one on which I served once, and which the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) knows well.

Some small rural local authorities in the Borders, the Highlands and in Dumfries and Galloway are second-class district councils as they do not have planning functions. If their housing functions are taken away, they will have nothing left to do and so they must be worried about the style of operation that the Government are setting up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further along this Committee Corridor, another Committee is considering the Housing Bill, which, as
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
far as I know, contains no idea of establishing an English Homes operation, parallel to the Scottish one. This measure is therefore specifically Scottish and it is proper that the Committee should look carefully at its actual operation and the precise statutory framework within which it will operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister took the somewhat unlikely opportunity of this debate to talk about recent scaremongering among tenants of SSHA. That was touched upon during Second Reading when lively exchanges took place between my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) and the Secretary of State—from which the Secretary of State did not emerge too well. The SSHA consultative document issued last May says:
	<br><q><p>"Arrangements for a 'landlord' division would be essentially transitional and Scottish homes would be asked to prepare and implement, as a matter of priority, proposals for new management arrangements for tenanted houses in SSHA estates in different areas of the country."</p></q>
It was very clear in three or four parts of that consultative document that the Government intended at that stage for tenanted homes belonging to the SSHA to be hived off, one way or another, to anyone except the local authority. There was an implicit suggestion that when Scottish Homes was set up, SSHA tenants would be compelled to go outside the public sector. The Minister should not be unduly surprised that that gave rise to anxiety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has since been rapid back-pedalling on that issue, which we welcome. We have been assured that this will not be just a transitional arrangement, and that the Government intend Scottish Homes to be a responsible public sector landlord, broadly the same as the SSHA. I know that that is a byway in terms of this debate, but I was goaded by the Minister to respond. If the Minister wants to have another bite at the cherry, he is very welcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am giving way. The Minister is making difficulties for himself because, before I sit down, I intend to withdraw the amendment, which will prevent the Minister from saying anything more about it. If there is anything causing him great anxiety that he wants to get off his chest, I suggest that he does so now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the White Paper, paragraph 2.7 makes the position clear, saying:
	<br><q><p>"Scottish Homes will continue the existing role of the SSHA as a model landlord in relation to its own stock, with particular emphasis on developing greater choice for its tenants and offering them opportunities to adopt different management or ownership arrangements which will allow them to enjoy improved services, better housing conditions or greater control of their housing. It will be for tenants to exercise these choices, as and when they wish to."</p></q>
The NALGO leaflet, to which I referred, says that tenants will be hustled and badgered. I wish to make it absolutely clear that that is wholly untrue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman spoke about the agency being accountable only to the Scottish Office. Clause 11 provides that Scottish Homes will be accountable to Parliament through the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Comptroller and Auditor General.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
Those arrangements are similar to those which apply to the Scottish Development Agency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that intervention. Given the present structure of government in Scotland, the lack of accountability, and the lack of willingness to pay heed to the wishes of the Scottish people, the assurance that Scottish Homes will be accountable to the Secretary of State for Scotland does not afford many of us much encouragement or succour. Nevertheless, I accept that the Minister is making that point in good faith.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a broad welcome for the fact that the White Paper, published in November, was different in one or two important ways from the Government's consultative document published in May. One of the most important differences concerns the future of SSHA tenants. The White Paper said that there would be scope for those tenants to carry on being public sector tenants if they chose. That was a climbdown which we welcomed most wholeheartedly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should not complain about the NALGO leaflet and the other publications that were circulating on the subject of SSHA tenants in the latter half of last year. They were responding to the Government's intentions, as suggested in the consultative document which was, frankly, alarming. There was no question of scaremongering. The alarm was caused by the Government's specific proposals about Scottish Homes in the original consultative document last May.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need not detain the Committee much longer on the earth-shattering subject of the title of the new quango. This has been a wide-ranging and general debate about the style of the operation, which Opposition Members do not like much. However, I do not propose to divide the Committee on the amendment, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
It is difficult to find in the Bill limitations on that wide function.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill marks a considerable shift in philosophy away from the provision of public housing towards housing as an investment. Hitherto, Goverments of all parties have taken the view that public housing should be provided as a fundamental necessity. I recently received, as did other hon. Members from the Nationwide Anglia Building Society, its most recent survey of house prices. For the year to the end of September 1987, house prices have risen by 19 per cent., compared with an estimated annual rise in retail prices of 4.1 per cent. and a 7.5 per cent rise in average earnings. Housing is a lucrative investment which the Bill supports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will lead to increases in house prices. We should contrast what is contained in subsection (3) with the existing law. For example, the Housing Corporation's powers to lend which will be subsumed in the new Scottish Homes, and which are set out in section 79 of the Housing Associations Act 1985, are carefully circumscribed. Corporations have the power to lend to a registered housing association, to an unregistered self build society, or to a subsidiary of the corporation or any other body with which the corporation holds an interest. Section 79(2) provides that a corporation may lend to an individual for the purpose of assisting that individual to acquire from the corporation. Of course, anyone who wishes to buy his house from the corporation will be provided with finance. These are tight and severe restrictions, but such restrictions are not proposed in the Bill. Wide power is proposed. It speaks of
	<br><q><p>"assisting in the provision of, finance to persons or bodies".</p></q>
Certain powers will be limited by the constitution of Scottish Homes, but that does not limit that extremely wide power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are very keen on privatisation. It is the current buzz word. It is the Government's macho virility symbol. The speed with which their various Departments can achieve levels of privatisation is important. Over the past eight years, the Government have encouraged a high level of privatisation of council houses by their council house sales policy. We are now witnessing the privatisation of investment in public housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Bill is enacted, what impact will it have on banks or building societies? What consultations does the Minister have with those authorities? The Bill will enable Scottish Homes to compete with banks and building societies in providing finance for housing. Although that is feasible for someone who wants to become an owner-occupier, it is more likely to happen at the higher end of the market, with lending for speculation in housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I am correct in saying that the Bill will allow Scottish Homes to compete in the lending market with banks and building societies, it will have an impact on the friends of Conservative Members, many of whom are from banks and building societies. I am sincerely worried about the distorting effect that it will have on the Scottish housing market—particularly on house prices—because of the potential for large-scale
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0098">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
investment from public funds in building, particularly speculative house building.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To stick with the theme of privatisation, we must also consider the impact that the privatisation of Scottish Homes would have in the long term. Do the Government intend to consider the privatisation of that new quango? Scottish Homes will acquire a considerable portfolio in land and buildings once the Bill is enacted, and it may be too attractive for the Scottish Office to ignore the possibility of privatising it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are genuine fears. I have probably said enough to introduce the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should start by answering the questions that the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) asked about competition with the private sector banks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish Homes will act as a lender of last resort. Its purpose is to meet the needs that are not currently being met, not to compete with bodies that are already fulfilling their function well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister point to the provision that limits Scottish Homes' authority? I cannot find it in the Bill. The clause seems completley open ended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am reasonably certain that that provision exists. [Hon. Members: "Where?"] I shall inquire about that point but, to my knowledge, what I said is accurate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister leaves that point, I remind him that I asked whether he has consulted banks and building societies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, during the consultation period, representations were submitted. If the hon. Gentleman wishes me to give an account of the results of those consultations, I can certainly do so. All the organisations—companies, financial institutions, building societies, construction companies and representative bodies—welcomed the proposals for a unified housing agency. Although they agreed with the aims and objectives, they had reservations about certain proposals. Indeed, building societies saw them as a risky investment, and the Scottish Building Employers' Federation considered that uncertainties in the market meant that the private sector would play only a minimal role unless there were major changes in the rent and taxation legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That will probably happen gradually because when tenants were given the right to buy, we could not foresee how many would take up the offer. In fact, more than 100,000 have done so and building societies have provided an ever-increasing number of mortgages. It has often been said by politicians of all parties that public investment acts as a catalyst to private investment in housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that this will be the first of many debates on part I intended to probe the nature of the powers to be given to Scottish Homes. As my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State said on Second Reading, part I has a family resemblance to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
Scottish Development Agency Act 1975. That is no accident. We have been impressed by the way in which a body like the SDA, when given a wide remit and adequate powers, can provide an appropriate response to almost any problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who are inclined to see crocodiles in the custard will see such generalised powers as something untoward, but the SDA has never abused its powers. Indeed, the Scottish economy has benefited from them and we expect that Scottish housing will benefit from the powers to be given to Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments deal with the function of Scottish Homes financially to assist housing activities. Our policies are aimed at diversity of provision and we are encouraged in that by the many new proposals that have come to us, to the housing corporation and to local authorities from all quarters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, I have here the Nationwide Anglia housing statement, which suggests that £600 million of investment could be committed to housing. That shows that although private investment is on a gradual basis it is considerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a rapid rise in the popularity of the co-operative movement, which does not sit easily in the financial framework of local authority or housing corporation powers. More recently, a new company called "Quality Street", has been proposed to be funded by the Nationwide Anglia building society which will require different attitudes to its financing. There are many more new developments in progress and that surge in activity is a good omen for the popularity of our policies. However, there is no common theme to these developments, at least not in financial terms. In responding to local needs—whether of client, landlord, geography or tenure—solutions emerge which require specialised techniques. That is exactly what happened in the example of Castlemilk, which I mentioned earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The highly successful financial regime operated through the Housing Corporation, the housing association grant—HAG—is increasingly limiting the scope of what can be done. In the words of Raymond Young, director of the Housing Corporation in Scotland, the housing association movement has
	<br><q><p>"come to the end of the technology".</p></q>
The powers of Scottish Homes, financial and non-financial, are drawn widely to avoid that problem. If we knew the sort of proposal that would emerge in our search for diverse provision, we could set down rigid schemes to which they would have to conform. But we do not know how matters will develop and we do not wish to constrain what might be achieved. If Scottish Homes is to succeed in making the radical improvements to Scottish housing that we seek, we must give it powers to assist financially, subject to proper controls, in any way that will achieve the ultimate goal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1(3)(a) is intended to allow existing forms of financial assistance to continue and to allow scope for the development of new forms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill gives the development agency wider scope to speed housing renewal in Scotland. The clause also embraces Scottish Homes paying housing association grant to registered housing associations. It embraces
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0099">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>37</span>
grants or other forms of financial assistance given to landlords or developers for projects the costs and returns of which militate against their proceeding and which would have real benefits, for housing in the area. It would also embrace assistance to be given to owner-occupiers, for example, through the power in clause 2(8) for Scottish Homes to give improvement and repairs grants under the same powers as local authorities currently do. We shall come to that precise power when we discuss clause 2. The terms of the provision under discussion are unaffected by whether or not clause 2(8) is retained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the specific changes proposed, amendment No. 3 deletes the words
	<br><q><p>"and assisting in the provision of."</p></q>
Scottish Homes would be able only to provide assistance itself and would be precluded from arranging financial assistance from other sources available. Without these words Scottish Homes could not, as part of its main functions, bring together housing associations and pension funds; developers and banks; charitable foundations and the co-operatives, or any permutation of needs and finance. The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) mentioned that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such brokerage activity is an important part of the function of assisting; Scottish Homes, with a wide knowledge and experience of the housing scene, will be able to match investors and providers and bring them together to mutual benefit. Where necessary, the function of assisting in that way can be extended to the giving of guarantees or indemnities so that, where a project appears to have good social benefits but its financial success is less certain, Scottish Homes can assist the introduction of private finance by the giving of a guarantee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 2 proposes a much more subtle change, at present, the test of whether Scottish Homes can give or arrange assistance is the general intention of the recipient. The effect of the amendment appears to be to make the test Scottish Homes' intention as to what precisely should be done with the money. Clearly, there is not much in this. In so far as there is a difference, the effect of the amendment would appear to be to put in doubt Scottish Homes' ability to provide assistance towards expenditure not directly attributable to direct works on housing—for example, a housing association's general overheads. That would be an undesirable change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 11 proposes a change so subtle that I find it hard to perceive. Its effect would be to enable Scottish Homes to give or arrange financial assistance to a body whose function is to provide or carry out other work on housing as well as to one that has the intention of doing so, which the Bill referes to at present. The amendment makes a difference only if there is a body with the function, but not the intention, of providing or carrying out other work on housing. It is hard to imagine such an entity, but if one exists Scottish Homes is hardly likely to wish to assist it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
Amendment No. 4 would have a much more significant and damaging effect. In seeking to examine the function of Scottish Homes in giving financial assistance to the improvement or repair of houses, Opposition Members have identified an important extension to the role that Scottish Homes will have. The Housing Corporation has powers to assist registered housing associations that are carrying out the improvement or repair of houses and they will continue. One effect of the amendment would be to make Scottish Homes less able than the Housing Corporation to assist housing associations. The function is also intended to have a wider scope in enabling Scottish Homes to give assistance to bodies other than registered housing associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing new in the general concept of giving financial assistance to private landlords and developers. The existing improvement and repair grant scheme, which has developed over many years, is an example. It enables local authorities to give grant to private landlords for the improvement and repair of houses that they let. This is on terms identical to those of the grants to owner-occupiers, which have become the more traditional use for these grants. The Scottish Development Agency also gives financial assistance to developers for some housing projects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision is intended to embrace assistance given where, for example, it is intended that houses will be improved or repaired for use in other tenures, including owner-occupation. An important example of that is where tenants take over collective ownership of their homes through a co-operative, such as in Calvay. The main expenditure of such a co-operative is likely to be on the improvement and repair of the houses in which the tenant owners are living.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that there are many houses in unusable condition, and this power will enable assistance to be given to those persons who are willing to take on the task of bringing them up to a good standard for sale, but for whom the costs and returns are unlikely to make the venture worth while. Our aim is a broader one, of bringing housing back into use, and we think it right that grant, on a limited scale and in the right circumstances, should be available for such purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those powers are not, of course, unfettered. The financial powers of Scottish Homes are subject to approval of the Secretary of State, given with the consent of the Treasury, which may be given for a particular case of in accordance with a general authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The funding will be based on what is paid to the Scottish Special Housing Association and the Housing Corporation.

The gross capital allocation for the SSHA for 1988–89 is £54·86 million, while the Housing Corporation's allocation has increased to £132 million or £133 million. It has increased by nearly £10 million—a considerable increase. No doubt those funds will be of great value in urban regeneration projects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members may be worried that the powers are an attack on local authority powers in relation to financial assistance for the improvement and repair of houses. That is not the case. As in many other respects, the activities of Scottish Homes will complement, rather than compete with, those local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the machinery for doing that?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State has the powers of direction in clauses 2(3), 2(9) and 10 which will be used to regulate the way in which Scottish Homes uses its financial powers, including lending.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not say that I do not. Many of the complaints about the way the needs of small rural authorities are discussed are entirely justified. But that is straying out of order.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Gentleman's general principle. I hope that before we discuss many groups of amendments we can satisfy him on that point. Housing associations in Scotland have greatly extended their acitivity into many rural areas throughout Scotland in the past three years. That is wholly admirable and something that we should be pleased about. The amendments are undesirable. The clause contains a broad power to give financial assistance where it is needed. There are adequate controls on the use of this power elsewhere in the Bill and I am sure that on reflection the hon. Gentleman will wish to withdraw his amendment, failing which I must ask the Committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendments suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran). The Minister spent some time on amendment No. 4 which relates to improvement and repair. He said that the powers which the new agency would have to assist in the improvement and repair of houses built on similar powers held by the Housing Corporation of Scotland through the housing associations. However, he added that the powers which had been transferred to the new agency would have a wider scope. I assume that that would be as wide as the local authorities have at present to issue grants for improvements and repairs. I understood the Minister to say that Scottish Homes would have exactly parallel powers to those of the local authorities here. The Minister must explain why it is necessary to duplicate those functions at a local level in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, Dundee district council has an improvement and repair grant unit which considers all applications for grants and makes decisions based on local knowledge. That local knowledge helps the unit to assess housing need priorities in Dundee and to allocate grants accordingly. It can also check that the money is being properly spent. It knows what goes on in Dundee. A case was brought to my attention recently of a property developer, the Minister obviously has a lot of time for property developers, although I am not so keen on them myself. This property developer applied for an improvement grant to rewire a house which he had taken over. When the improvement and repair grant unit checked it out, it discovered that he had not rewired it at all; he had simply cut back about four or five inches behind the sockets, put in new wires and then claimed a grant from the council. The council discovered that and got the money back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will Scottish Homes achieve that? The Minister can sit in Edinburgh all he likes talking to COSLA but that will not solve the problem of how Scottish Homes will ensure that any grants it gives under the new powers to property developers at local level are properly spent and properly applied for. The

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>41</span>
Minister has not answered that question. In fact, he has not said much, although I appreciate that it is early in the Committee's proceedings. How will Scottish Homes work? Will there be local units in every area of Scotland? Will they duplicate the local Authorities' manpower and spend more money by having two sets of people doing the same thing? Is that what the Government are suggesting?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people involved in property development are sharks who wish to exploit and rip off the Government, the local authority and the public. There is a company registered in Aberdeen called Piranha Property Developers, which applied for grants from Dundee. The company received the grants because it met the criteria. I do not know whether the name was a joke on the part of the property developers, but it sums up the attitude and approach of some of them. Those attitudes need to be examined closely. The Minister has not explained what machinery Scottish Homes will have to monitor property developers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nor did the Minister answer the point raised by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood). There is a danger that the local authority and Scottish Homes will get out of kilter with each other, working in the same area. Someone who is refused a grant by a local authority can trip along to Scottish Homes and perhaps receive a grant. Will the Minister ensure that there is a system by which the people who process applications and make decisions can work together coherently, so that an applicant cannot play one group off against the other to obtain a grant?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly subscribe to the spirit, if not the exact wording of the amendments so ably moved by the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran). Like the Minister, I could not see the link between amendment No. 4 and what is in the Bill. I suppose that lawyers spend a great deal of time earning a livelihood outside this place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For me, the original point made by the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South is the key point in this group of amendments. It relates to the phrase
	<br><q><p>"assisting in the provision of"</p></q>
in clause 1. During his remarks, the Minister received some inspiration from the usual sources. He sought to allay some of the fears expressed by sharing advice with the Committee. I confess that I do not understand the answer that he gave, but I am not an expert in matters of high finance. It would be helpful if he rehearsed some of those arguments again at greater length. Listening carefully to the Minister, I found some of his remarks helpful. We can study them at length, and they will probably flesh out the background to the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The process of assisting in the provision requires careful monitoring and scrutiny. I do not want to stray out of order, Mr. Martin, but clause 1(3)(e) makes deliberate and explicit reference to the provision of monitoring and control. It would be remiss of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
Committee to leave the phrase
	<br><q><p>"assisting in the provision of"</p></q>
so vague, because clause 1(3) is the heart of the Bill. It would be helpful if the Minister could fill some of the perhaps inadvertent gaps in his remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire that there are gaps to be filled. I am sure that we shall have a useful relationship with him during this Committee's proceedings. As he has fallen out with some of his erstwhile friends, perhaps Labour Members should address him as our hon.Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A new alliance—they might even merge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Without doing us to much damage in the process, I hope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a useful, wee debate which enables us to have an omnibus debate on subsection (3)(a) which, as the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire said, is the central part of the Bill. We have had some colourful language. The picture of crocodiles in the custard referred to by the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) speaks volumes about west Edinburgh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want further information on important aspects of this paragraph. Amendment No. 3, ably moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran), affords the Committee a useful opportunity to probe the exact meaning of "assisting in the finance of" under the terms of the Bill. The Minister owes it to the Committee and to tenants and financial institutions in Scotland to tell us more about the precise role that the Government have in mind for Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister understandably took advantage of this opportunity to read out some of the recent publicity material of the Nationwide Anglia building society on their proposed investment in rented housing in Scotland. The Opposition do not have the Scottish Tory party's hang-up that the private sector is good and the public sector is bad, or vice versa. We believe in good quality housing being made available to the people of Scotland. If they want to buy their house, that is fine; if they want to rent their house from the private or public sector, that is fine too. We recognise that there is an urgent need for more housing to let.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy that that building society proposes to invest a lot of money in rented housing in Scotland. My only worry is about the rents that they are likely to charge and the lack of rent control proposed by the Government. If the Minister had read further on in the hand-out from the Nationwide Anglia building society, he would have seen an interesting little paragraph which states:
	<br><q><p>"With a new housing bill promising changes in rent restrictions, houses for rent are here to stay."</p></q>
That is the view of a financial institution. It is fairly obvious that it is only interested in this proposition because there is a gap in the market and with a bit of luck it will make some money out of it, as it is perfectly entitled to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>43</span>
I see that the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) is nodding vigorously. He is all for people making money. We believe in a mixed economy too—fair enough. But the Bill lacks a fair consideration of the needs of people who want to be tenants. The vast majority of people stuck on housing waiting lists or homeless in Scotland are unlikely to be able to rent houses built by the private sector. But we shall have ample opportunity to deal with that point later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Minister will tell us more, if not at this sitting then at the next sitting of the Committee, about the Government's intentions and what framework of controls they have in mind to deal with the financial activities of Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 2 is intended to earmark the funds disbursed by Scottish Homes so that they will be used specifically for housing. The Amendment is also intended to encompass expenditure directly associated with housing. The clause as drafted provides that money can be given to bodies
	<br><q><p>"intending to provide, improve, repair, maintain or manage housing".</p></q>
I dare say that Mr. John de Lorean managed to persuade someone some years ago that he intended to manufacture sports cars in Belfast, and a large amount of public money went into supporting that enterprise. Likewise, someone could say to Scottish Homes that he intended to build a house in Springburn, Mr. Martin. Whether he does so may be open to debate. Nevertheless, under the clause Scottish Homes would be free to hand over money or give him credit. There should be better control over that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Amendment No. 11, the Minister has given an assurance that existing housing bodies are covered and that the legislation does not apply only to bodies that intend to get involved in housing in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall have further opportunities to speak about Amendment No. 4, but it is incongruous to have two sets of public authorities with indentical powers—the national quango of Scottish Homes handing out home improvement grants in every nook and cranny of Scotland. The Government cannot seriously intend to employ two sets of officials in every area to disburse grants, inspect plans and works. That does not make sense, which suggests that the Government intend to remove that power from local authorities in the future. We would be hostile to such a proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is ironic that the hon. Gentleman remarked this morning that the Committee was going to proceed too quickly, because his final comments relate to clause 2(8) which deals with the
	<br><q><p>"Power of the Secretary of State to give directions to prevent duplications of grant."</p></q>
He is right to suggest that there should be no unnecessary duplications.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which way is the hon. Gentleman going to jump?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we can go into greater detail when we reach clause 2(8). At present
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
many people with useful housing projects, including housing to let, find it difficult to establish a channel of contact with financial institutions. The Scottish Federation of Housing Associations made that point. Scottish Homes will examine ways of helping them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall explain what I meant by the phrase "lender of the last resort". Scottish Homes will lend money only when someone has tried and failed to borrow money elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What are the collateral requirements?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall discuss the financial arrangements in the Bill when I shall give a full answer to the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: People who come to the agency on the basis that it is the lender of the last resort obviously would not have the necessary collateral to find financial support. Would loans be provided at a lower rate than the market rate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of those matters will be dealt with by Scottish Homes. The consent of the Secretary of State and the Treasury is required if a big project is involved. Of course the Secretary of State will be accountable to Parliament in the same way as the SDA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some risks are taken by the SDA in certain circumstances, which benefit Scotland. Its record in providing more employment has been good and the record of Scottish Homes providing more homes would also be good. The only difference is that they will do it on a much wider scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Private owners usually shift their homes once every seven years. According to research many more people would like an extension of opportunity. The Bill provide that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not entirely satisfed with the Minister's answers; particularly his analogy with the SDA. There is considerable difference between the proposed Scottish Homes and the SDA. Scottish Homes will have a large portfolio of investment properties in a housing market that will be radically different from the present one. The Government are trying to create a new high rent and investment-led market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about some of the Minister's expressions. He used the word "brokerage" when he spoke of property developers. That tone surrounds the Bill. The Bill does not deal with the problems of the homeless or with the poor repair and condition of housing. Having heard the Minister and the debate on the functions of Scottish Homes I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
