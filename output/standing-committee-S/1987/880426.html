	<p>No. 70, in page 1, line 8, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) The timing of the establishment of School Boards will be conditional upon adequate financial provision being made to education authorities to establish and support such Boards. The level of financial provision will be the subject of consultation and agreement with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities.".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 38, in page 1, line 24, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(6) Notwithstanding any of the above it shall be the right of the parents of a school not to have a School Board subject to the following:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>If at the initial establishment of a School Board or at the time of any subsequent biennial election a number of parents, as specified in section 13(1), request in writing of the Education Authority that the functions of the School Board should be exercised by the Authority, the Authority shall proceed to a ballot (in accordance with provisions of Schedule 1) of all parents of pupils in attendance at the school to determine whether a majority of all parents voting in the ballot are in support of the request. Given that there is a majority of all parents in favour of the request, the functions of the School Board shall be exercised by the education authority until such time as a request for a School Board and a ballot in favour are carried out under the conditions specified above and at the times specified above.".</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our previous discussion on the amendment was about choice. Discussions with parents, educationists and administrators in my constituency over the weekend have reinforced our arguments. Those people felt that it would be reasonable to include a provision for parents to use their judgment about the school board proposal and, if necessary, to vote not to have a school board in their area but to reaffirm their commitment to the local authority's education provision. Like Opposition Members, they thought that that would not preclude other forms of parental involvement being considered and implemented for particular schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall pinpoint our objections to the Government proposals and rehearse our arguments in favour of the amendments. The Government have been talking about and promoting the idea of choice in relation to the Bill. Our first objection is that we do not equate choice with forcing parents, education authorities and professionals into a rigid system of parental involvement throughout Scotland. The Government's definition of democracy is only on their terms. People have the right to say yes to Government proposals but not to say no. Our amendment seeks to extend choice and democracy so that if parents in a catchment area do not want a school board they can vote for the status quo and retain the possibility of discussing different ways of implementing parental choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our second major concern is about the politicisation of school boards. The Government do not appear to have considered that aspect, although something was said at our previous sitting about the problem of school boards being hijacked by one political party or another. It is inconceivable that if such boards are established there will not be a degree of politicisation that will both influence control and direct their functioning. It is naive to assume that because the boards are for educational purposes they will not attract the political extremes. A service that has ostensibly been provided by politicians at regional level could become a service that bypasses the normal democratic processes and the professionalism that is essential for our schools, allowing a politically motivated tiny minority of parents to take major decisions on the welfare of children and the direction of schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If parents in an area could decide not to be involved in a school board, that would allow them to take on the issue of the politicisation of the boards and to say that they did not want that level of political debate in the school. School boards for comprehensive schools present a particular problem because such large schools and so many parents would be involved. It would be ridiculous to move from a settled pattern of education and accountability to one in which the nature of school board elections and procedures could lead to a form of educational anarchy which would not be in the interests of parents, children or the development of the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government must take seriously the politicisation of school boards and ask themselves whether it would be a good thing at that level of the political educational debate where there may be a handful of parents on a committee with a majority of decision-making in their favour. People in my constituency have told me that they do not want schools to become immersed in party politics. The Government
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0799">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>83</span>
run the danger of that happening if they continue to ignore reasonable amendments which are about giving parents a choice on whether they wish to dissociate themselves from this form of parental involvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Linked with the politicisation of the debate is the question of how unrepresentative a group may be when the first elections are held. If, in the first elections, there was apathy and few people participated, there could be two consequences. A wholly unrepresentative minority would be involved in the school and, equally important, it could lead to pressure for the political machines in an area to select parents and ensure that when the votes are taken and the decisions made there will be party political representation. That is worrying Scottish parents, and it is certainly worrying us. The Government may say, "We have a vested interest in politicising everything," but that is not necessarily the way forward for a primary or comprehensive school. Real dangers have been flagged up this morning and I hope that the Minister will respond to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have talked about forcing choice upon parents and the politicisation of schools. There is one further important fact that I should mention. The Labour party is interested in consumerism and its relationship with collective provision, but that can best be dealt with if parents have a genuine opportunity to make their judgments known and be accepted by the system. There is great unease within education authorities about the way in which the Government have seen fit to bulldoze this proposal through the consultation process and bring it forward in a Bill. The consumers—the parents and their children—want the best possible education. The key feature of the Government's attack on the state sector in Scotland is largely to ignore deep concerns and systems of education which have endured over many decades. Why are the Government, in their desire to pursue ideological objectives, not willing to accept the idea not only of collective provision being linked with consumer choice, but of the consumer actually having choice and not, as in the Bill and the board proposals, choice only on the Government's terms?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will respond positively to what is, in essence, a simple and elementary suggestion for improving a bad Bill. It is also common sense. No one on the Government Benches should deny people an alternative choice in this new system of democracy that the Government embrace so enthusiastically. Parents, educationists, administrators and teachers are asking why on earth, if the Government believe the measure to be so popular—despite a consultation process which massively rejected most of what is on offer—they will not allow parents to decide whether they wish to have school boards imposed on them. If the Government accepted the amendment, it would reinforce their collective commitment to this measure. More importantly, it would take choice at face value and allow parents to say, "Yes, we will embrace that concept" or "No, we want to stick by the education authority and develop other ideas which will give a host of parents wider involvement rather than just the narrow spectrum thrown up by the Bill."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to direct my attention to amendments Nos. 70 and 38. The Minister is setting up school boards on which there will be 25,000 representatives. If democracy means anything, 50,000 people will stand for those boards. I was one of 900 people at Boghead park on Saturday where Dumbarton played East Fife. Afterwards the directors told me that they had financial problems. I said, "Contact the Minister because he has 50,000 people in Scotland, and I am sure that he will give you one tenth of them for an afternoon."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cumbernauld and Kilsyth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is responsible for sport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is correct. If he gave the directors 5,000 people, Dumbarton's problems would disappear for the year. There may be a letter waiting on the Minister's desk as a result of his initiative on school boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where are those 50,000 people? And where is the £5 million for setting up school boards? How did the Minister arrive at that figure? If Dumfries and Galloway authority has estimated the cost at £20 million, how in the name of reasoned accounting can the Minister talk about £5 million? If there are to be 25,000 members, that would be less than £200 per school board member, notwithstanding setting up the administration and organisation. Surely it would have been fair to request a feasibility study from local authorities and ask how much they estimate the cost to be. I do not think that the Minister has done that. We will undertake that feasibility study if the Minister does not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 38 provides for a ballot of parents. That has been stressed in previous speeches. Scotland the overriding message throughout the consultation period was that parents had confidence in the local education authorities and in the professionalism of teachers. They had confidence in the management of local authorities to direct education to their children, but not in other parents taking over the management and executive responsibilities of education. That message came out loud and clear during the consultation period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's proposals are ill thought out. The example of Cardross assessment centre in my constituency illustrates that. Children attend the centre for five or six weeks. Are parents of those children to be involved in setting up a school board for that centre? On average, children stay at the centre for just a few months, but under the Bill school boards will have to be set up for such organisations. The parents' main worry, fuelled by the membership regulations for school boards, which came out at the weekend, is that a small unrepresentative clique of parents will take over schools and direct them in ways that the majority of parents do not want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The membership regulations for schools with between 501 and 1,000 pupils—in Strathclyde, the largest region in Scotland, the vast majority of secondary schools come within that range—provide for five parent members, three co-opted members and one member of staff. That is a ratio of eight to one. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0800">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
Minister spoke about partnership in education. How can he conceivably think about partnership in education when there is a ratio of one staff member to eight others? It is an insulting and provocative document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The document has nothing to do with the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has everything to do with the amendment because it involves parents and unrepresentative cliques.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The correspondence in the 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> in the past few weeks expressed disquiet about the unfair and possibly unrepresentative decisions of the board of Jordanhill college. That is a pointer for the future in terms of unrepresentative numbers on school boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are important in terms of adequate financial provision for local authorities and in terms of the democratic argument for parents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro (Dumfies)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was a little surprised that amendment No. 70 was promoted from its previous position on the amendment paper to this group of amendments. The costs of school boards are a separate issue from the question of whether we should have school boards at all. The point has been raised, however, so I must intervene. I am entirely with the Minister on the other amendments on whether schools boards should be compulsory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading I said that my regional authority of Dumfries and Galloway had gone into this matter in great detail. As the Minister knows, it had a constructive approach to this legislation, but it doubted that it could have a worthwhile school board system throughout the region costing less than £600,000. If one translates that for the whole of Scotland, it is obviously an enormous sum relative to the money resolution in the Bill. How does the Minister see the costs of the school boards relative to the support that the education authorities will receive from the Scottish Education Department? Will he cover the costs in full or will they have to find a large proportion of the costs of school boards from their normal resources?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate what the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) said. The Minister wants to keep down the size of school board membership, because the larger the board the greater the costs, such as travelling expenses and so on, but I agree with the hon. Member for Dumbarton that school boards with a total membership of seven, nine, 11 or 13, going up in steps per 500 pupils, are small boards. A board including only four parents representing a school of 490 pupils or five parents representing 999 pupils seems on the small side. When we consider board membership, we must look closely at the ratio of parents to staff members to co-opted members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document that the Minister kindly sent us at the weekend shows that we are looking at small numbers. Bearing in mind that not everyone is 100 per cent fit all the time, not everyone will turn up at every board
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
meeting. Some parents may live 40 miles away from where the school board meets. Membership by parents who live on the fringe of the catchment area may be inhibited because of travelling difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many matters relating to the number of members of the boards remain to be discussed. I appreciate that my hon. Friend the Minister feels that if the membership is kept down the cost will be kept down, but I think that the members' costs will represent a minimal proportion of the overall cost of school boards. I cannot see how board members are to do a worthwhile job and attend fairly frequent meetings—they will have significant executive power—without incurring substantial costs. There will be both administrative costs and travelling costs. Whether meetings take place during the day or in the evening, teachers will have to be allowed time off to attend or time off in lieu. The new system will cost substantially more than my hon. Friend the Minister estimates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like my hon. Friend the Minister to go into the cost in depth when he responds to the discussion about whether school boards should be set up or not and before we reach a conclusion. However, I assure my hon. Friend the Minister that I am in favour of school boards. I am not convinced by the counterarguments put forward by Opposition Members. Nevertheless, I am deeply worried about the cost of school boards, about who will pay for them and whether the Government will provide any of the money required.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly support what my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro) has said. I reassure my hon. Friend the Minister that I do not agree with the sense of amendment No. 69, nor with those who support it. However, I, too, am deeply worried about the cost of school boards. I am also worried by the paper that my hon. Friend the Minister has circulated about the regulations that the Government intend to make. I notice that he used the word "intention", and I am glad that the proposals are only intentions at this stage. I hope that we shall have a thorough debate on that paper and on the composition of school boards. I hope not only that we shall have the opportunity to discuss the parts of the Bill relating to membership but that local authorities and other organisations will be fully consulted about membership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am genuinely worried—not only on the grounds of cost, which I shall come to later—that in a school of one to 500 pupils, there will be only one staff member on the board. That will lead to a feeling of inadequate representation in this new venture, among teachers—not just among teachers' organisations. In schools near the upper limit—schools of, say, just under 500—which have a fairly large staff, an intolerable burden will be placed on the one staff member on the board. I do not intend to go into more detail about that now, as we shall have an opportunity to discuss it later. I simply want to give my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State notice that I have deep worries that the proposed membership will impair the effectiveness of school boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, to increase the number of staff members on the boards of schools with fewer than 500 pupils
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0801">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>87</span>
will have an immediate effect on costs. I believe that my hon. Friend the Minister has pitched the size of school boards too low in his paper. If the size is too small, the projected cost that my hon. Friend has supplied, based on that size, is too low. It would be proper at this stage of the debate for my hon. Friend the Minister to say why he believes that the cost will be so low. We should also like to know about potential conflict with outside groups, such as Dumfries and Galloway education authority, which has experience of such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are embarking on an exciting new venture. The consultation process has shown that it is broadly welcomed in Scotland, despite what the Opposition have said. It is certainly welcomed in the part of Grampian that I represent. We want a system more effective than school councils, although they have been relatively effective in Grampian compared with other areas in Scotland. It would be a tragedy if this new opportunity and structure were hindered, restricted or made ineffective because the boards were too small or because they did not have adequate resources to fulfil the task that the Government sought to give to them. If we support the structure in principle, it is important that it is properly financed. Therefore, I welcome the opportunity for a debate and shall listen carefully to what my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State says about his calculations and why they differ from those of outside groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In setting up the new system, we must know from where the resources will come. Will they have to come from within the local authority's existing budget, or will they be covered in full by funds from central Government or elsewhere? Only if we know those details, can we judge whether the new structure will have adequate resources to carry out its job effectively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Lewis Moonie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kirkcaldy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for speaking twice, but I had not realised that amendment No. 70 was included in this group. It is an important amendment, particularly in the light of the circular that the Minister has sent out since our previous sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like some other hon. Members who have spoken today, I was amazed to learn of the number of parents who will be involved. If school boards are to be set up, there should be adequate provision for representation for parents and staff. It is ridiculous for one staff member to represent many fair-sized schools. It is also ridiculous that three or four parents should represent the interests of many others. The Minister knows that it is difficult to get people to attend meetings regularly, and boards could be in difficulties because originally the numbers were pitched too low. It would be appalling if a quorum of two or three were to take decisions on behalf of others. It would be a recipe for small, unrepresentative groups of whatever colour or persuasion to take decisions in their own interests rather than in those of parents in general. I am sure that later we shall have an opportunity to discuss the boards' accountability to the body of parents as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are beginning to realise the number of boards being proposed by the Minister, and they are inadequate. Let us take Fife as an example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>88</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) asked specifically about the composition of boards and the numbers of teachers. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not wish to mislead the Committee. The size of the boards has always been made clear and was announced as part of our post-consultation response. We have always made it clear that the numbers would vary, according to the size of the school and have made apparent the overall size of the boards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the size will vary according to the size of the school, and it is fair and reasonable that a formula must be used because a board of 20 could not be imposed on a school with only 10 pupils. It does not require much intelligence to realise that the size of school boards will vary, but they should not be as small as four or five. That is too small a number, even in a small community. A small community gives many people an opportunity to take part in school affairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may read what we said in response to the consultation exercise that the Labour party says is a climb-down by the Government.

There will be a majority of 	<i>parent members</i> (up to seven depending on the size of the board), elected by parents of pupils at the school. There will be 	<i>staff members</i> (up to three) chosen by their colleagues; and there will be two or three 	<i>co-opted members,</i> chosen by the board."</p></blockquote>
The position has always been clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said "up to three", and that does not get away from the fact that in many cases it will be only one. That point is worthy of debate and question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the Minister is missing the point? In a school with between 1,000 and 1,500 pupils, six parents effectively could control its destiny and pupils. The Minister should accept my hon. Friend's argument that that could become dangerous and unrepresentative rather than saying that he has trailed the composition of the Committee for the past few months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. According to what the Minister said last week, the number of parents proposed—the original consultation document did not specify a figure—has been pitched too low and boards should be larger than those envisaged. That is the only point that I wish to make, so I cannot see why the Minister keeps rising. The Minister cannot possibly say that that was in response to the consultation document. It merely specified that boards should vary in size. I accept that, but I should like boards to vary between 10 and 20 members rather than between five and 10.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) and I represent the region of Fife, which has 200 primary, secondary and special schools, which will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0802">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>89</span>
entail an enormous number of board members. Those 200 boards will require clerical and secretarial support, stationery, printing, postage and members' expenses and a fair estimate of the cost is several hundred thousand pounds a year. Where will the money come from? Will the Minister insist that as this is Government policy the Government fund that expenditure? By the time that the boards are introduced we shall have a new system of funding local government. Those who have examined the effects of the poll tax and the percentage of increased costs know that that system will produce a proportionately large increase in the amounts that individuals pay. Although £500,000 may not sound like a great deal of money in terms of a region's expenditure, it will be added to other sums that legislation forces on local authorities year after year. There is an inexorable increase in costs and an unfair situation could develop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is incumbent on the Minister to pay due regard to the amendment and to outline his exact intention about the funding of school boards. He should say what he thinks the scheme will cost, rather than pluck a figure out of thin air. The figure will be much more than he has said. Where will the money come from? Who will have to pay for it? Will it come out of the poll tax or will it come, as it should, from central Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal briefly with the observations that have been made about costs. It is important to set up boards to bring a more democratic form of management into local school level. I am astonished by comments that because there will be only a few parents they will form some sort of cabal and be unrepresentative. The proposed system is the best description that I have heard of all forms of democracy. It means that a majority of people will vote for an individual, whether it be at district or regional level, or in Parliament. We are elected because a majority vote for us and we all represent many people. That system works well and it is astonishing that one can draw a line and say, "Somehow it will work at parliamentary level because it suits me, but it will not work at another level because it does not suit me." That is nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I happen to think that—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He thinks, therefore he is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Sedentary interventions, particularly of that nature, only encourage people and are to be deprecated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am accustomed to the peculiar humour that comes from certain parts of the Labour party in Scotland, which trivialises everything that matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The numbers for the school boards, at which my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has arrived, are right. We want to operate a system that will not be open-ended and will not lead to unnecessary costs, and it is right to contain the numbers. I could not disagree more with my right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) about the number of staff" members. The object of having a staff member present is to ensure that there is staff input into the board. That is quite proper, but it is important
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
to understand that the school will continue to be run by the headmaster and that teachers will continue to carry out their duties as required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The board's functions are clearly laid out and we shall be debating them at length in later clauses. It is important to recognise that the staff member is present to represent that level. That is reminiscent of the industrial scene where there is not more than one member representing a group of people who have a particular interest. That is the correct way to run the system. Parents have a primary interest in the school because of their children. Schools are there to educate children. It is right and proper that parents—

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may interest the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was merely responding to an intervention that suggested that, because we have a democratic election system, people will say that they prefer to elect someone else. I was simply drawing attention to the fact that that happens in every other sphere where elections take place, so it does not surprise me. It is important to recognise that staff members will have a right to be on the board and will have the additional value of the co-opted members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seems to be arguing a position for teachers that adds up to little more than tokenism. He says that they will have a place on the boards but will play a limited role, and that everyone

else on the board will be able to make decisions, but teachers must do as they are told. They will have no more than a token position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Knox. I do not mind you ruling my intervention out of order, but it was a direct response to the whole thrust of what the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) has said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point of order is taken. The Committee should realise that if an hon. Member strays briefly from the point and then returns to it, I shall not mind too much. However, if he continues to develop an argument that is clearly the subject of other amendments, it is my duty to draw the Committee's attention to it. Mr. Bill Walker.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why call him again, then?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One is accustomed to that sort of intervention, so one is not surprised. I hope that I was making it clear that I thought that the balance between the size of the boards and their cost was about right. I was merely elaborating, and shall be happy to do so in detail on later amendments. Teachers are not being given a token position—quite the opposite. The costs must be contained. We do not want an open-ended commitment, and I congratulate my hon. Friend on the balance that has been achieved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gordon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to clarify briefly the two points relating to the amendments. Except for the one which relates to cost, the amendments are trying to respond to the Government's stated objective of the Bill, namely, parent power. However, the Government are saying that parents who decide that they do not want a school board will be required to have one whether they like it or not, and that the board's composition will be predetermined by the Government, who require that parents must have a majority on that board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that we shall have an opportunity to debate that point at greater length later. Amendments Nos. 47 and 52 deal with that by allowing no group an effective majority on the boards. May I say in passing that I think that there will be widespread concern about the suggestion that only one teacher should be represented on the board in smaller schools. I concur with the right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith), who emphasised the fact that the Government's proposals are merely suggestions. I hope that the Minister will take that point seriously. The right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside and I represent two Grampian constituencies with similar compositions. Parents in our area said, "We want more say and we are critical of school councils in
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
the sense that we have less power than we would like." I fully support the case for more parent power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in many cases parents said that they did not want to take overall control. They want a partnership between themselves, the teachers and the educationists. The local group, Education Alert, which carried out much research into the opinions of parents' and others on the matter, came up with some useful guidelines in the form of statistics and one or two quotes that are apposite to the clause. Parents in my constituency said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Parents are transitory in the system and continuity with long-term vision for the future of education as a whole is necessary".</p></blockquote>
Many parents feel that they can make an important contribution and are anxious about their children's education. However, they are not educationists—it is not their job to run schools, and they do not wish to do so. While the wording of the amendments may be criticised, they are a genuine attempt to put across the idea that we must accept that parents want to shift the balance back to the education authority, rather than take that responsibility fully for themselves. I do not for a minute expect the Minister to accept the amendments, but I hope that he acknowledges that anxiety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 70 on costs, our previous sittings have made it apparent that the Minister's legislation may have opened a can of worms. The number of people involved, and the cost of support and administration for the measure, are beginning to make it look extremely bureaucratic and potentially expensive. I understand why the Minister would argue that that is one reason why it is necessary to keep the numbers small. I do not particularly wish to quarrel with him on that point, but I wish to quarrel with him over the balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having only one teacher on the board of a small school creates a distorted balance. The overwhelming majority of parents do not wish that and it undermines the idea of partnership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Various amendments could deal with that problem, for example, by allowing the head teacher a vote, thereby ensuring that at least two teacher representatives have votes. The composition of the board could be altered, as future amendments seek.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should show some sensitivity on the points raised. It is ironic that the Government's legislation has imposed obligations on local authorities to act on the Government's behalf. Those obligations add considerably to the administrative costs of local authorities. That is true of the community charge legislation and of the Bill. Yet, the Government impose cash limits on local authorities. The net effect is that, under all such legislation, local authorities will spend more of their money on administration and less on delivering services. That will be resented. The Minister should respond to the question of costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a long debate and detailed points have been raised. I shall deal first with amendments Nos. 69, 38 and 39, which would have the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0804">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>93</span>
effect of giving parents a right not to have a school board and would give education authorities the power to ballot parents on whether they want a board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, the Opposition repeatedly reiterated their conviction that parental involvement was a good thing. Indeed, in response to the consultation paper, the Labour party said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Labour party strongly supports the increasing involvement of parents in the education of their children."</p></blockquote>
In its submission, the Educational Institute of Scotland said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The EIS has long argued that the role of parents in Scottish education needs to be developed and that this is one of the areas in which the Scottish educational system is not pre-eminent and, indeed, lags behind the systems of other countries."</p></blockquote>
Even the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is a need for greater parental involvement in schools."</p></blockquote>
The great bulk of the responses to our consultation paper shared the conviction that something must be done to provide parents with a forum in the school system. When we suggested in our consultation paper that schools should be grouped, there were howls of protest from small schools around the country which demanded their own fora which the Bill provides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now we know what the Opposition really think when the rhetoric is stripped away. Practically the first amendment we debate aims to deprive parents of the opportunity to use that voice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will give way to the hon. Gentleman when I have finished my point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This group of amendments even includes a mechanism for raising apathy by giving local authorities a power to call for ballots against the setting up of boards. All this comes from the Opposition who told us on Second Reading that the Bill only paid lip service to the idea of parental involvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us look at the effects of the amendments. The Bill provides for the abolition of school councils. With this amendment, the Bill would also provide for some schools not to have a school board. How would that combination of provisions possibly help to increase parental involvement? Of course it would not. It would seriously reduce the opportunities for parental involvement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to see that the Minister is in favour of COSLA and the Labour party imposing solutions on ordinary people as we advocated on Second Reading. Can the Minister not recognise that the amendment allows parents to decide or whether they wish to have a school board as outlined in the Bill or whether they would prefer to carry on as at present? There is no question of the Labour party or any education authority denying parents what they wish to
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
see in their local school. The amendment enables parents to decide for themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has expressed support for the amendment. He must explain to his constituents how he has got himself into a position where he wishes to amend the Bill so that his constituents would no longer have a school council and it would be possible to remove any forum for parents within the school. How does he reconcile that with his criticism that the Government's attitude to parental involvement is superficial and that we are not serious in our provisions? That is a strange way for the Labour party to show "strong support", to quote their submission, for increasing parental involvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will the Opposition explain their amendment to the EIS which, commenting on the consultation paper, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The EIS accepts that the Scottish educational system is vulnerable to the charge that it has failed to respond to the need for a growing involvement of parents with teachers in the running of the schools."</p></blockquote>
The EIS did not advocate extending parental choice, but stressed the desperate need within the educational system for a forum for parents. The hon. Gentleman supports an amendment which would remove that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is deliberately trying to misrepresent the position of those of us who support the amendment. I realise that it has already been typed out and handed to the press as today's press release and that the Minister must stick to it, but he must not mislead the Committee. We are entirely in favour of school councils and parental involvement. The Bill would impose school boards on parents. We are giving parents the right to say whether they want the type of school board which the Minister proposes to impose on them. We argue that it should not be imposed upon them, but should be a matter for them to decide, not the Minister who does not represent anyone in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will have to do his homework. I have issued no press release. I am responding to points that were made in the debate. The hon. Gentleman has still to justify his position which seems to be changing. If he is worried that there is no mechanism whereby parents can choose whether a school board is established, he should look at the provisions in the Bill. There is no need to introduce a new procedure for testing parental interest in the establishment of a board. The Bill already provides in clause 20(5) that, where insufficient parents are elected, no board will be established. If there is no interest in providing a forum within the school and if parents do not come forward there will be no board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) was very concerned about the numbers of people on the boards. The Opposition seem to have changed their mind entirely on the composition of the boards. At our last sitting, the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) was quite savage in his attacks on the Government. He said:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0805">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>95</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister is optimistic if he thinks that he can find 25,000 people in Scotland willing to offer themselves for elected office. That is a remarkable proposition. I hope that his optimism is well founded. I should like to believe that it is, but, after a lifetime's involvement in elections of different sorts, I should be surprised if we do not find that, as with the school councils, there are simply not enough people available to do the work. That would be most unfortunate."	<i>[Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 21 April 1988; c. 70]</p></blockquote>
That is what the Opposition were saying at the Committee's last sitting. Now they are complaining that the boards are not large enough and that more people should be involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that we were making did not refer in particular to teachers. We are saying now that teachers' representation should be greater.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is a super optimist on the question of finding candidates, but that feeling is certainly not reflected in the Conservative party in Cumbernauld and Kilsyth, where the Conservatives have failed to field a single candidate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not be drawn down that road in order to release the hon. Gentleman from the difficulty that he has got himself into. At our last sitting he said that it would be difficult to find candidates for the school boards. Contrary to that, his hon. Friends have argued during this debate that the boards should be larger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce), to his considerable credit, made the distinction between the composition and size of the board. The hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) went so far as to say that this was the first time that he had heard about the size of the school board. He also said that there was nothing about numbers in our consultation paper, but the consultation paper says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Parents will have a clear majority of voting members. In addition, there will be one (or in larger schools, 2 or 3) representatives of the staff of the school and 2 or 3 co-opted members representing the local community. Thus the boards would have between 7 and 13 members, depending on the size of the school."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must correct the misapprehension that the Minister is under. When I talked about something being the first that I had heard of it, I explained clearly that I had not realised that clause 70 was part of the group of amendments under discussion. I never said that that was the first that I had heard about the question of numbers. I said that it was the first time that the Minister had specified the exact numbers of parent representatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister quoted comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) at our last sitting. There are two completely separate points involved. First, will there be enough public interest to enable school boards to function? Secondly, what size should a school board be to have adequate numbers of parents? Those are separate points, not the same. There is no inconsistency between our argument last week about whether people would be interested and our present argument about the size that a school board should be to function properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is obviously true. Unfortunately, the hon. Gentleman is associated with an amendment which argues that parents should be able to vote to have no school board at all. He does not take account of the provisions stating that where candidates do not come forward in sufficient numbers to fill the places for parental representatives on the school board, there will be no school board, and that there will be no school board until those places are filled. So a procedure is already enshrined within the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 25,000 members are not all elected. They include parents, teachers and co-opted members. The number of elected members will be rather fewer than half. The figure was an exaggeration, and I assume that it was mentioned on the principle of doubling the size of the school boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dumbarton and the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) who, regrettably, is not here, were worried about unrepresentative groups. The motivation for the amendment may be to provide a safeguard against school boards being unrepresentative, but there are provisions for that in the Bill and we made it clear in our response to the consultation process that we acknowledged that some protection was necessary. Under clause 12, there is a duty to report to parents and to consider their views. Under clause 13 the boards have a duty to respond to parents' questions, criticisms, open meetings and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 3 provides that the school boards will be subject to half their membership retiring on a two-year cycle so that there is an opportunity for parents regularly to take a view. Any question of taking delegated functions—further powers—is subject to a ballot by parents of the kind that the supporters of these amendments have in mind. No functions will be delegated without the support of the local authority. If the local authority is unwilling, the Secretary of State would become involved, his involvement being subject to a ballot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) who has now rejoined the Committee, has a point. I said early in our previous sitting that I do not envisage people standing under party labels as candidates for school board elections. The hon. Gentleman is worried that that will happen and says that it would be undesirable. If he cares to table an amendment, I should be willing to consider it carefully. However, there are provisions and protections in the Bill to prevent unrepresentative groups from taking control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that he would accept an amendment that would state specifically that members of political parties were excluded from seeking office on a school board? My experience of what has happened elsewhere in the country is that such bodies have become political largely because parents have organised to defend their education system against cuts. That has certainly happened in London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are increasing expenditure on education in Scotland this year by 9 per cent over last year, so I do not think that there will be much activity in defence of campaigns against cuts. There are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0806">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
protections in the Bill and I do not think that people will run as party candidates. If they do, parents will give them short shrift by not electing them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) and his colleagues are more regulatory in their instincts than are Conservative Members. If he or the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) feel that the Bill needs strengthening in this respect, they should table an amendment to meet the point instead of simply making assertions about what will happen. I have said that I will consider it carefully, because the situation that they have described is obviously one that we seek to avoid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for giving way again. He said that fewer than half the 25,000 members would be elected, but as each school board will have a majority of parents surely more than half the members will be elected. With regard to avoiding the election of unrepresentative parents, schedule 1 makes no provision for people to be nominated by others. Does the Minister intend that a proposal form should bear the signatures of a certain number of other parents, as in local elections, for example? That might help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Your approach to our discussions is tolerant, Mr. McWilliam, but I fear that if I began to discuss our plans in schedule 1 I should rapidly be called, to order. Perhaps the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) will wait until we reach schedule 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if I could be persuaded that amendment No. 38 was necessary or desirable—and I cannot—it would be unacceptable. It introduces the unique concept of the "parents of a school". If those who support the amendment would care to explain what such strange creatures would look like, I should be delighted to hear from them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of amendment No. 70 would be absurd. We should be unable to establish a system of school boards until we had convinced COSLA that we were providing them with sufficient funds. We have made it clear throughout that we disagree with COSLA's estimates of the costs of the implementation of a school board system. In response to our original consultation paper, COSLA began by suggesting a cost of £12 million per year. It then suggested £15 million, and now we are hearing suggestions that the cost will be £20 million per year. I do not accept that figure, but even if it were right, it would be a small percentage of local authority current expenditure in school. The various estimates from £5 million to £20 million range from less than 0.5 per cent to less than 2 per cent of that expenditure. The rate support grant for education for the current year was £1.676 billion—an increase of about 9 per cent.

The COSLA estimate is deficient in a number of respects. It ignores the savings from the abolition of school councils, and the fact that many local authorities are already working on systems to give cost and other financial information on a per school basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned savings from the abolition of school councils. Tayside's 32 school councils cost £600 each per year. The total cost per

board is £6,400 per year and there will be 160 school boards in Tayside, costing the authority £102,000. Where are the savings there?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the costings of the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) take into account travelling expenses, administration and so on. But whether the figure were £5, £500 or £5,000, the hon.

The hon. Gentleman may argue that costs will increase, but we are talking about savings. The expenditure on school councils will be saved when school councils do not exist any more. If any expenditure is involved, there will be some savings.

I hope that the hon. Member for Dundee, East will be patient, because my right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) asked me to explain the Dumfries and Galloway estimate in detail. The hon. Member for Dundee, East may be able to gain insight into the way in which significant sums of money can be involved.

COSLA has also ignored the fact that boards are unlikely to take on the full delegated functions immediately on establishment. My right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) asked me to be clear on that, and we have made it clear that we are prepared to discuss the question of costs with authorities and consider any case which authorities may wish to put forward in the context of the rate support grant discussions.

I am curious about the Opposition's position and I wish to be crystal clear about it. Are they arguing for a specific grant to fund school boards? If not, why were they not content with the assurance that was given when we debated the money resolution?

It is significant that hon. Members such as the hon. member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion), who have

	<span class='label label-info column'>99</span>
been bobbing up and down throughout the debate, sat on their hands on the question of a specific grant. If Opposition Members say that funds must be available for school boards they are arguing for a specific grant. Opposition Members have not jumped to their feet to answer my question because COSLA has fought tooth and nail against specific grants for specific activities in local government. They have argued that specific grants undermine local democracy, that the money should be provided as a rate support grant and that it should not be tagged to school boards. However, the amendment would create a specific grant for school boards to which COSLA is opposed, and which not one Opposition Member is prepared to say that he supports.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition have no lobby for a specific grant to pay for school boards. Will the Minister answer the question put by the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's comments take my breath away. He says that no one argues for a specific grant, but the amendment proposes a system of specific grants as a condition for the establishment of school boards. The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon.

We shall take account of pressures because we want the school boards to be a success. The hon. Member for Dundee, East, in pressing this amendment, is in conflict with the Government, COSLA and the position in local government for a considerable time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment requires that financial provision be made. I realise that Opposition Members are considered to be very slow, but can the Minister make it clear to the Committee that "taking account of" is not the same as giving a commitment wholly to fund the cost of the boards to regional councils? Will
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
the Minister say that the Government will wholly fund the net cost to regional councils of the school boards?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would mean identifying the expenditure and giving funds for that expenditure. Is the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If he wants us to identify the total expenditure involved and give that label to part of the money, he is arguing for a specific grant, which is not COSLA's view. But if it will keep the hon. Gentleman happy, I shall consider the idea, he having pressed it with such enthusiasm in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) asked me to give some detail about the estimates of Dumfries and Galloway.' I agree with him that it has done a magnificent job in responding to the consultation process and setting up its pilot board scheme. I do not know whether he wants me to go into great detail about costings, but I am happy to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Please do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with the estimates broadly. The issue can be pursued further if members of the Committee wish to take that course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The estimates provided by Dumfries and Galloway represented a sincere attempt to put a figure on the costs of school boards. However, the Dumfries and Galloway figure for boards' travelling expenses was grossly overestimated. It ignored the fact that many school council members do not claim their travelling expenses—this was made clear by the hon. Member for Dundee, East, and Dundee is probably a good example—and many school board members may also choose not to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Dumfries and Galloway estimates include a substantial sum for additional staff to respond to increased demands for repairs and maintenance. That is difficult to defend. I assume that the council was not suggesting that if boards notice and report a need for maintenance in their schools the costs of remedial action could legitimately be ascribed to them. Equally, I find it hard to believe that the board members and their existence will result in more repairs and maintenance being required. Perhaps the supposition is that they will break up the furniture!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we amend the council's estimates in the light of these comments and gross up the figure for Scotland as a whole, we produce a figure of £9 million, not £12 million, £15 million nor £20 million. Of that £9 million, £7 million of the revised total is for additional staff costs, which we believe to be excessive. It assumes that the education authority has to provide directly all clerical support. That is not correct. The Bill allows boards to make their own arrangements, even for board members to act as clerks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no provision for that within the present local authority structure. Staff members are

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a recipe for boards to make economical arrangements that suit them. I envisage that boards will have their own budgets to cover their administrative needs and will be able to make arrangements with local people, working on a part-time basis, to take the minutes. It is a matter for the boards; they need not have a vast, centralised support system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise that Opposition Members are incapable of thinking in any other way, but there is no reason why the boards should not make arrangements that they consider economical and that suit local circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is introducing a concept which, to say the least, is unfortunate. He is really saying that there can be two employers within an education authority—the education authority itself and the board. That is not possible. Education authority staff will not service boards that employ staff not covered by the National Joint Council for Local Authorities' Administrative Professional, Technical and Clerical Services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note what the hon. Gentleman says, but we are talking about school boards that will require a person to take the minutes and type and circulate them. I know that the hon. Gentleman always does his homework and, I am sure that he has studied the Bill carefully and knows that the Bill clearly provides for boards to make their own arrangements to suit local circumstances. We shall have an opportunity to discuss that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>[Interruption.]</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have already told the Committee that I do not like sedentary interjections.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) is getting upset about this, I remind him of our discussion of a previous group of amendments, during which he argued that there should be individual choice. The Bill provides that boards have a choice about their arrangements for administrative support, and I believe that many boards will choose the method that they consider the most convenient and economical. The assumption behind the Dumfries and Galloway costings is that all clerical services will be provided centrally by the local authority. That assumption is not necessarily correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a most extraordinary statement. The Minister is taking local education authorities into a completely new realm. It is a provision for amateurism, for a lack of professionalism, and for a
	<span class='label label-info column'>102</span>
lack of standards being set and achieved. Until now the basis of local authority employment has been to establish and maintain standards among officers. A century of work has gone into that and this legislation will undermine it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Civil Service would not put up with it. Why not have DHSS offices run by local volunteers? I suppose that that would appeal to the Minister and may come in future. I give this warning, and I mean it: local authority staff will not service committees where others undermine salaries and the standards of professionalism they they believe is important to the good running of local authorities. That is why I have tabled an amendment to ensure that clerks should be covered by the national joint council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No doubt we can discuss that when we reach that amendment. We are discussing clerical support for the boards, and the boards making their own arrangements. Tens of thousands of organisations throughout Scotland make arrangements for clerical support. It is absurd to say that a school secretary or local retired person doing the clerical work is unprofessional.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the hon. Gentleman pronouces on behalf of the local authorities, he should consider the representations that the local authorities have made. One of the points that they made in the consultation process was that they would find it extremely difficult to find the staff to go to every board meeting, which is why the Bill does not require that local authority employees be required to attend, but allows for them to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The input of professional advice, guidance and support will come from the authority, but we are discussing clerical support simply in the context of the cost. The way in which the hon. Gentleman wishes such support to be given would be by far the most expensive way of proceeding. As the boards will be free to make their own arrangements, they need not opt for the expensive choice that the hon. Gentleman seeks to thrust upon them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's contempt for Scottish education is well understood in Scotland. May I reiterate the serious point that my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth made? The Government are setting up an extensive apparatus of school board provision but, because they are unwilling to fund it properly, local authorities must respond by saying that they may not be able to start it adequately. Is the Minister saying that there will be a voluntary sector to service the board, even at clerical level, which is important to its functions? If so, that is an extraordinary statement. Again, it is policy formulation on the hoof, even though it merely concerns clerical provision. It is outrageous that the Minister can do that. We are making substantial points and he is not taking us seriously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman makes a serious point I shall take him seriously. If he finds that that is a great surprise, he should refer to the Bill and, more important, to the amendment tabled by the hon.

Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth about clerks. He will then see that the position is clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Dumfries and Galloway estimate is based on all the clerical support being provided centrally, but the Bill provides that the boards have a choice in that matter. The most significant overestimation arises from applying Dumfries and Galloway's figures for central support costs to Scotland as a whole. Strathclyde, which accounts for half of the boards-to-be, already has in place a financial reporting system which should be capable of answering many of the demands that will be made as a result of the Bill. So far as I know, Strathclyde regional council developed this system without specific grant or additional resources from the Government. It is to Strathclyde regional council's credit that it has developed those systems. It is absurd to presume that the school boards are adding to local authorities' costs because they require local authorities to develop management information and accounting systems that tell them the costs of individual schools. Part of ensuring value for money and using resources efficiently is to develop systems that allow individual school costs to be known. Indeed, Strathclyde has done that, so, to say that those costs arise from school boards is wrong. School boards will have access to that information, but any responsible and efficient education authority should have the system to obtain it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noticed the other day that the director of education in Lothian argued that the cost of school boards would be £500,000 in his area and that he would have to buy computers to service the boards. Computers already exist in schools in Lothian to provide the support for the management system. I believe that even Tayside has discovered the computer.

For the reasons that I have given, I hope that the Committee will reject the amendments. They would remove the opportunity for a forum that everyone agrees that parents require in education—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) will respond fully to the Minister, but I want to deal with the question of staffing the school board. The Minister's remarks have serious implications for local authorities, so we should discuss them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local government grew out of the systems of local administration that have developed over centuries. By the advent of this century there was an apparent lack of professionalism and standardisation in its various functions. Because of that, a series of arrangements
	<span class='label label-info column'>104</span>
grew up by which professional bodies regulated the standards of certain officials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
School boards clerks are not the same level of officer as the former town clerk or the present chief executive in local authorities. The Government were greatly bothered, got into a controversy, consulted widely, and drew up new proposals about school boards. Despite that, we have been told this morning that those boards are amateur affairs, like running the boy scout troupe, the boys brigade company, or anything of a social nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not the case. Those serving on school boards will expect a cetain standard of official to be present to give assistance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Gentleman's point that those serving on school boards will expect a certain standard and quality of service, but the Bill provides that the boards can purchase that service from the local authority or any other appropriate source. We are attacking not standards, but the idea that there should be a monopoly provider of services to boards that may result in some services being more expensive than they would be otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That depends on how one views local authorities. I do not describe local authority officers as monopoly providers of services. They carry out the instructions of elected bodies such as committees, just as in the House. I envisaged that one clerk would be clerk to several boards, would compile the minutes of those boards and do the letter writing on their behalf. The person providing that service would provide the board with the professionalism by which officers of local authorities lay great stock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware of the frenetic activity in the opposite corner of the room? The Minister seems to be trying to extricate himself from the even deeper hole that he has dug. Will my hon. Friend comment on purchase of services? A saga of voluntarism and amateurism seemed to be unfolding, but now the Government are saying that the boards may be able to purchase support services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is a sort of television evangelist for Adam Smithisms. I had chosen to ignore that cliché because I do not think that parents will see themselves as purchasing services from anywhere. They will see themselves as carrying out the board's functions as they relate to the life of the school. They will want to believe that advice about how far they can or cannot go will be available from the clerk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is changing his position. Throughout the debate, I have talked about clerical support for the school board. The board will need someone to write the minutes, to type, to photocopy material and distribute it to members of the board. For that, they will be able to make their own arrangements. Where boards take on further functions and responsibilities, perhaps as a result of further delegations from the local authority, they will require professional advice from the local authority. That advice will be forthcoming but will be quite separate
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0810">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>105</span>
from clerical support. It is a little mischievous of the hon. Gentleman to confuse those two things.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is wriggling about. I understood him to say that the board would be able to make whatever arrangements it wanted for clerical services. He talked about minute-writing, which is not a job for a clerical officer. The minutes of meetings of the board will be compiled by a clerk to the board. Is the Minister saying that there will be a professional clerk to the board but that clerical services will be provided by an amateur? If that is what he is saying, he is adding to the cost of school boards in a way that I certainly had not envisaged. Although school boards will not generate a lot of clerical work an officer with some experience of the workings of the education authority, its policies and its relationship with boards will be required to deal with it. That goes beyond the scope of a clerical officer's work. A better and more professional arrangement would be to have a clerk to several boards who would be one of the officers of the authority. That would be better than to use this important legislation, by which the Minister lays great stock and which has been the centrepiece of his ministerial activity since he became a Minister, to create amateur, hole-in the-corner organisations that will somehow run badminton classes or other such activities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is unfortunate that these two amendments, on conflicting subjects, have been debated together. I support the Minister's position on amendment No. 69 but as Dumfries and Galloway has been mentioned frequently I must further defend my local authority. The school boards will be statutory bodies, unlike bodies such as parent teacher associations, which are voluntary. The functions of statutory boards are very important. Their decisions have the force of law in consultation and cooperation with the education authority. There can be no fudging or saying, "Madge will write the minutes up today and Jock will do it tomorrow". It must be done officially with the proper procedure, which must be filtered into the education authority when action is necessary but is not to be taken by the board itself. It cannot be done on a shoestring, as my hon. Friend the Minister implied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to go into too much detail, but Dumfries and Galloway local authority is not daft. It has gone into the costing with tremendous enthusiasm to get it right. It costs £7,000 to run an election with 23,000 postal election documents. Travelling expenses are put at £45,000. Training for board members will not be necessary every year, but there is no point in having a requirement for a highly qualified school board if we are not prepared to give a little training. It may be in-house training, but that could still cost about £40,000. We must also take into account the replacement of staff when members have to attend meetings. It is a pity that we are not discussing cost along with board membership. Staff replacement costs are reckoned at £81,000. The service to school boards will be £18,000, allowing for administration, clerical assistance, employers' costs and administrative overheads. We also have to deal with central staffing—the finance department, property services and the
	<span class='label label-info column'>106</span>
educational audit all need to be considered. The Dumfries and Galloway local authority is reckoning on 135 school boards; goodness knows how many hundreds there will be in Strathclyde and other regions. The Dumfries and Galloway estimate is not pie-in-the-sky costing. The authority has gone into great detail to reach a figure of £568,404 for a year's running of school boards. I am not competent to do a mathematical calculation to translate that into a figure for the whole of Scotland, but the Dumfries and Galloway estimate suggested that it would be of the order of £20 million, bearing in mind the size of some of the authorities. In any case, it will be far in excess of the £5 million originally mentioned in the memorandum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such costs must not be brushed aside as being of little importance as though education authorities could assimilate them into their budgets without giving up other important projects. A sum of £600,000 in Dumfries and Galloway could mean the substantial upgrading of a school or even building a large part of a new country school, which is very important and which I should support. Such a sum could even mean additional support for transport costs in rural areas to provide a more frequent service. The costing of the school boards cannot be taken light-heartedly. It is crucial to the Bill and warrants a major debate of its own. It should not be attached to a debate about whether there should be school boards at all—I have already made my views clear on that issue. We shall return to the issue of cost when we debate the membership of school boards. Membership is relevant to the cost, which will depend on the size of each board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will have something more complimentary and helpful to say about the cost of school boards as it is important. Local authorities are thinking about cost as much as administration. Cost is important in almost everything that local authorities do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not got to the bottom of the issue, but I hope that we shall return to it. Perhaps the Minister will give us more information at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. The Minister tried to make great play of whether the amendment called for specific grants. If the Minister looks closely at the wording of the amendment, he will see that it does not call for specific grants to be made available for funding the new school boards. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The timing of the establishment of School Boards will be conditional upon adequate financial provision being made to education authorities to establish and support such Boards. The level of financial provision will be the subject of consultation and agreement with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities."</p></blockquote>
That could easily be achieved through the rate support grant settlement that the Minister has annually in consultation with the Convention of Scottish Local authorities. I hope that he will concede that, and forget his meanderings about specific grants being necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made great play of Tayside regional council's savings. I hope that he will concede that savings of £600 for each of the 32 school councils in Tayside makes hardly any impact on the great cost that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0811">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>107</span>
Tayside regional council will now incur by funding 160 school boards. The regional council estimates that the cost will be well over £100,000. Therefore, saving £600 a school does not matter. The council has detailed the costs of school boards, including many different factors, such as janitors' overtime. Fifty-five schools that do not have school councils will have school boards. School lets will have to be made available to allow those school boards to meet. That will involve additional overtime for janitors. That must be taken into consideration, along with the additional cost of heating and lighting. The council will have to institute a financial information system for school boards. The cost of that must be considered. Budgetary control—which will enable school boards to look after the budgets that they control—must also be costed. The Minister did not refer to that. School boards will eventually have rights to deal with staff appointments. Manpower service staff will have to advise boards on how to make such appointments. Those costs must be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will meet the additional cost to regional councils of establishing school boards.

The Minister mentioned that even Tayside had discovered computers. The Minister does not know much about Tayside. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) was in Dundee recently, when he awarded a computer to one of the primary schools there because of the school's excellence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my memory serves me correctly, Sinclair computers are made on Tayside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Timex, which is in Dundee, has a long record of producing computers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made a throwaway remark, but it was a serious point. He said that Tayside already has computers, so it would not need to buy any new ones. That is not so. The computers are already fully loaded dealing with the regional council's functions. Is the Minister suggesting that classroom computers be turned over to the school boards, denying pupils access to them? Perhaps that is what the Minister has in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If all school boards seek the delegated powers available to them under the Bill, they could be in charge of recurrent budgets. They would need computers to enable them to manage financial information properly. The regional council would have to monitor each of the 160 school boards and how they spent their budgets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are particularly worried by the Minister's reference to the proposal that school boards should have the choice of making their own arrangements for administrative, not clerical, advice and support. Under the Bill, school boards could become responsible not only for the recurrent budget but for staff appointments, the handling of the curriculum and the assessment of information that would be passed to them by regional councils and for examining closely the policies on rules, discipline and corporal punishment and so on. Those are matters
	<span class='label label-info column'>108</span>
for which the school boards could ultimately become responsible. It is essential that the standard of advice and support that they are given is of the highest quality. The Minister seems to be suggesting that they could look elsewhere for that advice and support by taking on part-time local volunteers to do it for them on the cheap. We would not tolerate that, and I am sure that Conservative Members would not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was worried by the theme that seemed to run through the Minister's remarks, particularly at the end of his speech. He thought that it was proper to undermine what he called the monopoly provider of services, the regional council or the education committee, and to privatise the running of school boards. That is what the Bill is all about. It has nothing to do with parental involvement. It is about privatising the provision of education, whether it be through the running of the school board or ultimately through the school itself by allowing it to opt out of the main education system and into the fee-paying, grant-aided sector, which has always been the Minister's intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can respond to some of the points that have been made, particularly those made by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro). I should not like him to feel that he must defend Dumfries and Galloway; we have considerable admiration for what that authority has done. How it ends up with a figure for the cost of school boards that is different to ours is an important question. I did not wish to burden the Committee with too much detail, but perhaps I could go into some of it. I undertake to write to my hon. Friend giving a full analysis, which he may wish to discuss with Dumfries and Galloway. There will be an opportunity under clause 17 to discuss the financial provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Worthington 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clydebank and Milngavie)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I am about to respond to my hon. Friend. The original estimate that Dumfries and Galloway made about the cost to its region was £592,404. It was based on a set of apparently reasonable assumptions about the administrative support that boards should need, but there are a number of flaws. For example, when estimating travelling expenses for board members, a rate of 44.8p per mile was used. That might be appropriate for the House of Commons. Moreover, the assumption was made that 12 members per board would claim expenses. The Bill limits the expenses that are paid to board members to the maximum of similar expenses prescribed under section 46 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. The current maximum rate for car use is 21.3p per mile. The average board size will be nearer nine. Substituting those more accurate figures in the calculation used by Dumfries and Galloway and grossing up for the 2,800 boards would produce a sum of £286,272, compared with a grossed-up Dumfries and Galloway estimate of £903,168. A difference of £750,000 arises simply from a mistake about the level of travelling expenses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: According to a document that I have, the mileage rate is 23p. Allowing for a slight

	<span class='label label-info column'>109</span>
increase because of inflation, by next year the figure represents 46,000 miles at 23p per mile. I do not know where my hon. Friend got his figure of 44 pence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend quotes a rate of travelling expenses which is paid for officials.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolute shambles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) shouts "absolute shambles", but perhaps he might listen to the arguments. The rate which my hon. Friend quotes is the rate paid to officials. The rate that I gave of 21.3p is the rate prescribed under section 46 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. It we operate on the assumption of an average of nine members per board claiming expenses, which is an over-generous assumption because the experience of school councils suggests that not all board members will claim expenses, we end up with a gross figure of £286,272. The Dumfries and Galloway estimate for travelling expenses is £903,168, so there is a difference of almost £750,000. Similar reductions arise from the application of the more accurate estimates to Dumfries and Galloway's figures for costs associated with training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The largest element in the estimates is £264,060 for staff to service directly school boards. The equivalent figure for that grossed up in Scottish terms is £5.5 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East believes that there will be no savings from abolishing school councils. The Dumfries and Galloway figure of £264,060 for directly servicing school boards is reduced to £180,240 by subtracting the cost of supporting Dumfries and Galloway's school councils. That figure is equivalent to £3.7 million for Scotland as a whole, as opposed to £5.5 million. On that estimate, the savings arising from the abolition of school councils would be about £1.8 million. But I urge the Committee to be cautious about the grossed figures. As I explained, larger authorities will benefit from economies of scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over one third of the Dumfries and Galloway estimate—£200,000—is accounted for by the cost of extra central staff. They are said to be necessary to provide budget information for boards, to undertake financial and educational audits and to advise and discuss policy matters with boards. The hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) is right to point to those staff as being necessary to support the school boards. We do not question the need for extra support and advisory staff in that area. I am simply questioning the figure of £264,060, netted down to £180,240, for providing clerical support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to refute the need for extra support and advisory staff, but it could be argued that there will be significant economies of scale in the larger authorities and that Strathclyde in particular, which has half the school boards, will benefit from the improvements that it has already made in its financial information systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final part of the Dumfries and Galloway estimates includes £50,000 for staff to deal with an expected increase in the demand for property repairs and maintenance. It seems entirely reasonable for boards to highlight any shortcomings in an authority's
	<span class='label label-info column'>110</span>
maintenance programme. However, it cannot be reasonable to attribute to the boards the costs of putting right the maintenance problems which have been discovered by the boards. That is what has been done in the Dumfries and Galloway estimates. The exclusion of that provision, which I am sure all members of the Committee would agree was unreasonable, gives a reduction, grossed up, of no less than £1 million for Scotland as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me reassure my hon. Friend that Dumfries and Galloway made a noble effort. The differences between our figures and those in the estimates arise from the assumptions which have been made. Some of the assumptions are erroneous and some are inappropriate when taking into account the costs of school boards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is all very well the Minister criticising other people's estimates. When will we get the Minister's own breakdown of what the costs will be for each school board and what he believes to be an appropriate budget for school boards of different sizes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall no doubt discuss that matter. The hon. Gentleman asks when figures will be available. I started my remarks by pointing out that our estimate was equivalent to 0.5 per cent of local authority education expenditure—about £5 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman rebukes me for criticising the Dumfries and Galloway authority, but I am not criticising it. On the contrary, I believe that it is extremely enlightened. It has done far more than any other education authority in Scotland in pressing ahead with the school boards pilot scheme and in making constructive suggestions to the Committee. Members of the Committee have asked me to justify the difference between our estimate and that of Dumfries and Galloway. I have done so. The differences are not intended as a criticism. The assumptions made were reasonable but there are differences in approach and assumptions, and I am sure that the Committee will accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it would help the Committee if the Minister could provide another example of a change in local government where the costs were in line with the Scottish Office's original estimate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised by the posture of the hon. Gentleman and his party. The Labour party usually argues that local authorities should spend more money. In this debate Labour Members are saying that our estimates are wrong because we have made false assumptions. Unable to find one argument to support that suggestion, the hon. Gentleman is now falling back on the argument that local government spends more than people expect. I do not wish to trespass on the territory of my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West, the other Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, but I suggest that the community charge may alter that phenomenon, which we have all observed over the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall write to my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries in detail and there will be an opportunity for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0813">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>111</span>
further discussion. We have given a clear undertaking that we do not want school boards to fail because they are inadequately resourced or supported, and we are prepared to commit through the rate support grant the resources necessary. I believe that that is the fifth time that I have said that in Committee, and I hope that the hon. Member for Dundee, East will now be satisfied. I cannot put it any more clearly. I hope that my hon. Friends will reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been a wondrous morning. We have seen the Minister's flagship holed repeatedly. Everyone in the Committee agrees on the importance of parental involvement in schools. Today we are being asked questions that remind me of programmed learning texts. The first question is, "Are you in favour of parental involvement?" Everyone says, "yes". The next instruction is, "Proceed to question 2", which is, "Are you in favour of the Minister's scheme, another scheme or are you a 'don't know'?" If one chooses any other option one is told that one is wrong, but when one finally presses the button for the Minister's scheme one is congratulated on arriving at the right answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not believe that that scheme is the most effective form of parental involvement. Parents should be offered the choice of that scheme or another. They should have the freedom to turn it down. A few years ago Strathclyde offered parents the right to be involved in appointments of senior teaching staff, by sitting on appointment boards. Overwhelmingly, to our astonishment, parents said that they did not want to do that. We accepted their right to say that and, with regret, changed the scheme. Under the Government's system that would not be possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can illustrate what is wrong with the scheme by pointing out that nursery schools are excluded. If one had to choose one area of education for which to make an extremely powerful case for parental involvement one would choose nursery schools. That would be saying, "We must get it right from the start". But the Government scheme of alleged parental involvement does not include nursery schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the Minister would have done himself and his party a great deal more good in Scotland if he had brought forward a scheme to place nursery education on a statutory basis and make it available to every child whose parents want it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Member goes too far down that road, that does not arise from this clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It links to my next point. We hear a great deal about choice, but the most fundamental choice is whether a service exists or not. A nursery education service does not exist for many people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been much debate about the real cost of these proposals. We are inhibited by the lack of a detailed breakdown of the alleged savings of school councils and an explanation of what school boards should do. We are given the global sum of £5 million,
	<span class='label label-info column'>112</span>
but no indication of how that sum is made up. Clause 10(4) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The School Board may make representations with regard to information, statements and reports provided under this section to the education authority and to the head teacher who shall take account of those representations and shall reply to them."</p></blockquote>
That is one of the most important clauses. It provides for parental involvement and a link with the education authority that should take into account the representations made by parents and the school boards. That task should not be accomplished by a person who is happy enough to produce the minutes because it is a professional task. If we are serious about school boards, we should ensure that they are properly serviced and managed. Hon. Members have referred to the need for extra staff to accomplish that task.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have severely underestimated the impact of this proposal on school administration. Already it is a matter of dispute with most education authorities that the administration of schools—their ability to duplicate and produce minutes and teaching materials—is under-resourced and will be stretched further. The Minister has made constant reference to the savings that will be made by the abolition of school councils. Last Thursday he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I can offer the prospect of salvation for the term "school council", because it might be possible to use both names. The hon. Member for Dundee, East knows that school councils have been umbrella organisations, which have brought together feeder primary schools and secondary schools in each area. … there is no reason why local authorities could not use their existing powers to continue to operate umbrella organisations."—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 21 April 1988; c. 64–65.]</p></blockquote>
I agree with that; it will be essential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of school councils' functions will not be done by school boards. Non-attendance at school has been by far the most time-consuming, onerous task of school councils. Anyone on the school council's attendance sub-committee is not short of work. Local authorities must decide how they will continue to deal with that work as the Minister has explicitly ruled out that task for the individual school boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the powers in the Bill is the setting of local holidays. There is no sense in local holidays being set by individual schools. It is important that primary schools and the secondary schools that they feed have similar holidays. It is necessary to have a forum to decide that. That is not a massive task, but it should be done in the locality and not by individual schools. Again, in the community use of schools outside hours, there is sense in having a harmonious, coherent policy between one school and the next.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
School councils deal with some very big issues. Local authorities have rightly said that they want to involve local parents in deciding the catchment areas of schools. That cannot be done effectively by one school and I hope that the local authorities will continue to involve parents in consultation. Some forum is needed to do that. The same applies to exceptional transfers of pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I jotted down those four or five aspects of work done by existing school councils. They are not referred to the new school boards, so the local authorities will have to pick up the responsibility. They may decide that a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0814">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>113</span>
conglomerate of the school boards is the right way to deal with those issues effectively and maintain parental involvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister threw out his offer—spontaneously, off the top of his head—last Thursday that school councils could be maintained, was that an offer to the local authorities to maintain them at their own expense if they were just going to be an ad hoc grouping in the area? Or was he saying that he recognises the kind of duty that members of school boards should undertake as part of their involvement in the area and that it would be useful to maintain that forum among schools in a locality?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we thought that it was a necessary condition to establish umbrella organisations, we might have considered including them in the Bill. I said that it was up to individual local authorities to take a view in the light of representations and discussions with the school boards. It is for local consideration and it is for the education authority to decide, but no barrier prevents them from doing so. The comment was made in the context of whether the term "school councils" could continue to be used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Roughly translated, I interpret that as saying that the local authorities will not be recompensed for the expenses that they will have to incur as a result of the abolition of school councils and the substitution of school boards. There will be a continuing expense and I suspect that it will be similar to the current expense borne by the local authorities for running school councils. Alternative procedures will be necessary, and they will be at least as costly. I say that because in some cases the work that in the past was done voluntarily by members of the school council will in future have to be done professionally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear from what the Minister has said that in estimating the cost of school boards, the continuing or extra expense of the school councils will not be taken into account. The difficulty in what he has said is that agreement between this Committee, the local authorities and central Government on the expenditure of setting up school boards is essential. At no time, in this Committee or elsewhere, have the Opposition suggested that there should be a specific grant. That is not in our amendment. What we are saying, with the utmost force, is that we do not trust the Government when they say that they will recompense local authorities for school boards' expenses. The only way that we would be reconciled to that would be if the Government spelt out in detail the real cost of introducing school boards and proved that they were being realistic about savings to be made by abolishing school councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members do not consider that the Government are being reasonable or have costed the scheme properly. If we believe in parental involvement it is crucial to introduce school boards in a thoroughly professional and successful way, otherwise we shall have the worst of all worlds—boards will not be formed and members will realise that the Government are getting their services on the cheap. Members will be
	<span class='label label-info column'>114</span>
expected to write the minutes and give a great deal of their time without proper recompense or the boards being properly serviced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister believes in choice, people should be allowed to choose their form of parental involvement. The Government seek to cut expenditure on education in many authorities. The Minister gave that away when he referred to the poll tax—there will be a different system and that will sort out the authorities. It will sort out expenditure on education, because between 50 per cent and 60 per cent of regional authorities' expenditure is on education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If local authorities and parents choose to support school boards, they will be forced to pay for them in preference to other educational expenditure, as the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro) pointed out, because the Government will not adequately recompense local authorities. Therefore, it is crucial to push the Minister for an explanation of the real costs involved. Speedy negotiations must be held with the local authority in Dumfries and Galloway and with COSLA to find out the real cost of the proposals. We need to know that school boards are to be set up in a manner that adequately equips them for their task rather than the kind of social club enterprise encouraged by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government say that the school board can choose how it services itself, but it cannot. It will be given a budget which will only enable it to perform its duties in an amateurish manner. It will not be given a budget that will allow it to be properly serviced and to work effectively. Those are the reasons for moving the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Section 1 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 places a duty on every education authority to secure for their area adequate and efficient provision of school and further education. That duty is placed on the elected councillors who are accountable to their electors for ensuring that an adequate and efficient local education service is provided. In practice, councillors discharge that duty through the chief officials of their authority—the director of education and his or her
	<span class='label label-info column'>116</span>
staff. The elected members decide the policies and the criteria or guidelines to be applied locally to ensure that education is provided adequately and efficiently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is then the duty of the officers to ensure that the policies passed onto them are implemented as elected members wish. In the Scottish education system there is a clear line, not so much of command as of responsibility. At the top of that line is central Government—the ultimate and central authority for administering the education system throughout Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is central Government's responsibility to ensure, through statutory enforcement, that no matter where pupils live, they are able to attend local school and to avail themselves of the opportunities provided by a national education service administered locally. That is the apex of the line of responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At local level, the education authorities of the regional councils are immediately responsible to local electorates for administering the national system locally. They must do that in line with the wishes of local electors as expressed through the ballot box and in line with the requirements that central Government lay upon them.

After the education authorities of regional councils comes the next tier of the administrative system in Scotland—the school councils, as they exist until this legislation is implemented. It is clear that the constitutions of school councils have been carefully drawn up by regional councils to ensure that the school councils carry out their functions in line with the clear criteria that have been established for them by their superior bodies—the regional council and, above that the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tayside regional council has produced a report, which deals with what it sees as a clear threat to that line of responsibility—from central Government through regional councils to school councils or the new school boards. The report argues that education administration involves three stages—policy formulation, policy implementation and policy evaluation. Once those three stages have been implemented, the cycle is repeated with policies and practices being reformulated, re-implemented and reevaluated. The report shows that that happens at all tiers of education administration and involves the committee and staff of the council and, indeed, of the schools. That being the case—I am sure that it is, as the report comes from educational experts—it is not hard to understand why education is so expensive.

Where such a complex administrative structure exists, we must be careful in spelling out the detailed extent of the functions at each tier of that structure. The Tayside report says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"otherwise management breaks down and confusion results".</p></blockquote>
It says that that usually happens when a subordinate tier does not operate within the constraints set by the superordinate tier. The report has been written in bureaucratic language by a regional council official. "Subordinate tier" means the school board, and "superordinate tier" means the regional council and the Government.

Tayside regional council warns that under the present arrangements, education administration would rapidly break down if, for example, the regional council were to ignore the local constraints placed on them by the Government. It points to the need to clarify the limits placed on each tier in terms of education management and administration, so that all three tiers make up a practicable totality and a workable system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report goes on to make it absolutely clear that the moment a subordinate body, such as a school board, ignores, in whatever way, a superior body such as a regional council, administrative chaos will ensue. The theme of the report is that, if the basic structure of educational administration in Scotland is to survive, the principle of each subordinate tier's functions being closely defined and in line with the tiers above it must be maintained. Otherwise, the schools and the pupils will suffer.

When we consider the powers of school boards under the Bill, we must establish from the beginning that they are subject to the same overriding statutory provisions as the education authorities. Whether the boards' actions are undertaken as agents of the authority, or whether they confer liability on the authority or directly affect the provision of education by the authority, the boards must be accountable to the education authority within the terms of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, to clarify the roles of the school boards and the education authorities, the Bill should include a
	<span class='label label-info column'>118</span>
statement setting out the statutory position of the boards, and put their public and legal accountability in context. That is why, in the view not only of members of the Committee but of COSLA and other bodies, the amendment should be accepted by the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I have always been concerned that, in introducing the new school boards, we should not cause confusion over the proper management lines for the conduct and administration and education in schools and the link between schools and the education authorities that oversee them. If we become confused about those management lines, it will not be in the best interests of education or of children. School boards are a step forward, but if they cause confusion over the management and administration of education—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
