</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We now enter the murky depths of part III—an important part of the Bill and one that I find totally unsatisfactory. The Government's stated objective of trying to give the tenants greater choice is laudable so far as it goes as a guiding principle, but under the Bill all that we are doing is giving landlords new rights. The Bill produces a new right to buy which mirrors the 1980 provisions, which gave power to tenants to purchase their own council houses. The right in this part of the Bill gives landlords a right to buy, and the framework of the Bill means that tenants will have precious little choice about what is happening to them. They are being treated as compliant observers and passed around betwixt landlords almost like mediaeval chattels. In my view, the Government have got the formula substantially wrong.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 990</span>
I accept the principle of increasing tenants' choice. In that respect, I may differ slightly from Labour Members of the Committee. I understand that they have a greater commitment to the role that public sector landlords have played historically and should play in the future, and I make no complaint about that. There is a case for looking carefully at giving tenants increased choices, even if that means in certain circumstances taking them out of the hands of public sector landlords. But I should be willing to consider moves in that direction only if those moves resulted in tenants moving towards tenant co-operatives or housing trusts, which would be essentially non-profit-making, mutual and co-operative organisations in the full sense of the word.<br><br>
The Bill does not go nearly far enough in that direction. If it did, I should find it easier to support. As it stands, it is impossible to support. Today's debates on that principle will be important. Far from the Bill providing tenants' choice, it really provides nothing more than Hobson's choice. In the course of discussing these and other amendments we shall see the problems that will confront tenants. When references were made to part III of the Bill at earlier sittings, hon. Members were talking about the "pick-a-landlord" scheme, but the equation is the other way round landlords will be picking tenants under part III, and it is regrettable for that if for no other reason.<br><br>
My principal objections are many. I am opposed to the proposals as they stand. First, it is regrettable that approved private landlords will be able to approach public sector landlords so that the tenant can be transferred to the private landlord—with the tenant having to agree to the move, of course, but on his own having absolutely no formal right to initiate the transfer process. That is a regrettable omission in the Bill.<br><br>
Secondly, present public sector landlords—islands and district councils—will have no rights to have tenants transferred to them from another public sector landlord, nor will a tenant have the right to seek a transfer between public sector landlords, for example, from a housing association to a district council. That is also objectionable.<br><br>
Thirdly, during the transfer process I can find no provision in the Bill for a continuing process of consultation between the tenant involved in the transfer and the other parties to the transaction. After agreeing to start the transfer, which is essential, the tenant will have no further input until asked to agree on the final terms of the transfer, which is obviously another legal necessity. In between times, there is no provision anywhere in the Bill for information to flow between the parties to the legal transaction of the tenancy and the tenant himself.<br><br>
Fourthly, it is objectionable that tenants involved in a transfer will not have access to properly resourced independent advice as of right. Tenants may therefore not be fully aware of other options available to them or of the implications of the transfer itself.<br><br>
I wish to illustrate my arguments by reference to the Shetland islands council area. It is instructive, because it will inform the debate and it was one of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0624">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 991</span>
the major reasons behind amendments Nos. 579 and 580. The Scottish Special Housing Association has been trying to effect the transfer of certain SSHA houses and tenants in Shetland to the Hjaltland housing association. The transfer proposed has been under consideration for a full five years; it is nevertheless still incomplete. That is instructive in itself. One of the main causes of the difficulties, which illustrates another intrinsic reason for the amendments, is that the Shetland islands council has been considerably hampered by the fact that the SSHA conducts all its negotiations and decision taking in Edinburgh and therefore people who try to deal with the SSHA, including tenants, find it difficult operating at arm's length. That reinforces the arguments that we heard earlier for a proper regionally based system of decentralised management and operations in the newly formed Scottish Homes. It is important to bear that in mind because it is an important factor in the situation in Shetland.<br><br>
Although the proposed transfer is under existing legislation, it is relevant to the consideration of part III of the Bill because it highlights the problems and concerns of tenants subjected to the implementation of transfer policies as proposed by the Bill, whereby tenants will have extremely limited rights and powers to participate in the transfer negotiations. Under part III a tenant will have a right to consent to the commencement of the transfer negotiations and an ultimate right to agree or refuse to agree to the transfer when it is to be finalised, but the tenant will have virtually no other right to participate in or be kept informed about the transfer negotiations.<br><br>
There are several disturbing features about the position in Shetland. First, the negotiations have been unduly prolonged according to the evidence that has been made available to me. A five-year period is far too long. They have been equivocal, and I am surprised about that because the SSHA, by and large in my experience, has been an exemplary body when facing up to difficulties in the past, certainly in my constituency. But in the Shetland islands it has also been unduly secretive.<br><br>
Secondly, the complaints that have been made to me show that tenants have not been kept fully advised of all the options that are open to them. The options that are open to them will be closed when the Bill is enacted. That is unfair on SSHA tenants in the Shetlands.<br><br>
The local authority has not been kept fully advised of the transfer proposals, which is deeply regrettable. As the previous factor of the 140 tenants and tenancies involved in the row, it could have played a constructive and fruitful role in bringing about a satisfactory outcome. Neither the tenants nor the local authority have been formally advised that a transfer of tenants is an available option or, alternatively, one that is excluded. Again that is regrettable.<br><br>
In addition, there are signs that, if a transfer of tenants in stock to the local authority is approved, the stock price will be based on a market value of approximately £3.5 million, which is considerably higher than the likely price based on an outstanding
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 992</span>
debt of approximately £1.5 million if the stock were transferred to the housing association. That is an important factor that we must consider in the context of what will happen in the future under part III.<br><br>
The results of a formal consultation, which had a deadline of 31 January 1988 and which sought the views of the 140 affected SSHA tenants on the proposed transfer to the housing association have not yet been published by the SSHA. Nothing has been said for the past month, although tenants and the local council are anxious to know about the eventual disposition of their tenancies.<br><br>
The tenants have not had any comprehensive and independent advice on the transfer proposals. Such advice as they have received arose as a last resort and out of desperation from the lcoal authority's intervention.<br><br>
That catalogue of complaints causes me considerable concern. Even with the SSHA in its present mode, which I consider to be a failry user-friendly organisation, a row that has been going on for five years has recently come to a head, and everybody is left perplexed, distressed and uncertain about what is going on—that is, under the current regime, in which there is more flexibility. That augurs ill for what will obtain when part III hits the statute book.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 579 and 580 seek to address the problem that we experienced recently in the Shetland Islands council, and which we shall experience day in and day out when part III is enacted. All members of the Committee will have to get used to correspondence on this subject arriving in bulk in their constitutency post bags if the Shetland situation is translated more widely under the Bill.<br><br>
The amendments are designed to respond to the Shetland row, but their currency goes well beyond it and could enable the Government to redress the balance and give tenants more say in the consultation process leading to transfers. I may say in parenthesis, having studied last night the provisions in part III of the English Housing Bill, that the Minister could legitimately say that we should be grateful for small mercies. If anything, the English provisions are far worse than those in this Bill as regards tenants' ability to have some say and input into the transfer process.<br><br>
The purpose of the amendments is clear from their texts. Amendment No. 579 suggests that two thirds of tenants must agree to proposed transfer of tenancy before the part III provisions come into force. I accept that two thirds is a fairly arbitrary figure. One could argue about simple majorities as opposed to two thirds majorities. I would not want to quibble about that.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson <span class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Proportional representation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman reminds me, perhaps there should be a single transferable vote in a multi-member tenancy. I suspect that that would defeat the numeracy that is available to Scottish Homes and the Scottish Office, but that is another matter.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0625">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 993</span>
Amendment No. 580 takes a slightly different perspective and explicitly specifies some of the rights and protections to which tenants should rightly be entitled during consultation and transfer.<br><br>
The spirit of the amendments is extremely important. I accept that the drafting and technical detail may be defective, but, having now spent some time studying the Shetland situation, I am deeply concerned about future prospects under part III. Unless the Minister can satisfy me that we are missing something in the Shetlands, members of the Committee would be well advised to take note of what has occurred there, in view of what might happen in the future. If the Minister is not prepared to put in Part III explicit rights of consultation and make sure that the transfer process allows tenants more formal opportunities, it will be impossible for him to make the Bill just, sensible, or even workable, and there will be mounting and increasing uncertainty among tenants. Again, the Government's object of increasing tenants' choice will be rendered null and void, which will make housing law in Scotland, complicated as it is, much worse.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) said that we could expect a great deal of correspondence about the one-way transfer of houses that Government have in mind, whereby a landlord will be able to put in a takover bid for somebody else's house. Provided that he can entice tenants by whatever means to sign on the dotted line—one can envisage all kinds of high-pressure salesmanship—he will be able to take over the property, and, overnight, tenants will cease to be protected and will become so-called assured tenants, with all the insecurity that has been debated.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman said that we could expect to receive a great deal of correspondence about it. He is right. It took me by some surprise when, 10 days ago, an envelope with a Lerwick postmark arrived on my breakfast table. The letter was from someone who was greatly concerned at the prospect of his house being transferred over his head, without consultation, from the Scottish Special Housing Association to the Hjaltland housing association. I do not want to say anything critical about the Hjaltland housing association, which I am sure does an excellent job, but the principle is that such people are under threat of having their homes sold to a housing association without being consulted.<br><br>
It is understandable that some of them would infinitely prefer to carry on working with the Shetlands district council, which has been factoring and managing their houses for many years. It seems the most logical progression, but the Government want to shut off that option. They say that the shift in tenancy may move only from the public to the private sector. We will debate that matter in greater detail later, but the "pick a landlord" principle, with which the Government are toying, is no more than a gimmick. It will solve none of the underlying problems in Scottish housing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with everything that the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 994</span>
Robertson) said. However, I wish to persuade him to stop using the pithy phrase, "pick a landlord". It will be the other way around—the landlord will pick the tenants.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The tenants will get picked off. "Pick a landlord" is common currency in connection with this provision. Tenants are being given the impression that they have a choice. However, I accept that it is a pretty one-sided choice, and I shall try to refrain from using that phrase, even though it rolls nicely off the tongue. I want to know what is happening in the Shetland Islands, because what happens there is crucial to the Government's future policy. If they are prepared to allow the SSHA to do a cosy little deal behind closed doors, whereby a significant number of tenants' houses will be transferred without consultation, or with only hasty consultation after the deal has been agreed, what is to happen in the future?<br><br>
On 18 February, I received a written reply from the Scottish Office to a question that I put on this worrying matter. The Minister said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Shetland Islands council has recently written to the Scottish Development Department indicating that it wishes to discuss whether appropriate arrangements could be made for the transfer to it of SSHA houses in the Shetland Islands. I wish to give full consideration to the particular circumstances of this request and to the views of all the interests concerned, including the SSHA as owners and the tenants. I am not, therefore, in a position to indicate our likely response to the inquiry from Shetland Islands council."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 18 February 1988; Vol. 127, <i>c.734.</i>]</p></blockquote>
That was some days ago. The Minister has had some time to give further consideration to the matter, and that consideration is relevant to the Government's policy, which, presumably, has been thought out, although that may be an over-generous assumption. Someone in the Scottish Office must have given some thought to how the proposal will work, so perhaps the Minister could tell us something about it. Clearly, it is a significant matter, from the point of view of tenants in the Shetland Islands and elsewhere in Scotland.<br><br>
There is an overwhelming case for ensuring that SSHA tenants and others should be able to give their approval before their homes are transferred. Under the rest of part III, for future transactions that is to be done. We shall debate the nuts and bolts of that matter later. It is possible that the SSHA might be able to force this through in relation to this transaction. That is not a satisfactory way of dealing with people's homes. It confirms the fears that were raised in connection with the original consultation documents published last May, which had phrases about Scottish Homes becoming a temporary landlord organisation—a sort of transit camp through which tenants would have to pass on their way to the private sector, whether or not they liked it. As the Minister knows, that caused a great deal of alarm among SSHA tenants, who were not prepared to be treated in that way.<br><br>
As the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire said, we should be grateful for small mercies. Part III of the Bill is not as bad as the relevant parts of the English Housing Bill, and I should not like to goad the Minister into doing what his colleagues in the Department of the Environment
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0626">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 995</span>
are doing. Nevertheless, there is suspicion and concern at the highly significant sequence of events unfolding in the far north of Scotland, in the Shetland Islands. Tenants there might be viewed by the SSHA as a bit of an anomaly in an awkward outpost.<br><br>
We know that the Shetland Islands council has been managing and factoring those houses for a long time. I honestly do not know whether it is doing a good job, or whether the Hjaltland housing association would do it better. However, the one thing that is absolutely clear to me is that individual tentants in the public sector should have some say in their choice of landlord.<br><br>
To return to the "pick a landlord" phrase, if the Minister is honest in suggesting that he is giving choice to tenants in the Bill and in the actions leading up the the enactment of the proposed legislation, he should make it clear to the Committee that tenants in the Shetland Islands will be able to opt to go into the housing association, to transfer to the Shetland Islands council, to buy their own houses or to transfer to another landlord altogether. If the Government are in earnest about giving choice to tenants, they should put a stop to negotiations behind closed doors.<br><br>
I have the same dossier as that mentioned by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, about the sequence of events over the past year in connection with negotiations an rumours about what is to happen to the SSHA houses in the Shetland Islands. I do not want to go into the details of what sounds in some respects like a slightly squalid story. The Shetland Islands councils action is a glowing example of how an elected local authority can stand up for the people whom it represents, be they landlords or anybody else. That body does not like the sound of what is happening; it wants to give tenants the option of going into the Shetland Islands council housing department if they so wish.<br><br>
We shall return to the basic principles of part III when debating future groups of amendments, and in the clause stand part debate. This part of the Bill is a pure gimmick that is advanced by the Government. It will not deal with any of the underlying problems that afflict housing in Scotland. There might have been case for a measure of this kind, if grotesquely inefficient, stubborn and hidebound local authorities badly managed housing. However, that bears no resemblance to the true state of affairs in Scotland today. Local authorities of every political complexion—though I admit that there are not many Tory ones—are leading the way with diversifying tenure in Scottish housing. Authorities such as Glasgow district council are promoting co-operatives, housing associations and home ownership, and they are encouraging private sector landlords also. They work with any agency that is available to try to deal with the underlying problems of housing in Glasgow. One could make the same point about Edinburgh and about the Shetland Islands council. Local authorities are responding to the challenge created by the housing crisis in Scotland. At best, the measure now proposed by the Government will confuse the issue, and, at worst will make life a lot more difficult for many tenants. It could trap them into insecurity, high rents
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 996</span>
and all manner of difficulties which could lead to increasing homelssness and other problems.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) for having given notice that he would raise the case of the Shetland Islands. The hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) said that he feared that the SSHA might be able to force this through. There is no question of that, that is entirely the wrong interpretation.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire outlined the local considerations of, and the practice that has arisen in, the Shetland islands. It would be wrong to draw from this case any conclusions about how the general tenants' choice will work in practice.<br><br>
I wish to clarify the position of the Hjaltland housing association. There is no question of SHHA tenants being transferred to the Hjaltland housing association against their wishes. The wishes and rights of individual tenants will be fully respected. The SHHA, contrary to what the hon. Member for East Lothian suggested, has carried out a careful and detailed consultation with all the individual tenants so that the options available to them can be explained. I emphasise, however, that there is no question of those tenants who have said that they do not wish to transfer to Hjaltland being required to do so.<br><br>
I do not accept that the Shetland exercise shows that tenants' choice will not work effectively in practice. The results of the tenants' consultation have only recently been submitted by the SSHA to the Scottish Development Department and the implications are being considered with great care. It is important to note, however, that special circumstances apply in the Shetland case. The proposal to transfer SSHA houses to other ownership has been under discussion for many years because of the problems of managing the comparatively small number of tenancies at a considerable distance.<br><br>
The Shetland islands council recently wrote to the Scottish Development Department stating that it wished to discuss whether appropriate arrangements could be made for the transfer to it of SSHA houses in Shetland. As the hon. Member for East Lothian said, the gist of my parly answer a few days ago was that I wished to give full consideration to the particular circumstances of that request and of the views of all interests concerned, including the SSHA, as the owners and tenants have all responded to the inquiry from the Shetland islands council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I urge the Minister to give full consideration to this as quickly as possible. If he delays until after the Bill is enacted, it will become illegal for these houses to be transferred to the Shetland islands council. Under the provision that we are about to consider, local authorities will be legislatively precluded from being receiving landlords under the scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect, the matter relating to Shetland islands council is not governed by clause 51.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0627">Image</span>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It will be if you take too long.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause extends rights and opportunities to tenants throughout Scotland, but the situation is not governed by it. Before action could be taken, the SSHA would have to receive the consent of the Secretary of State.<br><br>
It is probably necessary to clarify at an early stage of the debate that the Bill does not rule out transfers of stock to public sector landlords. Such transfers will not be possible under the terms of this legislation, but the Secretary of State for Scotland has powers under section 12(7) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 to approve disposals of local authority houses in the circumstances that we have been discussing. We do not seek to be dogmatic. I do not rule out my right honourable and learned Friend the Secretary of State approving transfers to a local authority under these other provisions if he were convinced that it made practical sense to do so and the tenants were in favour. We do not see tenants' choice as the appropriate vehicle for such transfers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths <span class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like the Minister to clarify this, as I may have misheard him. He said that a section of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 gave the Secretary of State powers to approve the disposal "of local authority housing. Did he mean disposal "to" a local authority?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, in certain circumstances, it is not ruled out, and the Secretary of State has powers to approve. Clearly, it would be with the consent of the Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To approve what?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To approve transfer of stock to public sector landlords.<br><br>
The hon. Member of Roxburgh and Berwickshire fairly made the point that more choice is laudable as far as it goes. He expressed doubts about the formula. The gist of what he was saying was along the lines of what Professor Maclennan stated in <i>The Scotsman</i> on 21 December. It is fair to say that Glasgow is the largest public sector landlord in western Europe. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Glasgow is by no means the worst landlord in Scotland—it's probably about average—yet in the 1985 housing conditions survey which has just been published, you find that 54 per cent. of council house tenants would prefer to organise their own repairs. That suggests a fair degree of unhappiness. I think that if groups of people do take the decision to transfer, however, then the hope is that they will opt to tranfer to housing co-operatives and associations rather than private landlords."</p></blockquote>
That fits in with the thinking of the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire. I see housing associations and co-operatives playing a key role in the matter. The Bill will allow Scottish Homes to approve co-operatives and trusts as receiving landlords.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire also said that landlords will be picking tenants. It is true that it will be possible for landlords to approach tenants, but the tenants will have to agree—that is the basic safeguard. The tenant also has a right to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 998</span>
initiate proceedings, but the procedures have to involve a prospective new landlord making the formal application to purchase under sections 51 and 53.<br><br>
The hon. Member also asked about the right to independent advice. The Department will give guidance in an information campaign in due course. Scottish Homes will also give impartial advice to tenants when requested to do so.<br><br>
I find it strange that amendment No. 579 should seek to place severe limitations on tenants of SSHA property in their exercise of the rights in this part of the Bill, simply because, before the legislation came into force, the SSHA had come to an agreement with a local authority that the authority would factor the SSHA's houses on its behalf. Such factoring agreements are in many instances quite the most sensible arrangement for the SSHA to adopt. The tenants remain tenants of the SSHA. Under the provisions of the Bill, SSHA tenants—or tenants of Scottish Homes, as they will become—will be able to exercise tenants' choice. So will local authority tenants. Therefore, I cannot understand why tenants of SSHA houses, managed by a local authority, should be able to exercise tenants' choice only if a large majority of the tenants involved agree.<br><br>
Tenants' choice is about individual tenants exercising a new right. The Bill does not envisage any vote taking place among tenants in any other circumstances. I see no reason to move from that position in the case of SSHA tenants. I hope that the hon. Member will reconsider his position on this and withdraw amendment No. 579.<br><br>
I am not attracted to amendment No. 580, which would put in place a formalised system of guidance and consultation. It is neither necessary nor desirable to enshrine this requirement in regulations. The provisions of this part of the Bill will not force any tenant to enter into any arrangement to change his landlord unless he so wishes. If he is contemplating transfer, it will be for him to ensure that the conditions that he is being offered by the prospective new landlord are acceptable.<br><br>
I can see that tenants might become confused. That is why we intend to issue guidance, as we did on the right to buy, on the provisions of the Bill, seeking to answer many of the questions that tenants will almost certainly want to ask before they decide whether to exercise their new rights.<br><br>
Scottish Homes will also be available to assist tenants on such matters, in addition to exercising its wider role on approvals and monitoring. I repeat that the provisions of this part of the Bill will not force tenants to change landlords, and the ultimate decision to transfer will be for the individual tenant.<br><br>
Nor do I think that it would be sensible to include in the statute any requirement that the factoring landlord, in the circumstances described, must be consulted during the process of arranging individual transfers. As a part of normal good management, the SSHA, to whom the application would be made, would expect to inform the factoring local authority. I see no reason why the arrangements that work successfully where tenants wish to exercise their right

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 999</span>
to buy should not also work for tenants' choice applications.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire did not speak to amendment No. 498, so I shall not go into that. The amendments to which he spoke are unacceptable, however, and I hope that he will be persuaded to withdraw them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall ask the Minister a couple of technical questions. I am still confused about the use that he sees being made by the Secretary of State of his powers under section 12(7) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987, which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Notwithstanding anything in section 27(1) of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1959 … a local authority shall not, in the exercise of their powers under subsection (1)(d), sell or lease any house or any part thereof to which the housing revenue account kept under section 203 relates except with the consent of the Secretary of State".</p></blockquote>
I may have misunderstood the context in which the Minister referred to that legislation. He left me with the impression that this would allow transfers between public sector landlords, with the consent of the Secretary of State, in exceptional circumstances. My interpretation of that part of that statute is that it does not mean that at all. It would be helpful to the Committee if the Minister would clarify that. He may well take the view that if the trasnfer process is to take place, the Bill may not be the appropriate vehicle. I understand and accept that, but I want clarification of what other powers exist outside the Bill. I also want to know to what use the Secretary of State could be expected to put any such other legislation in the context of the new situtation with Scottish Homes. If there are other provisions that may make a difference to the process of transfer or the rights or obligations in the transfer of tenancies, the Committee should know and be aware of the Scottish Office's expectations about other provisions in other legislation that may impact on this question. That is a detailed point and the Minister may need some time to answer it, but we need an answer before the end of the discussion on part III.<br><br>
I have another technical question. The Minister talked about local authorities factoring SSHA houses. I assume that a factoring arrangement is a contract that is entered into on an annual or triennial basis. Does the process of transfer give the power to the new landlords to break that factoring contract within the terms of the contract? Would the local authority have the right to financial redress if that factoring contract were interrupted by a process of transfer? Alternatively would they all have to wait until the end of that factoring contract before the process of transfer could take place?<br><br>
I do not want to make any more of the Shetlands situation. I simply wanted to place on record that that situation augurs ill, and the Government must learn lessons from that process. Will the Minister give an assurance that there will be a full review of all that took place? The hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) was right to say that it has come to a head quite recently, but it has been dragging on for five years, and I want an assurance that once the dust has settled and the decisions have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1000</span>
been taken, the Minister will get his officials to look carefully at what took place and learn the lessons, so that they can be put to good use and the benefit of that experience brought to bear on the new legislation.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
The hon. Member for East Lothian is quite right to say that consideration of this must be speeded up. The suspicion in the islands is that the SSHA is deliberately dragging its heels until the Bill is on the statute book, when the rights, duties, liabilities and opportunities will all substantially change. I want an assurance from the Minister that the decisions will be taken well in advance of this legislation being brought into operation. I am virtually certain that that will be the case. I cannot believe that the SSHA would deliberately go out of its way conspiratorially to delay matters in order to have recourse to the provisions of the Bill. Four weeks is a long time for decisions to be taken, and that matter should be brought to a speedy conclusion.<br><br>
What the Minister said about co-operation was interesting. I am not suggesting that he is disingenuous, but I should be more inclined to be sympathetic to this part if I felt in my bones that Scottish Homes would go out of its way to promote, to put resources into promoting and put experts into the field to promote the idea of non-profit-making housing co-operatives. In view of the history and track record of the Government, I do not believe that they will devote the necessary resources to achieving that end. Therefore, I remain unconvinced that the thrust and effectiveness of the Bill will be to move in that direction. I am convinced that the Government will go much more heavily into promoting profit-making landlords at the expense of the rights of the tenants. The Minister's assurance that Scottish Homes will promote leaflets and information about options and choices is difficult to take seriously because it will not be in a position to advise individual tenants of their best option. The facts and circumstances of each case will, by definition, be individual. There is no use posting a leaflet on two sides of A4 in glossy colour with a picture of the Minister or the new chairman or both on the front.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Woodstock should be on it, too.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That does not begin to measure up to what is needed. What is needed is an expert who will sit across a table from the tenant and spend the best part of an hour or an hour and ahalf rehearsing exactly what is facing him. If he went to even a provincial lawyer, who would charge very reasonable Law Society rates, he would get no change out of a hundred quid. The urgent need if the Bill is to work to the interests and benefit of the tenants is for consultation and information to be dispensed at an individual level by experts, and any amount of glossy leaflets will not measure up.<br><br>
I hope that we have learnt the lessons of the Shetland islands council and I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0629">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1001</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman talks about glossy leaflets being circulated by the SSHA. I understand that, on 18 December 1987, a letter was circulated to the 140 SSHA tenants in the Shetland islands council saying that they had until 31 January to decide whether to accept the transfer to the Hjaltland housing association, which caused confusion, despondency and, indeed, alarm. I understand that the matter has progressed because of the intervention of the Shetland islands council—and rightly so.<br><br>
I have found the example of the Shetland islands council interesting because, earlier in our debates, we talked about people's difficulties in constituencies such as mine in contacting the SSHA. In a town such as Dunbar, which is not that close to Edinburgh, the case with which a tenant can report complaints has not been ideal, and we are worried about the prospects for contacts on a larger scale with Scottish Homes. That is a much larger, centralised, national, public sector landlord. Goodness me, we can see from the Shetland islands how things could become much more difficult. I understand that there are 140 SSHA houses up there, most of them in Lerwick and four in the community of Hamnavoe. How on earth does one get from Hamnavoe to mission control in Glasgow or Edinburgh to deal with problems? That illustrates the problems that will be inherent in Scottish Homes as a national quango, and the case for keeping genuinely locally-based public sector landlords to whom tenants will have direct access.<br><br>
There is no point in repeating all the arguments. I hope that the Minister has learned something from the mistakes that have undoubtedly been made in the Shetland islands council area. I hope that there will be proper consultation with tenants at all levels about this transaction and that no one will be forced into a different type of tenure without being properly consulted. I hope that that is not an indication of what could happen in the future under the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In response to the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood), I must say that clause 2(e) empowers Scottish Homes:
<br><blockquote><p>"to provide or assist in the provision of advisory or other services or facilities for any person".</p></blockquote>
That is obviously a very important provision, along with the development of co-operatives. Scottish Homes will continue to have the statutory duty, which now lies with the Housing Corporation, to promote housing associations. The Housing Corporation has been well to the fore in promoting co-operatives.<br><br>
Factoring will be by contract, and the future arrangements for factoring will need to be considered in the circumstances described by the hon. Gentleman. I would expect the SSHA, and eventually Scottish Homes, to deal with those issues effectively.<br><br>
With regard to section 12 (7) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987, I set out the position quite clearly in my first remarks, but I repeat that this relates to the disposal of local authority housing. It can include disposals to other public sector landlords. Under the current formal agreement between the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1002</span>
Secretary of State and the SSHA, the Secretary of State's permission would be needed before any sales took place, and that arrangement will continue with Scottish Homes. The power for the Secretary of State to approve a move from the SSHA to a local authority will therefore remain after the Bill comes into force.<br><br>
I appreciate that the Shetlands issue should be dealt with rapidly, and I shall endeavour to take steps along those lines in response to representations from hon. Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am bowled over by the force of the Minister's reply. I beg to aske leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At the outset I should say that it is most unlikely that this amendment will be withdrawn, whatever the Minister may say. Amendment No. 490 extends the definition of "approved landlord" in subsection (1) by adding "public sector landlord". That means that a public sector landlord could become a receiving landlord in terms of the "pick a tenant" provision. I use that phrase in view of the point made by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood).<br><br>
The other amendments in the group are all connected with the general principle of amendment No. 490. Amendments Nos. 291 and 534 remove the exclusion of local authorities from the list of persons by whom the rights may be exercised in clause 52 to make it clear that a local authority could bid to acquire rented accommodation in other sectors if it wanted to.<br><br>
Amendment No. 496 inserts a reference to local authorities in the relevant list in clause 52. Amendment No. 292 states that all district and island councils are deemed to be approved receiving landlords. Amendment No. 514 inserts a reference to public sector landlords in clause 53 to establish a procedure for them to serve notice of a takeover
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0630">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1003</span>
bid to other landlords. Finally, amendment No. 534 inserts a reference to public sector landlords into clause 60 to waive the duty of Scottish Homes to consent to a disposal of property acquired by public sector landlords.<br><br>
The principle of what we seek to achieve is simple. The amendment aims to give tenants of public sector landlords and approved landlords equal rights when choosing a new landlord. The exclusion of public sector landlords from becoming receiving landlords undermines the declared objective of tenants' choice, which the Government keep going on about. If wide-scale choice is to be available to tenants in the public sector, they should not be denied the right to choose their local authority in preference to their current landlord.<br><br>
Equally, if tenants of approved landlords are dissatisfied with their services, they should be able to have a true choice and transfer to another landlord, either another approved landlord or a public sector landlord. It is as simple as that. If the Government want tenants to have a choice, let them have a real choice so that they can move in any direction, from the private to the public sector or from the public to the private sector.<br><br>
We have spoken about SSHA houses in the Shetland islands. I want to refer briefly to SSHA tenants in East Lothian. I have attended a number of meetings with SSHA tenants since the publication of the Scottish Homes consultation document. The Minister knows that considerable alarm was aroused among tenants about the fact that they were about to be transferred to Scottish Homes as a kind of transit camp to the private sector, whether they liked it or not. The Government have backtracked on that threat, and we are thankful for that.<br><br>
One thing that came through clearly from my constituents in SSHA housing in Musselburgh, Haddington, Tranent and Dunbar was that if they were to be shifted at all, they would like to have the option of transferring to the East Lothian district council housing department. That is understandable. Many of them live in houses in the same streets as district council houses. Many of them live in houses identical to district council houses on the other side of the street or further down the street. Over the years, it has been a point of controversy that there may be identical houses in the same street, some owned by the district council and some owned by the SSHA, and that the SSHA tenants have to pay substantially higher rents. It is not surprising therefore that those SSHA tenants would like to transfer to the district council, which tries to ensure that rents are kept at a fair level, and to provide a service at least as good as that provided by the SSHA.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
Surely tenants who have clearly expressed a preference to move to the local authority under the Government's proposals should have that option. The Government are terrified to give that option to tenants in the public sector. They want to set up the mechanism whereby private sector landlords can try to pick off tenants in properties in the public sector
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1004</span>
in Scotland, giving inducements to persuade, cajole or bribe tenants to make that move. One can understand the attraction to the landlord; he would build up his estate with property which might be of growing value. He would be in a stronger position than the former public sector landlord because of other provisions in the Bill. He would be able to take advantage of the assured tenancy system to shove up rents and reduce the security of his tenants so that he could make more money, and whenever he wished he could get vacant possession of his property and sell it off. We know what some of those people are likely to do.<br><br>
Clearly the Government fear the likelihood of the public sector in Scotland expanding if there were a genuine free market in tenants' choice. The Minister knows that a significant number of both private sector and SSHA tenants would, if they had a real choice, be likely to opt to move to their local district or islands council, which they knew thay could trust and over which they would have some control in the future. The fact that the clause would prevent private sector housing moving into the public sector exposes one of the fundamental flaws of the Bill. The Government are frightened that properties could move from the private into the public sector. If they felt so confident that people in Scotland were longing to get away from public sector tenancies into the private sector why have they put this non-return valve into the legislation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Arbuthnot <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wanstead and Woodford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman read the article in last week's <i>New Statesman</i> entitled:
<br><blockquote><p>"Labour authorities make lousy landlords"?</p></blockquote>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be useful if the hon.

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a pity that the hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot) missed the opportunity to visit Edinburgh, which was run for nigh on 100 years by a Conservative council which lost control in May 1984, and which I can confidently predict will not regain control in the May elections. If he had come up prior to 1984, he would have seen that the degree of tenant dissatisfaction with the council was so great that it translated itself into the private sector, and the private sector was so sympathetic that it elected a Labour council as well.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I share my hon. Friends confidence that Scotland's capital will remain in Socialist control for many years to come. I shall not pursue that matter at this stage as we are rather pressed for time.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1005</span>
The hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford is quite right to say that there are problems in the public sector. No wonder that is when we have a Government who will not allow public sector landlords to do their job. They are not allowed to invest in upgrading their housing because of restrictions on housing support grant and rate fund contributions, which force up rents. That sort of inferference from Whitehall in housing management in local authorities in Scotland is inevitably causing problems.<br><br>
If the hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford could leave the rarefied atmosphere of greater London and come to Scotland to see the work that is being done by Scottish housing authorities, he would find spectacular initiatives towards diversification in housing. Glasgow district council is the biggest public sector housing authority in the whole of western Europe. As the hon. Member presumes to vote on the legislation that affects our people in Scotland, but not his people in Wanstead and Woodford, it might be useful for him to see what is actually happening in the nation that he is voting about. He would find, for instance, that Glasgow district council is taking a wide range of initiatives to promote co-operatives which are taking over public sector housing stock, to promote housing associations, to encourage private sector landlords—and why not—and to encourage a wide range of diversification. That is happening under the present system in Scotland, without any of this legislation, and one wonders why the Government want to interfere in that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arbuthnot</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that the principles and practices of the Labour party north of the border are different from those south of the border. He may be right, but is he suggesting that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am talking about housing policy in Scotland, which is what the Bill is supposed to be dealing with although, as I said in my very first speech in the Committee, I find it bizarre that we have two members of the Committee who are taking part in debates and voting on issues that cannot possibly affect them or any of their constituents. It is becoming abundantly clear that they do not understand the position in Scotland. They do not understand the effect of the legislation, or its background. It is an abuse of the House. It is an abuse of Scotland, but we do not want to go over that point again.<br><br>
If the Government are so confident of the attractions of the private sector, surely they should not need to put a legislative block on. If they are so keen on tenants' choice—on a tenants' charter—and on diversification in Scotland, why are they inferfering with a system where a wide range of diversification is already taking place? That is being done quite freely on the initiatives taken by elected local authorities in Scotland because they know what is best for their people and they want to help their people develop in the best way for the local community.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1006</span>
Why do we have this eternal interference from Whitehall by people who know little, and care less, about what is happening in Scottish housing? There should be a choice, yes, that is true, but I think this part of the Bill is a gimmick. It is quite irrelevant to the underlying problems of housing in Scotland and it will not deal with any of the real difficulties. The restriction that the Government have built in to this gimmick exposes the thing for what it is—a complete charade. If the Government really want to have freedom of choice, with landlords swapping houses all over the place and tenants being free to move from one landlord to a housing association and back again, that is fair enough, but they do not want that at all. They want to favour the private sector. This has everything to do with the political dogma of the Conservative party. That should be contrasted with the pragmatic approach taken by all sorts of local authorities in Scotland.<br><br>
The Government have been found out and if they had any shred of honesty about the Bill they would accept the amendments, which will not only enable public sector tenants to move into the private sector but allow the reverse to take place. If they had the courage of their convictions, they would do that, although I suspect that they would not like the results, because it would mean an increase in the public sector in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall make a short contribution to this important debate. My name is attached to amendments Nos. 291 and 292, which seek to underline what the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) has suggested—that the option of a tenant transferring to a local authority should be admitted under the Bill.<br><br>
The Government are embarking on a dangerous course if they do not allow the principle of being able to move into a public sector tenancy. If the Bill is not amended, the suspicion will be that the Government are antipathetic to local authorities per se and in principle. That would be regrettable, because it need not be the case. I realise that the Government have had difficulties and that some local authorities are less than perfect landlords, but the Government should have the confidence to make that choice for themselves. Tenants would be unlikely to exercise choice in the direction of a local authority landlord if he had a bad reputation, and some have. Some have bad reputations for good reasons; some have bad reputations because they have not woken up to the new needs of housing management.<br><br>
Like the hon. Member for East Lothian, my view is that the whole discipline of housing management has recently come on by leaps and bounds. The amount of training and academic input into the subject over the past few years is very encouraging. The new breed of housing manager is more committed to diversity and to making the system more efficient than some local authorities have been in the past 10 or 15 years. Local authorities have not had to seek far for their troubles. Some landlords who have a bad reputation, for instance because they take a long time to respond to complaints about repairs, have had that thrust on them from Governments of both views. No doubt, if one went
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0632">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1007</span>
back to the days of Lloyd George, one could find Liberal examples of bad landlords too.<br><br>
If the Government's principle is to increase choice, it is badly damaged by their not allowing tenants to move into the public sector. That would not happen to a great extent, but it should be allowed to happen. The Government should have the courage of their convictions and allow tenants to make up their own minds in that respect too. It would not destroy the aims and objectives set out in the other parts of the Bill, even part III. The situation would develop perfectly reasonably if transfer into the public sector were laid down in the Bill. I do not understand what the Government's fear is or what they are seeking to do.<br><br>
I do not usually make extravagent political claims, but I fear that there is an element of ideological conviction that the Conservative Government have set their face against public sector landlords. The tenants themselves can make that choice and are making it by moving, in appropriate circumstances, out of the public sector. The Governments actions also have a psychological angle. Local authorities now feel not only that their strategic role is being taken away from them, but that, in proposals like these which deny them equal treatment with the private sector, they are being discriminated against. The Goverment must be careful about that, because there is a problem of morale in the public sector as well. Many of the new, young managers who will make a substantial contribution to improving the situation in Scotland may start looking for private sector employment in order to develop and deploy their skills, if they come to the conclusion that the Government have set their face against public sector landlords in principle and for ideological reasons, and I would deeply regret that.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
Allowing transfer into the public sector would not destroy the aims and objects of the other parts of the Bill. Why not give it a run and see how it works out? If the Government then felt that it was inimical to their interests and to the principles behind the rest of the Bill, they could later take a different view. They should let it run for five years and see what happens. I do not understand why the Government have decided to move in this direction. The explanation can lie only in party politicial motivation, which is a bad basis for legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 490 and 291 hit the ideological bull's-eye, because they focus on the dishonesty behind the Governments claim that the Bill opens up fredom of choice for tenants. It is not genuine freedom of choice if this important avenue is closed. I believe firmly in freedom of choice. Most of the members of the Committee, if not all of them, have exercised their freedom of choice to choose the form of housing that suits them. I see no need for any of us to deny prospective or existing householders in Scotland that same freedom.<br><br>
We must look closely at the Governments motivation. Something disturbs me about a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1008</span>
Government who seek to stamp out opposition in this way. It is clear that they are heavily biased against the public sector, but that bias is so heavy in some of the provisions in Bill that it suggests that they are afraid of the public sector. The Government refuse, for example, to leave the door open to tenants who find that the private sector, or even Scottish Homes, is not to their liking and give them the option of transferring back. That belies any of their claims to give Scottish tenants genuine freedom of choice.<br><br>
In previous debates I talked about incentives. What incentives are there for tenants to transfer? I believe firmly that if the true consequences of a transfer out of the public sector were made clear to tenants, very few of them would take up that option. I listed previously the rights which will be limited or lost to Scottish tenants. I am seriously concerned at what we are about to unleash on the Scottish housing market, if the Bill goes through as it stands. In the first place, we would unleash private sector landlords who, to use the Minister's own words, will pick tenants. In the debate on the previous amendments he said that landlords would approach tenants. That worries me considerably. Landlords will seek considerable investment opportunities in acquiring these properties from local authorities and will be persuaded to make approaches to tenants in the same way as a car or encyclopaedia salesman or an insurance salesman. I am concerned about the unscrupulous landlords. Because of the laxity in part I of the Bill, which gives Scottish Homes no continuing power or control over approved landlords—it simply has to approve them and does not have the power to chase up contracts to see whether landlords are implementing the promises that they made to tenants—landlords will have the freedom to approach tenants and persuade them with all kinds of promises and inducements. It is difficult to speculate on what these promises and inducements will be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McAllion <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that in South Wales one landlord is trying to persuade tenants to pick him as a prospective landlord by offering them foreign holidays in Majorca or Ibiza?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is his address?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire may be in the public sector. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) for pointing that out. There is a real fear that, because of the profits that will be made by the removal of rent controls and phasing, which is promised in the Bill, there will be opportunities that landlords will be unable to resist because they will be far too tempting for anyone who wants to make money out of the market. The people who will suffer will be the existing tenants, who will be persuaded by fair means or foul that they should change landlords and choose the one who makes these promises and commitments. There will be no way to check and ensure that the landlord has fulfilled these commitments. If tenants say to the landlord, "You haven't fulfilled these commitments. We want

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1009</span>
the modernisation scheme that you promised us. You didn't tell us you were going to increase the rent to this level", the Government have cleared that path too. Troublesome tenants can be removed easily and simply under the Bill. The protections that were previously available to secured tenants will disappear when the transfer takes place.<br><br>
This is a con—an attempt to persuade people in Scotland that they are being given rights, when they are not. There is no genuine flexibility, if one excludes the possibility of returning to the private sector. The tenants thereafter will have no right to question the private landlord; there will be no leverage for the tenant to exercise in such cases. For that reason, I support the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) asked why there was a need for tenants' choice in the context of the provisions of the Bill. A good example is that of co-ops? Already, much progress has been made in this connection without the legislation. The disposals to co-ops require both the Secretary of State's approval and the co-operation of the local authority. The Bill extends rights to tenants to transfer, whether or not the local authority agrees.<br><br>
The hon. Member for East Lothian raised the question of SSHA tenants in Dunbar. He suggested that they might wish to transfer to the local authority. As yet, a great many tenants in Scotland have not had the option to form their own co-operatives or housing associations or to have those possibilities fully explained. It is not therefore surprising that they see their choice as only the SSHA or the local authority. We wish to extend their opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You do not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do, under the Bill. The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) raised the question of landlords approaching tenants and investment opportunities. The safeguards are that each transfer would require the tenant's approval under clauses 52(1)(b) and 55(2). Secondly, the first disposal of property transferred will require the approval of Scottish Homes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What genuine safeguard is there against the landlord offering inducements such as those mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion)—free holidays or even cash in hand? That is not a genuine safeguard.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Tenants have an immense amount of common sense and can see through people offering them opportunities that are not genuine. An advice service will be laid on by Scottish Homes, as I said earlier.<br><br>
These amendments are not acceptable. One of the nights that the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South raised is that of the right of tenants to have meetings. There may be some confusion in his mind about it. For housing associations, section 105 of the Housing Act 1985 provides that in England and Wales landlords of secured tenancies have the duty to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1010</span>
inform secured tenants who are likely to be substantially affected by matters of housing management of their proposals regarding that matter and to enable tenants to make their views known. This duty is to be discharged by holding meetings; that is one of the statutory rights.<br><br>
Whatever the pros and cons of this point, it is irrelevant to Scotland, because there is no equivalent of that section in the Scottish Housing Acts. It has not formed part of our tenants' charter, for reasons that were fully debated during the passage of the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act 1980. The hon. Member was relying on an English provision, possibly without realising that it does not exist in Scotland.<br><br>
I have some sympathy with him in this connection, because the position in Scotland is different. One main reason was that we incorporated a right to a written lease in our tenants' charter, which was not done in England and Wales. Both this and a statutory right to consultation were recognised as potentially placing a large additional burden on housing authority staff resources. There were strong representations that a combination of both rights would be an unbearable burden. I thought it as well to clear up that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I recall a number of debates on the written lease. I was not confused about the Scottish legislation. I was trying to impress on the Minister the necessity for formalising the agreement between landlord and tenant. I raised the point when we were discussing the short assured tenancy, because I can see conflict about what is an assured tenancy and what is a short assured tenancy. It is important to put things in writing. The Minister gave an undertaking to consider the points that were made. Is the response that he has just given us the result of his consideration, or is he still considering the matter?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I stand by the commitments that I gave. I was making the point that the hon. Member was relying on the English provision when he was talking about rights, certainly in relation to housing associations. The equivalent right does not exist under Scottish law; the position in Scotland is different. There is a right under the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act to a written lease. These amendments are designed to open up the tenants' choice provisions in the Bill to allow transfers to public sector landlords.<br><br>
I shall deal first with the general principle and then consider the amendments in detail. The major purpose of the tenants' choice legislation that we propose is to widen the tenure choice of tenants of local authorities and other public sector landlords. In some areas, local authority housing is over 80 per cent. of the total housing stock. In many other areas, it is over 60 per cent—for example, in Motherwell and Coatbridge. We want to diversify tenure, not increase existing near-monopoly. In our view, tenants' choice, which can be exercised only with the agreement of the individual, should be a vehicle for reducing these near-monopolies.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0634">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1011</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Adam Ingram <span class='memberconstituency'>(East Kilbride)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I clearly understand what the Government want. Is that consistent with what the tenants in those areas want? If so, what evidence has he to back up that claim?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think when the opportunities are put before tenants, they will not exercise the right to transfer unless they sincerely believe that they are being given a better opportunity than at present.<br><br>
I want to emphasise two points. First, no local authority tenant who wishes to remain as a tenant of his local authority will be forced to transfer under these provisions. Tenants' choice will be precisely that. It will be for tenants to choose whether to exercise tenants' choice. If their local authority provides a high level of service—and many do—tenants will be satisfied and will be unlikely to exercise their right. Where the local authority provides a less than satisfactory service, tenants should have the option of moving.<br><br>
Secondly, by ruling out in this part of the Bill tenants having the choice of moving from one public sector landlord to another, except for moves to Scottish Homes, we are not ruling out for all time and in all circumstances tenants transferring by some other means from one public sector landlord to another. There are powers in section 12(7) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 for the Secretary of State to approve sales by a local authority of any of its stock. There is nothing to prevent sales to other public sector bodies taking place under that provision, with the Secretary of State's agreement. I take a pragmatic view of that.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I read section 12(7), there is nothing that would give the tenant who is transferred to a private landlord and realises that he has made a ghastly mistake the right to return to the public landlord. There is no way he or she can approach the Secretary of State for Scotland and ask him to exercise his powers under section 12(7). The amendments seek to extend, not restrict, the rights of tenants and to allow that freedom of movement. If freedom of movement were allowed, the landlord would be compensated for the return, because the provisions could be extended to the landlord to make sure that there was no loss to him, while the tenant's right to transfer was preserved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: let us be quite clear. It is not the thrust or purpose of the Bill to extend the public sector provision. I understand that only a short time ago public sector housing in Scotland was the largest in western Europe. A higher proportion of housing is in the public sector in Scotland than in many countries of eastern Europe. We believe that these provisions extend opportunity. Clause 51 is a safeguard for exceptional circumstances which need to be judged on their merits.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 291, 534, 292, 490 and 496 would all in different ways remove the bar on public
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1012</span>
sector landlords being receiving landlords under tenants' choice. Amendments Nos. 514 and 524 are consequential. Amendment No. 291 as drafted would seem to place Scottish Homes in the unusual and, I imagine unintended, position of having to approve itself as a receiving landlord.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would not ask anyone to give approval to himself. Amendment No. 534 is probably designed to correct this point. Taken together, however, these amendments would in practice enable one public sector landlord to require another to transfer property to it, if the tenant agreed, even though there could be little sense in such a transfer. I have in mind a district council taking over property in another district council's area. If a constituent in Hillhead suddenly became the tenant of Edinburgh district council, there would not be much pressure for such transfers. Clearly it would be difficult from an administrative point of view, and make for a bureaucratic nightmare. I might be inclined to endorse the competitive spirit which the amendments could engender, were it not for the great difficulties that many authorities face at present in providing a reasonable service to their tenants. These amendments would permit pepper-pot transfers of housing between housing authorities and would tend to heighten rather than reduce management difficulties faced by authorities.<br><br>
I imagine, from the speeches that hon. Gentlemen have made, that they wish to press some of the amendments to a vote. If they do, I shall invite the Committee to reject them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What a fearsome threat. The Minister has pled guilty to the fact that clause 51 has nothing to do with promoting tenants' choice, but everything to do with political prejudice on the part of the minority Conservative administration in the Scottish Office, which wants to force tenants out of the public sector into the private sector just for the hell of it, regardless of choice.<br><br>
Labour Members are prepared to accept the principle of choice—let there be choice in every direction. If that is what the Minister wants, let us have it by the bucketful and make it possible not only for tenants who are so minded, for whatever reason, to move from the public sector into the private sector. The Minister referred to my constituency, where a number of alternatives are available. The SSHA is still there for the time being, until the Government wind it up or whatever they propose to do with it; there is East Lothian district council and an East Lothian housing association is being set up. There are a number of special housing associations dealing with special needs. There are private landlords, owner-occupation and a whole range of tenure. I am keen on promoting choice, but the Government are putting before the Committee a bogus prospectus. They say that they want choice, but it will be limited to people on one side of the fence. They cannot move in the opposite direction under any circumstances.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0635">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1013</span>
The Minister says that there is an obscure provision in the 1987 Act, which states that with the Secretary of State's approval it will be possible for a local authority or public sector landlord to acquire private property. Who is kidding whom? Will the Government consent to spending public sector capital to acquire private sector property?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is public sector property, from one public sector landlord to another.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I see. I was giving the Minister credit for something that he did not even say. I had the impression that it would be possible under certain circumstances for a Secretary of State—not under this Administration—to give consent to a local authority to acquire other property. Apparently it can be only other public sector property. Then it is the Secretary of State for Scotland in all his glory, sitting in state in Dover House in Whitehall, who will have to set the seal on such transactions. We are supposed to be talking about tenants' choice on the streets and in the villages of Scotland, not even more central interference, which seems to be the hallmark of the Government's practice in Scotland. The measure has everything to do with prejudice and nothing to do with promoting tenants' choice. It is a pure gimmick and will not deal with the underlying problems of housing in Scotland.<br><br>
There is an overwhelming case for extending the choice that the Government say they want to promote, so that tenants can move in either direction. The government are admitting the weakness of their position. They fear the likelihood that tenants will want to move into the public sector. Therefore, they are creating this legislative block to prevent them exercising that choice. The amendments seek to ensure that that choice should extend all the way round, in both directions, from the private sector to the public and from the public to the private.<br><br>
The Minister said that where a local authority is providing a less than adequate service, tenants should have the option to move to a private sector landlord. Surely, the converse of that principle is equally true. The Government are talking about principles, so if a tenant is not satisfied with the service that he is receiving from a private sector landlord, he should have exactly the same right to set in motion the procedure whereby a public sector landlord could take over the ownership of the property. What is wrong with that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</span></span> <i>rose</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Here we have the Secretary of State for Scotland in waiting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not have to wait as long as the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) will. Perhaps he will enlighten the Committee about his proposition. How can the Government instruct the private sector landlord to give up his ownership of the property and his right as landlord? The hon. Gentleman falls into this category himself. He may wish to contemplate how the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1014</span>
Government could instruct him if his tenants decided they did not want him any longer as the landlord, and how he would be recompensed. He might wish to tell the Committee how this would be arrived at.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government have embarked on this process, and they want to create this choice for tenants. The old principle that what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander should apply. The Government want to impose these restrictions on the public sector. It is totally dishonest, and the Committee should support the amendments so as to broaden the scope of the provision for tenants' choice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman fails to understand that what is in the ownership of the public purse can be determined by the Government, because it is owned by the public purse. Determining what is owned by private individuals would involve a fairly complex system whereby some agreement on valuation could be reached. That does not apply when ownership is in the public sector.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Unlike the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) I am more interested in people than in purses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no wish to interpose myself between these two poles of the argument, but I wish to ask the Minister two questions about section 12(7) of the 1987 Act. I apologise for risking being pedantic and legalistic about this.<br><br>
I have had a chance to study section 12(7) more closely, and it appears to me that the provision would allow a local authority to sell or lease any house with the permission of the Secretary of State. Where in section 12(7) does it mention public authority to public authority? I can see that there is power to dispose of a lease from a public authority in a direction, but section 12(7) makes no stipulated reference exclusively to the direction in which the lease goes. Section 12(7) talks about the Secretary of State's powers to make specific directions in relation to an individual transaction, or general directions. I assume, if my interpretation of section 12(7) is correct, that the restriction of the disoposal in the direction of the lease will come in the Secretary of State's directions. It is certainly not in the primary leglisation in the 1987 Act as I read it, though I may be wrong in that.<br><br>
Secondly, if we are using the provisions of section 12(7)—and I should be interested to hear of even one concrete example of the conditions and circumstances in which the Secretary of State would be even tempted to consider using the provisions of the section—what happens to the tenants involved in that process? There is not even one reference to them. Section 12(7), read in the context of the rest of the 1987 Act, was never designed for that process. I think that the Minister is using this as a weak defence against the Opposition's charges that the element of choice to tenants is being restricted.<br><br>
Section 12(7) was not, by any stretch of the imagination, designed to allow public authority transfers <i>inter se</i> in terms of transfers of tenancies.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0636">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1015</span>
The first sentence of Section 12(7) talks about a planning Act. The Minister seems to be clutching at a fairly flimsy straw in that. I am sorry to press him but I think he should clafify the point to the Committee.<br><br>
The Minister's defence of the Government's position, that they are not prepared to admit transfers back to the public sector, was extremely thin. He seemed to rest on the fact that 80 per cent. of tenants in Motherwell are in the public sector. Big deal. That proves nothing one way or the other. I agree that in an ideal world there would be more plurality of provision; we can move in that direction, as I am sure we shall. To base a case on the fact that there is too much about already is simplistic, unacceptable and inadequate. The Minister says that tenants will not be forced into decisions by landlords who approach them with inducements of foreign travel and, that they have enough common sense to realise when they are being sold a pup. So they have if they are being persuaded to go into the public sector and increase the 80 per cent. to 81 per cent. in Motherwell, or wherever. The Minister avoided argument, and the Government cannot do that. If they are genuinely interested in increasing tenants' choice, let them have the courage of their convictions. Let them put forward a stronger case, if they feel they must, against the proposal to allow tenants to go into the public sector if they so choose. Otherwise, it leads people to the inevitable conclusion that there is an ideological opposition to the public sector, and I think that is also a wrong position for the Government to take. I should like to hear a more robust defence of the need to preclude and proscribe a route back to the public sector in the context of the Bill.</span></p>
<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First of all, section 12(7) of the 1987 Act does not in any way exclude such transfer between local authorities. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) has the Act in front of him and it is clear that that is so. It does not exclude "with the consent of the Secretary of State". Clearly it has to have his approval. The hon. Member wished me to give examples of where section 12(7) had been used.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does section 12(7) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 allow for transfer between public sector landlords, and not just between local authority landlords?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that transfers between sector landlords are not procluded by the terms of that section, provided the transfer has the approval of the Secretary of State for Scotland.<br><br>
I can give relevant examples, which relate to Glasgow district council and disposal to co-operatives involving the SSHA. Inevitably, the Secretary of State would be bound to take into account, and to have regard to, the tenants' wishes in considering approval. Section 12(7) of the 1987 Act is being used to approve transfers of several
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1016</span>
hundred houses in Castlemilk from Glasgow district council to the SSHA. A special allocation has been made to the SSHA to allow that acquisition. That is an example of the kind that the hon. Member wanted.<br><br>
The purpose of the Bill is to extend opportunity, and we believe that there is a considerable demand along those lines. If a tenant were allowed to transfer from one local authority to another, while remaining in his house, that would make for what I would describe as pepper-potting, and it would be difficult to organise administratively.<br><br>
There is another reason that we have not touched upon. If the stock in a certain area is 60 to 80 per cent. local authority housing, and that stock is marginally reduced, that means that the resources available to that local authority can be spent on the management and maintenance of the remainder of the stock, which would be to the benefit of the tenants.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has just acknowledged implicitly that what he wants to happen already can happen, and is happening in Glasgow. Where it is seen to be appropriate by both the tenants and the other people involved, be they the local authority, the co-operative, the housing association, the private landlord or the prospective owner-occupier, transfers can and do take place at present. The Government are trying to force the pace.<br><br>
They say that they want choice, but they want only one sort of choice to be exercised. Theirs is a dishonest and flawed prospectus. They have been found out, and not only by the Opposition. The Scottish Consumer Council drafted amendment No. 534 because it thinks that tenants in the private sector who are dissatisfied with the conduct of their landlord as the Minister has said happen in the public sector should have a way out. The Bill as drafted is blocking that. The Government say that they are in favour of tenants' choice. They are in favour of no such thing. They are in favour only of mechanisms to drive people out of the public sector, whether it makes sense of not. The clause is bogus, wrong and dishonest, and it can contribute absolutely nothing to solving the problems of housing in Scotland. I ask the Committee to support the amendment.</span></p>

With this, it will be convenient to take amendment No 533, in page 34, line 34, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(2A) a tenant may, within six months of any agreement made under this Part of this Act, revoke that agreement by written notice without any loss of penalty; the notice to take effect 28 days after the date on which the notice was sent."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot speak for amendment No. 533 which stands in the name of the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood), and I cannot quite figure out what it would do. Amendment No. 491 will simply lead to a re-run of the debate that we have just had. It would establish a right to acquire from private sector landlords. The Minister and the Committee know that we do not see why the private sector should be protected from this process in the way that the Government intend. We have already had that argument on the previous group of amendments. We won the argument, but, as usual, we lost the vote. I do not see that much is to be gained by going over the same territory. Accordingly I shall not move amendment No. 491.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 80 to 83 seek to extend part III by including the right for a district council to purchase development corporation houses at or about the time of dissolution. I shall try to relate what I have to say about the time of dissolution. I shall try to relate what I have to say to what the Minister said about section 12(7) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987. Perhaps the Minister will give greater clarification during this debate.<br><br>
Amendment No. 81 is the key amendment, and it attempts to add a new subsection (10) to clause 51. The amendments have to be taken in conjunction with the new clause 1, with which I shall deal later, and which seeks to lay down proper ground rules for the transfer of new town housing stock to the appropriate district councils.<br><br>
The arrangements between district councils and development corporations for managing housing stock within each of the new towns vary, but the most developed arrangement—and one that has been commented upon by Government Ministers and others—is the one in my constituency of East Kilbride. That is by virtue of the fact that East Kilbride is the longest-existing new town and development of the management of housing stock has taken place over a number of years.<br><br>
The district council and the development corporation have a very close working relationship, which has been built on over the years and is jealously guarded by the local representatives, and by the board and management of the development corporation. That close working relationship, by my reading of the Bill, will now be put in jeopardy and will eventually be brought to an end if the Bill becomes law. That is why I have tabled amendments Nos. 80 to 83, which try to preserve the integrity of the housing stock in the new towns.<br><br>
The amendments are based on a number of factors. If the new town of East Kilbride is looked at in isolation, as opposed to the whole of East Kilbride district, council, the local housing demand for rented accommodation has to be satisfied from development corporation stock. That is because within the new town area there are very few local authority houses. The bulk of the district council's housing stock lies in the landward area. If the waiting list were to be related to the corporation's housing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0638">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1019</span>
stock only, the waiting list would be seven tims the district council's housing stock. That would take us back to the bad old days when young couples and families in cities had to wait decades for a house. That situation used to occur until Labour authorities started a massive house-building programme in Scotland to take account of the problems. No one wants to see a return to that.<br><br>
As a further justification for the amendment, I refer to the report produced by the National Audit Office which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"One Corporation has a common rental structure and a joint letting policy with its local authority"—</p></blockquote>
that is East Kilbride—
<br><blockquote><p>"another has recently agreed joint house letting regulations".</p></blockquote>
The Government have been encouraging the district councils and the new town development corporations to move towards such joint letting regulations. When that happens, the functions pertaining to both authorities are then carried out in the main by the development corporation. That occurs in East Kilbride, it results in an extremely efficient use of resources to the benefit of the taxpayers, the ratepayers and the rentpayers within the housing stock. It means that waiting lists and house allocations are managed by the development corporation.<br><br>
In East Kilbride and, I am sure, in other new towns where such joint house letting regulations have been agreed to, the tenants begin to understand clearly who they must approach in order to get a house. In East Kilbride the system has been well understood for over 20 years. People who lived in a district council and before that in a borough realised that the development corporation was the main house-letting agency, and that it looked after district council houses as well, and they understood how to set about applying for houses and so on.<br><br>
12.30 p.m.<br><br>
As I understand the Bill, efficient and desirable house management arrangements would have to be unscrambled and alternative arrangements negotiated with Scottish Homes or any other approved landlord whom the Government impose upon new town tenants. That will result in a poorer and more remote service if the landlord is not in the new town area but lives in Glasgow, Edinburgh or somewhere else and clearly in a more expensive service for ratepayers, taxpayers and rent payers in the new towns.<br><br>
The amendments seek a way to retain the desirable features of the joint house-letting management by allowing district councils to purchase the development corporation stock at dissolution. It has always been clearly understood that when a development corporation is wound up, its houses will transfer to the district councils.<br><br>
In dealing with new clause 1, I shall first give the background to the position that has applied for a number of years. On 23 July 1982, the Secretary of State announced his intention to wind up new towns and made it clear that, once the progress had begun,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1020</span>
rented housing owned by the development corporations would be transferred to the relevant district councils as soon as a transfer scheme was prepared. Following that announcement, a working party was set up early in 1983 to consider the transfer. It consisted of representatives of the Industry Department for Scotland, which was responsible for the new towns, and the relevant district councils. I regret that the Minister who was responsible for that idea is not here today to respond to some of the points that I shall make.<br><br>
A great deal of detailed work went into the working party's considerations. It reported to the Secretary of State in August 1984 and recommended that the transfer of housing should take place on a no-profit, no-loss basis, thus protecting the financial interests of the district councils. Yet, following that detailed work, a ministerial statement was issued in November 1984 which confirmed yet again the Government's intention to transfer new town housing stock to districts in advance of the wind-up.<br><br>
Therefore, the Government made commitments about what was to happen to the housing stock in new towns and a considerable amount of taxpayers', ratepayers' and rentpayers' money was spent on laying down proper ground rules and a framework for carrying them out. All that work has been destroyed by the Bill and by paragraph 6.13 of the White Paper.<br><br>
Since the publication of the White Paper and the Bill, and not because of scaremongering by local representatives or Members of Parliament, constituents who are tenants of a development corporation have come to me and asked me what to do. They say that they may be able to afford to buy their house, but they are uncertain about the future, not only about the job future of the main breadwinner in the family but because they do not want to be transferred to a private sector landlord. That is documented in my constituency records and I do not know how to advise my constituents. I cannot tell them to buy their house, because I do not want to give them financial advice. I cannot tell them who their future landlord will be. I can tell them that there us a great deal of uncertainty.<br><br>
I refer my constituents to the Second Reading of the Bill on 11 January, when the Secretary of State said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The White Paper made it clear that, consistent with the general attention to give people a wider choice of housing, we would seek powers to enable new town development corporations to dispose of their housing assets to a wide range of alternative landlords."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 11 January 1988; Volume 125, c.53.]</p></blockquote>
There is no choice in that. When one talks about disposal, one is not talking about choice for tenants in development corporation houses. I do not believe that the Government will consult new town development corporation tenants or ask them whether they wish simply to transfer to a different landlord, because everything that has been said on the Bill, in the House and elsewhere, clearly sets out the Government's position that they will not allow that transfer to take place. The tenants of the new town development corporations will be faced with straightforward compulsion according to what the Secretary of State said on 11 January.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0639">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1021</span>
I want to ask the Minister a number of questions. As that will clearly require new legislation, when will it be brought forward? What choice will the tenant have within that legislation? Will the new town development corporation tenant have the right to choose the district council as an alternative landlord? I seek the answers to those questions, but new town development corporation tenants seek the answers too. If the Minister gives the right answers, I shall be able to advise my consituents, as I am sure my hon. Friends who represent the other Scottish new towns will be able to do.<br><br>
New town development corporation tenants became tenants secure in the knowledge that at some stage their houses would be transferred to the appropriate local authority. I have given the Committee the background and the Minister's clear commitments. People in the new towns are now saying that they have been misled by a dishonest government. Everything that was said in 1982 and 1984 will now not apply if the Bill becomes law as it stands.<br><br>
Therefore, I ask the Committee to support amendments Nos. 80 to 83 and new clause 1. If they do, they will put to rest the fears of the 45,000 families who live in development corporations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart <span class='memberconstituency'>(Eastwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall comment briefly on the wind-up of the new towns. Before I do so, I seek your indulgence, Mr. Martin, to make a more general point instead of making it on a point of order. I am a little surprised to see that the proceedings of the Committee on Tuesday afternoon are not reported on the Order Paper after Standing Committee J this morning. There may be a simple explanation, but I think that it has happened fairly consistently.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Minister will no doubt wish to respond to the points made by the hon. member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram) but will not accept either them or new clause 1. Even the hon. Gentleman will recognise that they are premature, because we have not yet reach the wind-up of the new towns. The present legislative position, as he rightly told the Committee, is that the district councils will officially inherit new town housing unless the 1968 Act is changed. If there is to be such a change, there is bound to be a legislative opportunity for hon. Members to discuss it.<br><br>
It is sensible for the Government to review all the policy options in relation to the disposal of the new towns' residual housing stock at this stage. It is right at least to question the assumption of the 1968 Act that local authorities should automatically inherit that residual stock, given, for example, the excellent sales record of new town development corporations and the considerable scope for expanding community-based housing initiatives in the new towns. Therefore, I hope that it will be possible to continue to develop the diversity of housing tenure that has been one of the most attractive features of housing policy in the new towns.<br><br>
I hope, finally, that my hon. Friend the Minister will take this opportunity to make it clear to tenants that there has been some misrepresentation of the proposals in the housing White Paper.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1022</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Who has been making those misrepresentations?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the hon. Member for East Kilbride came close to saying that the White Paper suggested that tenants would be forcibly transferred to private landlords. My understanding is that that is simply not the case. That is not the Government's intention, nor is it what the White Paper said. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will make it clear that that is not the Government's intention in relation to the winding up of the five Scottish new towns.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been an important debate. When the Committee was first selected I knew that the hon. member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram) would make a strong speech on this subject. He is right to say that the White Paper shifted the emphasis to some extent when it said:
<br><blockquote><p>"the authomatic transfer of the entire housing stock to a local authority can no longer be regarded as consistent with the Government's aim of increasing diversity and choice. The Government therefore intend to review the arrangements that will apply to New Town housing on the wind-up of the Development Corporations. Proposals to amend existing legislation to enable New Town Development Corporations to dispose of their housing assets in advance of wind-up to a wide range of alternative landlords will shortly be brought forward."</p></blockquote>
The key is that, as mentioned in that paragraph, there will be a review. In response to my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), that review will cover all policy options. We are certainly not ruling out the possibility of transfer of some new town housing to local authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister ruling out the compulsory transfer of new town development corporation tenants to any type of private sector tenancy?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot envisage the exact terms of a future new towns Bill, but in the context of this bill there will be no question of compulsion in advance of wind-up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There will be another Bill for that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I said, the Government are carrying out a review. Once conclusions are reached, we can frame legislation. We hope that it will be possible to introduce it in 1989–90 but that will depend on other pressures on the legislative programme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We must press the Minister on this. There is supposed to be collective responsibility, even in the Scottish Office element of the Government. I presume that the Minister is responsible for the White Paper which makes this reference to a shift in Government policy on the future destination of new town development corporation housing.<br><br>
The Minister of State who is responsible for the new towns is also a member of the Committee, even
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0640">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1023</span>
though he is a rare visitor to it. Surely it is not too much to expect the Government to give a definitive reply to my hon. Friend the Member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram). As the Minister has acknowledged, the amendments and the new clause have been on the paper for many weeks now, so it is not too much to hope for a proper reply in the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I very much regret giving way to the hon. Gentleman, because he has not yet heard my reply. I have hardly begun what I have to say.<br><br>
The hon. Member for East Kilbride referred to uncertainty. I cannot anticipate the outcome of the review, but certainly tenants' wishes will weigh heavily. As regards consulting with the new towns, no tenants will be forced to transfer in advance of wind-up.<br><br>
I was asked whether the proposed new power for new town development corporations would allow them to sell houses ignoring tenants' wishes. The answer is no. The new towns will take fully into account the views and wishes of the tenants. A debate on a Government amendment is still to come.<br><br>
12.45 pm.<br><br>
The hon. Member for East Kilbride implied that the Government had reneged on their 1984 commitment. As I said, we made it clear in the White Paper that, given the interest of new town tenants in home ownership and their potential interest in other forms of tenure, it would be inappropriate to continue to expect corporations to transfer all their remaining housing stock to district councils on wind-up, but we have not ruled out a role for local authorities. We shall review all the options in consultation with the local authorities concerned, before bringing forward fresh proposals for amendments to the New Towns (Scotland) Act 1968. Therefore, the theme that the hon. Member for East Kilbride has taken and his amendments are premature, because they relate to considerations of policy on the wind-up of new towns which are not the subject of the Bill.<br><br>
The amendments seek to confer powers on district councils to acquire development corporation rented housing, once the Secretary of State has made an order for the winding up of a new town lying within the area of the district council concerned. These amendments are therefore designed to meet a situation which will not arise until some way into the future. Moreover, they seem to ignore completely the fact that under section 36 of the New Towns (Scotland) Act 1968, as it now stands, the district council is in effect the only possible inheritor of a new town housing undertaking when the development corporation is wound up. It will take another Act of Parliament to change that situation.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman seems to be more concerned with what might happen in a few years' time, instead of focusing on the present realities of new town housing. The Government will shortly table a largely technical amendment, designed to remove the constraints on the disposal of land imposed by the 1968 Act. Section 18 of that Act empowers development corporations to dispose of land for the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1024</span>
purpose of the development or laying out of the new town. Our amendment is designed to recognise the growing maturity of the towns in the 20 years since the 1968 Act was passed. It will enable development corporations to dispose of new town housing land in a manner wholly consistent with the Government's wider housing policy objectives, particularly the widening of home ownership. Our amendment is a modest, sensible reform which will yield positive benefits for those living in the new towns.<br><br>
The Government's view on the wind-up of the Scottish new towns, as my hon. Friend the Minister of State recently made clear to the hon. Gentlemen, is that no new town will begin the process of wind-up before 1990. We remain firmly committed to reviewing before then the progress achieved by the new towns, which has been substantial in the hon. General's consituency. In our White Paper on Scottish housing we made clear our general view that, in the light of the evident progress made in diversifying tenures in the new towns over the past nine years, it would no longer be appropriate to assume that local authorities would be the primary or sole inheritors of new town housing at wind-up. The options for housing transfer will therefore be the subject of a detailed and wide-ranging review, and neither I nor my hon. Friend the Minister of State can anticipate its findings. We should prefer to consider all the relevant facts and arguments before determining a policy. The hon. Gentleman is displaying a blind faith in district councils which ignores possible alternatives.<br><br>
I want to say a word about the high quality of housing provision in new towns and pay tribute to the efforts of both public and private sector bodies involved in producing such an excellent environment for residents and investors. The quality of housing has a key feature in the prosperity of the new towns and their social success. We are determined to ensure that that quality, so much appreciated by tenants and owners alike, is sustained for the benefit of future generations.<br><br>
I wish to make it clear to new town tenants that they have nothing to fear from the Government's housing proposals. I say that because of the weak efforts of the Opposition to paint a rather different picture, both in the Committee and in the new towns and their local newspapers. It is the present Government who have given new town tenants the opportunity to buy their homes, and over 21,000 families have already done so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is this a press release?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is the present Government who have expanded private house building in the new towns so that a further 11,000 families now live in houses built by the private sector. If present rates of sale continue, the number of houses left under development corporation management by the end of this Parliament will be down to 36,000. That figure does not take account of new community-based housing initiatives that I hope to see established in the new towns.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0641">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1025</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How many of the new houses built in the private sector in any or all of the new towns are actually purchased by young married couples on the waiting lists? If the Minister does not know the answer, will he find out?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will do my best to get an answer, but I suspect that the answer will require—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer is next to none.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that he thinks that the answer is none?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Next to none.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will certainly make inquiries, but I shall need a little notice before giving a definitive reply.<br><br>
In our review of policy we shall take account of the variation in circumstances in the five towns and the desire of new town tenants to have a degree of choice over their future landlords when, as must eventually happen, the option of remaining with the development corporation ceases to exist.<br><br>
I am, of course, aware that the hon. Member for East Kilbride speaks with the benefit of advice from Scottish Local Authorities with New Towns. I want to assure both the local authorities and the hon. Gentleman that the Government in due course intend to consult SLANT fully on those aspects of wind-up policy, including housing, which will be of direct relevance to the local authorities concerned. It is in everyone's interest to effect a smooth transition on wind-up and we shall approach those consultations in a spirit of genuine co-operation. I repeat, however, that no new town will begin to be wound up before 1 April 1990. In the light of our consultations with SLANT and others, we shall formulate our proposals on the transfer of new town housing at wind-up and bring these forward for debate in legislation.<br><br>
If I may return for a moment to the Bill before the Committee, new town tenants are, of course, to be given, in common with local authority tenants, the right to transfer to another landlord. That could include transfers to help create tenant co-operatives or housing associations, which I am sure most, if not all, hon. Members would wish to encourage. New town tenants will continue to enjoy secure tenancies after the Bill is enacted. The Bill safeguards existing rights and opens up new choices for development corporation tenants, and I deplore any efforts to sow the seeds of doubt and confusion in the minds of tenants by a systematic campaign of disinformation.<br><br>
It is important that we do not pre-empt the review of housing transfer at wind-up promised by the White Paper. It is not appropriate for the amendments to go through in their present form. At the appropriate moment the Government will bring forward legislation. The hon. Gentleman will then have the opportunity to propose amendments, perhaps along similar lines to those that we are considering today.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1026</span>
At present, however, those proposals are a long way premature. In the light of what I have said, I hope and expect that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment. If not, I must ask the Committee to reject it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I asked from a sedentary position whether I was being accused of disinformation. I hope that I am not being so accused because I specifically asked questions so that I could assist my constituents. As I explained, they were coming to me, and I know that my hon. Friends in other new towns are having the same questions asked. But I am no further forward. I am told that legislation will be brought forward, possibly in 1989, but that it will depend upon the Government's legislative programme. Therefore, the only advice I can give to my constituents who are development corporation tenants must relate to what Ministers have said. I always defer to the view of the Minister's master, the Secretary of State, and I refer again to what he said on 11 January 1988:
<br><blockquote><p>"The White Paper made it clear that, consistent with the general intention to give people a wider choice of housing, we would seek powers to enable new town development corporations to dispose of their housing assets to a wide range of alternative landlords."</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>[<i>Official Report,</i> 11 January 1988; Vol. 125, c.53.]</p></blockquote>
I do not think that the Minister today has written out the possibility of that disposal and now that that is clearly the case and that the disposal of the assets will go only to other public sector landlords, I shall be in a better position to advise my constituents.<br><br>
The Minister also said that the Government would take into account the wishes of the tenants when it came to determining how the stock in the new towns was to be disposed of. How does he intend to do that? Will he conduct a ballot of the new town tenants?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Fat chance!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will he ask the district council, which comprises democratically elected representatives, and take their view as it stands and act accordingly?<br><br>
The Minister has also said that it is premature for my hon. Friends and me to raise this issue. I refer him again to the National Audit Office report of 22 January 1988, which said:
<br><blockquote><p>"In the NAO's view the scale and complexity of potential difficulties mean that it is not too soon to start implementing the many changes recommended by the working party. Substantial time will be neded to resolve problems which might arise on the transfer of housing and other assets, particularly of a social or community nature, to establish common rental and associated housing management policies; and to tackle the question of responsibility for outstanding loans and the associated interest charges."</p></blockquote>
If the Minister accuses me of being premature, he appears also to be saying the same of the National Audit Office. My case rests on the advice that I received from SLANT, which is truly representative of the people in the new towns. It also rests upon the document produced by the National Audit Office. The Minister must explain a little further why the NAO's view is premature. He can accuse me as much as he likes, but I shall be interested to hear his views on the NAO's position.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1027</span>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises a number of points. He asked whether there could be any disposal to the private sector in advance of wind-up. The answer is that under the provisions of the Bill it would depend on the wishes of the tenants, who would be secure tenants. As regards the review, I cannot say at this stage whether there would be a ballot of the tenants. That is an option that will be considered during the review. There will certainly be wide consultation with the local authorities and others on the policy concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not interested in bland statements about wide consultation. What exactly does "wide consultation" mean? Who will be consulted? To what level will those people be consulted? And if their views are at variance with the wishes of the Government, will their views be taken rather than those of the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has been a shop steward in the past, so he will know if consultation have not taken place. I think that his judgement would be as good as mine on that point. Obviously, consultations will have to be full and genuine. I recognise the seriousness with which the hon. Gentleman is putting forward the interests of his constituents. The NAO report on Scottish new towns also acknowledge that the policy on transfer of residual housing assets is to be reviewed and that transfer to local authorities might not be the sole or prime option.<br><br>
I have very little to add. When I mentioned disinformation.</span></p>
