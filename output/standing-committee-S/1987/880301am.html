	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Adam Ingram 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Kilbride)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. On Thursday we debated at length matters relating to the new towns. The Minister gave certain assurances and statements about his intentions for the future. Where he could not give assurances, he left things deliberately vague. At 1 am on Saturday I received a letter from the Minister delivered by ministerial car, setting out an amendment only obliquely referred to in the Committee. Its import has yet to be debated, and I do not intend to comment on Government new clause 10—what concerns me is the contempt shown by the Government to the Committee and to the House by not tabling the amendment in time. Is it in order for the Government to operate in such a manner? I bow to your greater knowledge of these matters, Mr. Martin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a matter for the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gave notice on Thursday that the amendment would be introduced, and I endeavoured to get the information to the hon. Member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram) as quickly as possible. On Friday, however, I had to give news to the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) that authorisation for a co-operative, estimated to be of the value of £6.5 million over the next three years, had been given. That took up most of the day, but as soon as I arrived in Edinburgh I gave top priority to this matter and would have telephoned the hon. Member for East Kilbride had I not had to address a large meeting of tenants in my constituency on housing. I got the message to the hon. Gentleman as quickly as possible, and I gave as much notice as I could. I expect that the hon. Gentleman will speak fully on the issue when it comes up in our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin, I take into account your previous ruling, which I noted did not apply to the Minister. I appreciate the difficulties that Ministers are in, but we were sitting here in the Committee on Thursday and the Minister clearly knew what was in the Government's mind. He could have saved a
	<span class='label label-info column'>1072</span>
considerable sum of public money by passing the draft amendment to me across the Committee. That would have assisted both him and me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am being faulted for allowing the Minister to give an explanation. These are not matters for the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that it is different from those that have been raised so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a difficulty here. The Minister of State, Scottish Office, who is a member of the Committee and is supposed to be responsible for new towns in Scotland—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Charman has ruled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) seems to think that he is chairing the Committee, but so far as I know you are still the Chairman, Mr. Martin. On 25 February the Minister of State, the hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Lang), issued a press release which began as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Commenting on today's consideration of the Housing (Scotland) Bill in a House of Commons Committee, Mr. Ian Lang MP, Minister of State at the Scottish Office with responsibility for New Towns, said …" </p></blockquote>
Why can he not come to the Committee to give us the benefit of his thoughts rather than issuing a press release?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman knows that that is not a matter for the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is very strange.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be strange, but it is not a matter for me. Hon. Members have been good so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I believe that it is a pertinent point of order. Is the Minister not duty bound to give priority to informing members of the Committee and hon. Members about developments? The engagements in his diary may be important, but they should not take precedence over providing information to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are not matters for me. The Minister has to obey the same rules as everyone else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister of State is not here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Provided that the Minister gives due notice as laid down by the House, he is perfectly in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Doran 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 537, in page 32, line 21, after "landlord", insert
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0669">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1073</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>", Scottish Homes, and any other person or body expressing an interest in the application,".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take amendment No. 551, in page 32, line 32, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"and on Scottish Homes (where the applicant is not Scottish Homes).".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 537 would require the approved person in terms of clause 53(1) also to serve a notice on Scottish Homes that he intends to assume control over particular properties. The reason for the amendment is to enable Scottish Homes to monitor the applications made by prospective landlords to enable it to fulfil more effectively the general functions set out in clauses 1 and 2 of the Bill. I refer specifically to its responsibility to give advice and assist in the provision of a variety of other services under clause 2(2)(e) and also the duty that it has under clause 2(2)(q) to
	<br><blockquote><p>"promote, or assist in the promotion of, publicity relating to its general functions."</p></blockquote>
By monitoring and keeping track of applications—no control is suggested—it will be better able to monitor what is happening to houses and how the Act is being implemented and better able to fulfil its responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 551 is consistent with amendment No. 537 and its effect is similar. It would ensure that the approved landlord must serve on Scottish Homes a copy of his application to acquire the house. Again it would allow for monitoring and more effective assessment of what is happening to housing in Scotland. At present there is no such requirement on a landlord. One must remember that the Bill would allow tenants to choose a landlord and houses to be taken out of the public stock. It is important to have a monitoring service to check where the houses are and to allow Scottish Homes better to fulfil its other responsibilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the points that the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) had made. Amendment No. 537 is defective in that it would require Scottish Homes, when it is the applicant, to serve the application to purchase on itself, but I am content to recommend to the Committee that amdendment No. 551 be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like the Minister's assurance that the effect of accepting amendment No. 551 would be as we have suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 515, in page 32, line 26, at end insert and
	<br><blockquote><p>"(c) containing a statement by the applicant detailing the works which he intends to carry out to the house and the period within
	<span class='label label-info column'>1074</span>
which he shall carry them out, and a declaration that no inducements (including gifts of money or goods or rent free periods) have been offered or made to the qualifying tenant".</p></blockquote>
We are dealing here with circumstances in which a new landlord has to serve notice on the public sector landlord of his intention to aquire the public sector landlord's property—in agreement with the tenant, of course. The amendment has been suggested by Dundee district council. The Minister was in Dundee on Friday, and I should like to take this opportunity to record the satisfaction not only of Dundee district council and the citizens of Dundee, but of the tenants of Ormiston crescent tenants' co-operative at the Ministers announcement that he was authorised the Housing Corporation of Scotland to fund that co-operative to the extent of £6.5 million. It was a very welcome announcement and everyone in Dundee was delighted by it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister himself warned us to beware of Greeks bearing gifts, and we had cause to appreciate that advice more fully in the course of the day, when the chairman of the SSHA took the opportunity of the Ministers visit to Dundee to launch an attack of the opponents of the Bill, whom he accused of misleading tenants in Scottish Homes in particular of the full impact of the Bill. I hope that that was not directed against my good self and other members of the Committee as we have never tried to mislead anyone about the full implications of the Bill for tenants of Scottish Homes or for tenants anywhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right of public sector tenants to choose a private sector landlord is an important issue. It is not as straightforward as the Minister or his Back Benchers would have us believe. It is a right that does not extend to tenants in the private sector, nor does it allow tenants to choose, for example, district councils as their new landlord. It is a restricted right, and it will usually be applied only in circumstances where a tenant of a district council will be allowed to transfer his tenancy to a private sector landlord of his choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is in line with the Government's stated intention, both in the White Paper and in the papers that support the Bill, that district councils should in future have their role reduced as direct providers of housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 53 and associated clauses set out to reduce the role of district councils and to tempt tenants away from district councils and into the private sector, but is not a genuine choice. That is what concerns us. For a long time the Government have starved district councils of their ability to fulfil their responsibilities as landlords. As the Minister well knows, only last week in the announcements about housing support grant and rate fund contributions the Government once again undercut the ability of district councils to meet the requirements of their tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dundee district council used to receive from the Government more than £8 million in housing support grant, which enabled it to maintain and manage district council stock. That sum has been slashed to nothing. For a number of years there has been no housing support grant to Dundee district council. The same is true of the rate fund contribution. Previously the council was allowed to contribute from the rates more than £6 million for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0670">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1075</span>
the upkeep of district council stock. Now it is allowed to contribute less than £500,000. As a consequence, the service that the district council is able to give to its tenants has been greatly reduced. In those circumstances, the tenant is not being given a genuine choice because the district council has been starved of the ability to provide the kind of service that the tenant might expect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister went round Dundee on Friday, he saw houses needing new windows to be installed right now, but the council does not have the money to install them. He saw houses that require central heating because of dampness and condensation problems. He saw a clear example in Whitfield where the district council has been forced to erect canopies to protect tenants of multi-storey blocks from falling masonry because there is no money to maintain the buildings. In those circumstances, people cannot be expected to make a genuine choice between a district council with its hands tied behind its back, unable to provide the service, and a new private sector landlord who might make all kinds of enticements to persuade tenants to transfer the property to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to ensure that the landlord must specify his intentions about the works to be carried out. That is important. Craigiebank in Dundee is a very good area. People have to wait up to 25 years to obtain a house there because of the high demand. The tenants tend to be older people and the council does not have the money to carry out the repairs that it would like to do. A private sector landlord might offer all kinds of enticements, promising to put in new windows, central heating, and so on. Unelss we commit landlords to carry out the works that they promise, there is a danger that landlords will bribe tenants to switch over and then leave them in the lurch by not fulfilling the landlords' part of the bargain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the amendment seeks to prevent inducements being offered to tenants. It was drawn to my attention by Dundee district council and I have drawn it to the attention of the Committee that a private sector landlord in Wales was offering holidays in Marbella to tenants who were prepared to switch their tenancy from the public sector to him. That kind of thing must be opposed. What the private sector landlord wants is ownership of extremely good valuable housing property. Because the Government have tied their hands, district councils they have been unable to maintain such property to the standards that the tenants might wish. As a result, private landlords wishing to get their hands on the property may offer all kinds of inducements and enticements, rent-free periods, holidays, cash, and so on. Once the tenant has exercised the choice under the Bill, he cannot exercise it again—he is trapped with the private sector landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the Minister should concede that private sector landlords who operate under the clause must put in writing exactly what kind of repairs they will carry out to the property. Secondly, the Committee must make sure that landlords are not enabled to offer enticements to tenants to take them away from the public sector into the private sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1076</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his comments on the east Dundee co-operative. I should say briefly that the housing support grant for Scotland for this year is higher than it was in 1987–88.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is still nil in Dundee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have included a 10 per cent. increase in management and maintenance expenditure in the formula that we used. In relation to Dundee's housing revenue account allocation, the provisional allocation for 1987–88 was £13 million. For this year it is £15.2 million. If receipts are high, I expect it to be considerably increased.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that there has been a significant increase in housing support grant. How does he square that with the fact that the majority of Scottish local housing authorities do not receive any housing support grant at all?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is because income exceeds expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So the grant has gone up from nil to nil.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where expenditure exceeds income, there is the formula. I am under a statutory obligation to consult fully with COSLA, so the actual mechanism under which the money is distributed is agreed with COSLA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) mentioned that I used the phrase "Beware of Greeks bearing gifts". I think that that was said on Friday when I was seen giving a cup of coffee to Jimmy Hamilton. When we were both Scots Whips the then Secretary of State for Scotland, Willie Hamilton, issued the same warning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is on the same theme—beware of inducements, and there is a good deal to be said for tenants exercising common sense in this. I do not believe that it is the concern of the public sector landlord to know what works an acquiring landlord proposes to carry out and on what time scale—that is a matter for the tenant and the new landlord. If the tenant is not satisfied with what he is offered by a prospective new landlord, he will not agree to the transfer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note what the amendment says about inducements, but I do not believe that that kind of provision should appear in the Bill. Indeed, why should one wish to rule out rent-free periods entirely? For example, it would not be unreasonable for a new landlord carrying out works on a house to offer the tenant a rent-free period in recompense for the disturbance caused. For that reason, I recommend that the amendment should not be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Any disturbance that might be caused in the circumstances that the Minister has just described would pale into insignificance beside the disturbance which could easily occur not much
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0671">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1077</span>
later should the tenant be rash enough to allow himself to be lured out of a secure tenancy in the public sector into an insecure, so-called assured tenancy in the private sector. Having had a little rent holiday, as the Minister just said, as a sweetener or inducement, the rent is likely to be put up spectacularly within weeks or months. The tenant would then find himself with limited security and the prespect of eviction whenever the private speculator who has acquired the property wants to cash in on his asset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) is right to say that the powers and the framework being set up by the Government in the Bill are likely to be abused. It will be far too easy for fly-by-night landlords to send fast-talking purchasers round the streets to to encourage people to sign on the dotted line. Then things would be set in motion from which it may be difficult for the tenant to extract himself. Subsection (4)(b) makes it possible for a tenant to extricate himself, but it requires a positive action and things could gather momentum of their own accord. Before he knew where he was, a tenant who had enjoyed the advantage of a holiday in Spain or a short rent-free period could find himself going from the frying-pan into the fire. One can imagine the examples that would be referred to Esther Rantzen in "That's Life" of the difficulties that people are likely to find themselves in as a consequence of the Bill. My hon. Friend is right to warn against the blandishments and abuses that will arise from fast-talking tenancy touts trying to take advantage of this scheme. I am less than satisfied by the Minister's explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would expect Scottish Homes, in the material which it makes widely available, to warn tenants who might transfer of the pitfalls, the risks and the dangers as well as of the advantages. Certainly I would expect it to take into account in the approval process any known incidents of unfair inducements and to use that information when considering further approvals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an important point. I am glad to hear the Government's intention that Scottish Homes will monitor the antics of those who will be involved in this. He has implicitly acknowledged that the system may be abused. Regardless of that, however, he is setting in a motion a Bill which will be wide open to such abuse. Nevertheless, I welcome the fact that the Government, through Scottish Homes, intend to monitor the practices involved. What sanctions do they intend to apply? Will they simply withdraw the registration of the acquiring landlord or will there be any punishment or come-back against people who have unfairly abused tenants?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously if a person breaks the law and tries to buy a tenant, that would give rise to a criminal charge if fraudulent circumstances were put forward, but would depend very much on the facts and circumstances of the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1078</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am intrigued by what the Minister has said. He seemed to suggest that giving a bribe as an inducement, which is what the amendment attempts to outlaw, is a criminal offence. I cannot see how that is so, although it would be a criminal offence if a landlord indulged in harassment, and so on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman did not understand what I was saying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the Minister understood it himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was saying that in certain circumstances, if corrupt practices were involved in an attempt to bribe tenants, that might give rise to a criminal charge. It would clearly depend on the facts and circumstances of the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his initial reply to the debate the Minister said that it was all right to offer inducements. As he gave rent-free periods as an example, I take it that rent-free periods would not be a corrupt practice, so what is a corrupt practice? What kind of offer which a landlord might make to a tenant could be described as a corrupt practice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If major alterations are being carried out inside a house and the tenant's movements are extremely restricted and he has to put up with a great deal of noise and inconvenience, a rent-free period might be a possibility. That would be legitimate in all the circumstances. The amendment is too wide and all-embracing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should get to the bottom of this. If I knock on a tenant's door in one of my housing schemes and tell him that I want to take over as his landlord and offer him £1,000 for the privilege, is that corrupt?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would depend on all the facts and circumstances. The hon. Gentleman is a lawyer—[Hon. Members: "So are you."] Yes, I am a lawyer, but I am careful not to give snap legal judgements without considering all the facts and circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to press the point, but the Minister suggested that inducements were criminal. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr McAllion) rightly pointed out, when the Minister made his response to my hon. Friends remarks there was no suggestion that inducements, rent-free periods or anything of that sort were criminal it was only when the point was pressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minster seems to be suggesting that if, with the approval of Scottish Homes safely tucked in my pocket I knock on a tenant's door and offer him or her £ 1,000, a holiday or some other inducement, there are circumstances in which that would be criminal. I do not understand that, because there is nothing in the Bill or in any legislation of which I am aware
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0672">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1079</span>
which would make it criminal, so long as the offer was not followed by threats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned about letting landlords rip on the market to acquire at cut rates very expensive and valuable properties, with the ability at the same time to remove from tenants most of their present protections. It will be worth a landlord's while to buy his way into the market through the tenant. Some people will not be able to resist that, because they are poor, on benefits or for all sorts of other reasons. The Minister said that there were circumstances where inducement would be corrupt and a criminal act. Will he define what he means?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As an advocate I have not heard of one case involving the circumstances that the hon. Gentleman mentions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a new circumstance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The White Paper says that it is without precedent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the tenant who pays the rent. One does not expect the landlord to pay a huge capital sum to a person for becoming a tenant. If the hon. Gentleman can state a single example of that happening in the private rented sector in Scottish legal history, I should be extremely interested, but I think that he is suggesting a hypothetical situation which has no basis in fact.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is showing how little he understands the housing market in Scotland. In my experience as a solicitor who has acted for landlords and tenants there are occasions when landlords are willing to buy out a tenant's interest in various ways, with no immediate return. That is not uncommon. Landlords will encourage their tenants to move or to accept modernisation schemes. They may have a better tenant for the property and the only way to remove the existing tenant is by paying a capital sum. That would be part of the landlord's investment, but Opposition Members are concerned that certain landlords will be let rip on the market and that inducements—bribes, if you like—will be offered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to come back to the Minister's statement that in some circumstances such behaviour will be a criminal act. I want to know why that is so, but have still not had an answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect the hon. Gentleman is trying to confuse the issue. If the landlord is a doctor and there is a doctor's surgery in the house and he wants a part-interest in it and buys the good will, that is a straightforward contract. He is perfectly entitled negotiate and reach an agreement with the tenant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not criminal, then?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course it is not criminal, but I would not describe it as inducement—I would describe it as a straightforward negotiation. The parties can come to a legitimate
	<span class='label label-info column'>1080</span>
agreement. A wide measure of common sense can be used here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Common sense is precisely what is lacking. The Minister is up to his oxters in difficulty, having told my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) that there is a possibility of a criminal offence being committed in connection with such inducements. I am fascinated. Indeed, I was rather encouraged by what the Minister said. I thought that it implied that there would be a sanction against landlords who sought to abuse this part of the Bill. Let us face it—it is by no means unlikely. The Minister says that it is a hypothetical situtation. This is a hypothetical Bill. If the Minister changes the law, he should not be surprised if those who can take advantage of it seek to do so.

A potentially valuable property with sitting tenants in it with secure tenancies can be bought at the appropriate valuation and translated overnight into a property with an insecure tenancy. In other words, the tenant has sacrificed the lot if he signs on the dotted line and the transaction goes through—He has moved from being a secure tenant with a fair rent to being an insecure tenant with a prospect of high rents and eviction. As a result of that insecurity, the value of the property will immediately go up and the acquiring landlord stands to make a windfall gain. We shall come to a number of these points on future amendments, but in those circumstances it will be worth a landlord's while to offer inducements which might at first sight seem very attractive. If a landlord has the prospect of getting vacant possession in a few years of a potentially valuable property because of the insecurity built into the assured tenancy system, it will be worth his while to front-load the transaction by offering inducements whether in cash, rent-free periods, holidays abroad or goodness knows what else. That is quite likely to happen. The Minister is opening the door to such practices, and my hon.Friend was right to warn that tenants could easily be led astray.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that it is our business to warn tenants of the dangers, as no doubt Citizens Advice Bureaux and others will try to do. My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South raised the point and the Minister helpfully rose to his feet and said that if there was any abuse of this type of practice it would be a criminal offence—it would be bribery and something could be done about it. We were all rather encouraged by that, but since then the Minister has back-tracked like mad. He now says that it would not be like that after all. It would be useful to know what the Government think of their own Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood (Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to take part in this debate, but we have stumbled across an important point. I wish to ask a simple question which will no doubt make the Minister track even further backwards if that is the direction in which he is heading. If Scottish Homes found that people were going around with substantial financial inducements in their back pockets and operating in the way
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0673">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1081</span>
described, would such people continue as approved landlords or would Scottish Homes consider that to be the sort of activity that would deem them to be disapproved forthwith?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Scottish Homes will have both an approval role and a monitoring role. It will approve landlords who wish tenants to use their right to transfer to them and it will also monitor that role. I emphasise that Scottish Homes will look carefully at the operation of the Bill once it becomes an Act and act accordingly. I have been asked what the sanction would be. The sanction would be withdrawal from Scottish Homes as a receiving landlord.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has confused the Committee this morning by giving directly opposite answers to the same question. He suggests that inducements can be a corrupt practice and an abuse. He then suggests that inducements are allowable under the Bill. He seems to be suggesting that any inducement offered by a landlord must be linked to something. He gave the unlikely example of a council house with a doctor's surgery in the front room and said that in most circumstances a landlord could offer an inducement, presumably to make a capital gain on the doctor's surgery. He also said that the landlord could give an inducement if renovation was being carried out and a great deal of nuisance was caused to the tenant as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister seems to be suggesting that inducements are allowed under the Bill only when they are in compensation for something which is completely separate from the landlord gaining ownership of the house. If any other inducement is offered, it is a corrupt practice and an abuse, and Scottish Homes will clamp down on it. I hope that the Minister will explain to the Committee the mechanism for policing that aspect of the transaction. Will the tenant go to Scottish Homes and complain, or will Scottish Homes look at every transaction to make sure no illegal inducements were offered? Will inspectors be employed to do that? How will it work? The Minister must explain this carefully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must emphasise that valuable assets are on offer. The Minister could not put a value on the Scottish housing stock if he were pressed to do so in Committee. These are very valuable assets and they will represent a cheap acquisition for the landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr Home Robertson) pointed out, the valuation will be the valuation with a secure sitting tenant, which clearly depresses the price, but thereafter the tenancy will become an assured tenancy, which is less secure. The landlord acquires a variety of rights in relation to increases in rent, and so on, to the detriment of the tenant, so very valuable assets will be transferred. The Minister has confused the Committee with his reference to the criminal law, because as far as I can see it will not apply in these circumstances, unless landlords cut across other
	<span class='label label-info column'>1082</span>
boundaries, which we are not suggesting here, although we fear that potential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not worried simply about landlords acquiring assets on the cheap and the tenants having to pay for that at the end of the day, regardless of any inducements which may provide a short-term benefit. I am worried about what will happen when landlords twig what benefit there is in the Bill for them and when there is competition between landlords. Housing schemes will be polluted not only by icecream vans; but by prowling landlords looking to pick up tenants at the cheapest possible price. I am worried about the possible effect of that on the market, because we are opening up a can of worms. The Opposition have made the point forcefully that this measure has not been thought through, as this morning's debate has shown yet again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We expect that a tenant contemplating a transfer would agree to the transfer proceeding only if he received a satisfactory undertaking from the landlord, preferably in the form of a contractual agreement, that the works contemplated in the amendment would be undertaken in a reasonable short period. These are matters for common sense and agreement. I cannot envisage every possible set of circumstances that may arise. What takes place will be judged very much on the facts and circumstances which obtain and on attitude of Scottish Homes, which as both an approval role and a monitoring role.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has again failed to answer the question. Is it illegal for private sector landlords to offer inducements to gain possession of district council houses? He must answer yes or no. He seemed to suggest at one stage that it was not legally acceptable for any private sector landlord to offer a holiday or a cash inducement as a means of gaining control of a district council house. Will he answer the question now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not illegal. The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) knows the criminal law well. Whether something is a criminal act depends on the facts and circumstances surrounding the allegations which are made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is not illegal, does the Minister consider it acceptable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That depends on the facts and circumstances surrounding the case. I cannot envisage every circumstance that might arise, but I believe that it is important for Scottish Homes to have both a monitoring and an approval role. If what are commonly judged to be improper activities are taking place, the sanction is that approval will be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As usual, the Minister has not answered the Opposition's legitimate questions. He says that he cannot possibly imagine every conceivable cicrumstance, but what happens if a landlord offers to the tenant £1,000 over the district valuer's valuation of a property? Does the Minister

	<span class='label label-info column'>1083</span>
accept that that is a legitimate way for private sector landlords to gain control of district council houses? He must answer yes or no.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There would be nothing illegal about it, but I should be surprised if such activities took place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Roberston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is wet behind the ears.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister might be surprised about such activities but would Scottish Homes do anything about it? If a private sector landlord indulges in such practices, will the Minister authorise it? Will the Minister please clarify his position?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be dependent upon the circumstances of the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot withdraw the amendment because the Minister has failed to answer the Opposition's legitimate concerns that there will be abuse by private sector landlords. The Minister knows that to build for the private rented property sector is not an economical proposition in Scotland at present. It is cheaper to get control of property by in effect, stealing it from the district councils. The Minister is allowing that in order to help the private sector gain a part of the rented housing market in Scotland. We want private sector landlords to be controlled by Scottish Homes. The Government have shown themselves incapable of doing that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have exposed the fact that it will be not only possible but likely that tenants will be offered inducements to sign on the dotted line to give consent to an acquiring landlord to make an approach to a public sector landlord to buy their house. We want to establish safeguards so that, having made the initial consent, tenants will be able to get information about the implications of the consent and what will happen if the transaction goes through and be able to extricate themselves from the trap if they wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 558 clarifies the point that the initial consent given by the tenant is only one of interest and merely allows an approach to the existing landlord to be made. It should not be until a much later stage, for example after a future rent has been determined, that the tenant gives formal consent for the transaction to be concluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister objected during the last sitting of the Committee to my use of the term "trick a tenant" when referring to this part of the Bill as an alternative phrase to "pick a landlord". We have noticed that the Bill gives the right to initiate the process not to the tenant but to the acquiring landlord—first, to be approved by Scottish Homes and then to tout around to get tenants to sign on the dotted line and enter into one-sided negotiations with the local authority. It creates rights for the private sector to acquire property with only the most rudimentary of safeguards for the tenants, who could find themselves in difficulty if the legislation is passed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment gives the Minister the opportunity to show whether he wants to protect tenants from fast-talking speculators. From what we have heard, we conclude that he is happy to stand back and allow touts to offer inducements to persuade tenants to sign bits of paper without any certainty that they will be warned about the difficulties that may ensue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know about being approached to sign official forms. How often have members of the Committee visited the dentist because they have toothache and been presented before treatment with a form covered in small print, on which the receptionist has indicated the places for signatures with crosses? It would take half an hour to read the small print and so we sign the form on the assumption that everything will be all right.

My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) has shown that it will be possible for representatives of a private developer to turn up on doorsteps with glossy brochures offering holidays abroad, cash inducements and all manner of bright things in the future in return for a signature. It may seem attractive to a tenant in the short term if he is facing financial difficulties. He will be pleased to find that he will get £1,000 or £2,000—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—BUPA membership or goodness knows what else. He will sign and begin to get the inducements. If the tenant does not actively stop the process, as mercifully he can—I acknowledge that that is possible under subsection (4)(b)—the signature given to the representative of the acquiring landlord can be irrevocable. The tenant has to intervene actively to block the procedure at a later date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 559 seeks to ensure that the tenant is genuinely aware of the distinction between secure public sector tenancies with a fair rent and the serious threat of high rent, insecurity and eviction that is inherent in the assured tenancy system to which he will move if the transaction is completed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments have been suggested by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities which is worried not only about the welfare of their tenants but about the likelihood of being required to rehouse people when things go wrong. If the scenario that we have described came about and if all the tenants in a potentially valuable building were to sign on the dotted line and the landlord then imposed terms of an assured tenancy which meant that the tenure would be concluded at a relatively early date or imposed rents that were so high that tenants could not afford them, the local authority would have to house the tenants whether or not it had any housing stock left to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Consumer Council has expressed anxieties too, although it is not normally associated with Socialist initiatives—it does find work, however, in protecting consumers in Scotland. It has suggested amendment No. 536, to ensure that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"before giving his or her individual consent to the application, each tenant should have been properly consulted by the applicant concerning future arrangements for the management and occupancy of the property."</p></blockquote>
The Scottish Consumer Council says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Tenants will rquire an adequate basis on which to decide whether it is to their advantage or disadvantage to transfer to a new landlord. Tenants will need to be well informed and consulted about the new landlord's future arrangements, with particular regard to proposed rents, conditions of tenancy, and services such as repairs, and tenants rights (for example, sub-letting). There is no guarantee in the clause as it stands that tenants will have been properly informed and consulted before the prospective new landlord applies to take over the property. Regulations could stipulate what information about proposed rents, conditions of tenancy, and so on should be issued to tenants before an application is lodged. They should also stipulate the practices and procedures for consulting tenants, for example requiring prospective applicants to invite tenants to meetings to discuss the application and its implications. The regulations could prescribe a 'cooling off' period over which consultations ought to take place before an application is lodged, say a period of 2 months. These consultations should leave tenants in no doubt as to whether they should give their consent to a change of landlord. These consultations should be supplemented by advice and information from Scottish Homes underlying the implications of opting for a change of landlord and helping tenants to assess critically the advice and information supplied by prospective appicants."</p></blockquote>
The Scottish Consumer Council is clearly very anxious that tenants could be encouraged to grant their consent to radical changes that could affect their future security and conditions without knowing what they were letting themselves in for. I commend the amendment to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1086</span>
Amendment No. 503 stands in the name of the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood), but it came from the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations. Labour Members associate themselves with the objectives outlined in the amendment. It would ensure that tenants receive comprehensive information to enable them to make an informed decision on whether they wish to transfer to an alternative landlord. As it stands:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Bill makes no provision for tenants to receive any information to allow them to make an informed decision on whether or not to agree to the potential landlords application."</p></blockquote>
The Scottish Federation of Housing Associations' interest in this amendment arises from the Minister's statement that he expects housing associations to be likely to be the most common receiving landlords under this provision. The SFHA says that it is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"anxious to ensure that tenants in the public sector who are considering a transfer to a housing association or co-operative are fully informed about the alternative landlord in advance of any binding decision being made. It would seem that tenants wishing to transfer under the terms of this part of the Act are able to do so only once. It is, therefore, essential that they are fully informed about the implications of a transfer before they decide to move from the public to the independent rented sector,"</p></blockquote>
and the insecurity and difficulties that that would engender.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SFHA also emphasises the great importance that it attaches to continuing co-operation with local authorities in Scotland. Housing associations in Scotland have a very close relationship with local housing authorities and have traditionally worked closely with them. It has a strong interest in ensuring that there should be no misunderstandings in the exercise of this part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already acknowledged the presence in the Bill of subsection 4(b), which makes it possible for tenants to withdraw from this process. We should be thankful for small mercies. It would, however, be more appropriate if the initial consent could be for the acquiring landlord to make an approach to the tenants's existing landlord. The tenant would then have positively to endorse any further progress with that transaction. It should not be left at that, because a tenant might not be aware of his right to halt the process and stay in his secured tenancy with the public sector landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The procedure outlined in the Bill is not good enough. There are not enough safeguards, nor does it acknowledge that most tenants in Scotland, whether in the public or private sector, want a good landlord with good practices, a fair rent and to have their repairs carried out on time and to a proper standard. They are not fussy about whether they are in the public or the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We come back to the fundamental gimmickry of part III. I am seriously worried that tenants could be induced to sign a blank cheque under this provision. They may not be aware that they can withdraw that blank cheque before it is too late. If they are honest when they make statements about wanting to extend choice for tenants, the Government should ensure that tenants have proper protection against the abuses that we have debated this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

membership. It is not so far-fetched because, the deeper one goes into the debate, the more ludicrous it becomes. When that remark was made, the thought of landlords approaching elderly tenants with offers of assistance with hospital costs passed through my mind. We know how difficult it is to get health care in some parts of the country. It is not so far from the bounds of possibility that a hip replacement could be the kind of inducement which would bring about the handing over of a very valuable tenancy by an elderly tenant who will not be there for much longer. That factor would play in a landlord's mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Landlords are bound to concentrate on houses which tend to be occupied by older members of the community and which are the more solid and desirable houses. I can think of some of the older schemes in my constituency, all granite built and very attractive properties, tenanted by older people who would be very susceptible to sales talk. It concerns me because they would be the initial targets. Their property would be the most valuable in the long and short term. In the short term, it would attract a rent that in many cases would be paid for by housing benefit or by some of the better-off tenants. When the tenant dies, there is no guarantee that the spouse would be allowed to stay. Clearly, the Government have removed that possibility from some categories of tenant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way? Will he acknowledge that there is also the possibility of a form of harassment? My hon. Friend the Member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram) has already experienced a knock on the door at 1 a.m. from the Scottish Office in connection with the Bill. People could be very persistent and pester people and ask them to sign documents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Governments of all parties recognise the threat of door-to-door salesmanship. They have written in protections to hire purchase legislation. In consumer credit arrangements, there is a cooling off period, and in certain insurance contracts there are cooling off periods that apply if a sale takes place at a person's home. The Government are about to introduce the very rigid and stringent provisions of the Financial Services Act 1987 that control money lending and those who give financial advice. I fail to see why all these matters are subject to strictures whilst tenants are wide open to exploitation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are no controls on the predatory landlord who wants to encourage tenants through his agents. One can imagine a team of salesmen sent out to a housing scheme on commission, required to persuade as many tenants as possible. They are given a certain amount of flexibility. It does not have to come from the landlord—it can come from his employees. These people are let loose, particularly among residents in the more valuable properties. There are no regulations at all. I do not see why the financial, hire purchase and insurance markets need to be regulated and why the very valuable commodity of a person's home, the roof over one's head, is not regulated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The controls are limited. The tenant has the ability to withdraw his consent, but we do not know how
	<span class='label label-info column'>1088</span>
that is to be formalised. We know that the Secretary of State will produce a form of letter by regulation. We do not know whether that will include a provision that the tenant is to be notified of his right to withdraw or given the facility. For example, attached to the form could be a tear-off letter that he could sent to withdraw his consent. There are no controls at all at present, but there is a wide open gap, and it will be exploited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This scheme is the triumph of hope over experience, because nothing that the Minister has said suggests that there is any basis in reality for it. There is an assumption that landlords will be fair and that because Scottish Homes will require to approve them, that will induce fairness into the market. It will not work. It is a mess.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) said, I have an amendment in the group, amendment No. 503. In order to avoid doubt, and having regard to recent events, I say now that I do not necessarily intend to press it to a Division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main point was made by the hon. Member for East Lothian. There is a need to provide information, because the tenants who are being asked to confront this question are in a difficult position and could easily prejudice their own legal rights in the decisions that they take. Therefore, it is important to have as much information objectively produced as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister can adduce in his favour the provisions of clause 2(2)(e), which, under the general functions of Scottish Homes, explicitly provides measures to
	<br><blockquote><p>"assist in the provision of advisory or other services or facilities for any person".</p></blockquote>
In the light of our earlier discussions, has the Minister had any further thoughts about putting some flesh on the bones as to exactly what that means?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is any provision now to be made available for financing the material that we are considering in amendment No. 503? The hon. Member for East Lothian perhaps did not emphasise enough the point about continuing co-operation between housing associations and local authorities. Real benefit is to be derived from considering building on the co-operation that has been achieved to date and from having the joint production of material and information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the housing associations could get their heads together with the local authorities and agree a basis for producing information that would go to tenants who were considering making a once and for all move from the public sector into the housing association sector, there would be a much better chance of that information being thoroughly objective, and researched and worked out by both sides so that there would be no dispute between them. There could therefore be no case that either the local authority or the housing association was being parti pris to any question that arose during the proposed transfer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a potential for local authorities to fall out with housing associations as a result of some of those
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0677">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1089</span>
provisions unless we get it right. Amendment No. 503 does not specifically require local authorities and housing associations to put their heads together in the way that I am suggesting, but I hope that the Minister will make it clear that it will be possible for local authorities and housing associations to co-operate in order to produce that information. Perhaps he will go further, and say that not only will it be possible for that to happen and that Scottish Homes will not stand in its way, but that Scottish Homes will actively promote and take the initiative in getting local authorities and housing associations together where transfers were being considered. If he does, that would substantially reassure the Scottish federation of Housing Associations and the local authorities, who feel that there is potential for confusion and harm resulting to tenants who are considering making the move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) has acknowledged, there are two stages. As the transfer of property will be between one landlord and another, the right must be given to the acquiring landlord, but the tenant would have to agree first to the original approach and secondly to the final lease. Therefore, it is a transfer that cannot possibly take place without the tenant's agreement, and, of course, the tenant can initiate the whole process by approaching a new landlord himself or herself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) said that there are no controls in the Bill. The whole approval process through which landlords have to pass is a control system, which will debar landlords who cannot be trusted to deal fairly with tenants from any involvement in tenants' choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) asked about provision of information. There will be a Scottish Development Department publicity campaign, which will give advice on the effects of changing landlords, but Scottish Homes specifically will also offer advice. The hon. Gentleman asked whether there would be sufficient finance, and I have repeatedly stated since last summer that I envisage Scottish Homes as being a strongly resourced body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked what form the letter would take. The form of application would have to be in accordance with that prescribed under clause 53(1). I was also asked about co-operation between local authorities and housing associations. The answer to that is emphatically yes. Scottish Homes can encourage local authorities and housing associations to get together, and I would expect it to do so. The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South, in a light-hearted reference, mentioned hip replacements. Offering hip replacements would be outside a housing association's permitted objects. I would expect that in genuine cases, not only would Scottish Homes, local authorities and housing associations work in co-operation, but other agencies, like health boards, would be involved, and legitimate matters of need would be taken up as required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If accepted, amendments Nos. 559, 536 and 503, would gum up the process of pursuing tenants' choice
	<span class='label label-info column'>1090</span>
applications to such an extent that virtually no new landlord and no tenant would have the stamina to carry through an application successfully. I do not believe that the Committee will find the amendments acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see less objection to amendment No. 558 from the hon. Member for East Lothian. The wording suggested describes in rather more detail the precise intention of the provision. I do not think that the extra wording is necessarily required, but if the hon. Gentleman seeks to press amendment No. 558, I shall certainly accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is probably rather likely. What is more, he might try to press something else as well. Talk about gumming up the process of tenants' choice really is so much drivel. This process has precious little to do with tenants' choice and everything to do with facilitating the acquisition of potentially valuable property on the cheap by the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the tenant would have to endorse the initial application made by the acquiring landlord, and that we accept. We have dwelt for some time on the circumstances in which such consent might be likely to be given, with the inducements and so on that are likely to take place. He then said that the tenant would actively have to agree to the lease. I am not sure that the Minister has the chronology of the process right. As I understand it, the inital consent granted by the tenant for the acquiring landlord to make an approach to the public sector landlord, provided it is not withdrawn, can make it possible for the entire transaction to go through and for the new acquiring landlord to have possession of the property. At that stage the tenant has to negotiate terms with the acquiring landlord under the assured tenancy procedure, which can be changed from time to time. We have heard the fiction about freely negotiated rent and terms between the landlord and the tenant, but we have already dealt with the fact that freedom of negotiation in such circumstances may not be quite what it seems. In Scotland rented housing is a sellers' market. In view of the advantages built into the new assured tenancy system for the landlord, it is likely that the terms will not be strictly advantageous to the tenant. Perhaps the Minister will put us right on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We feel strongly that it should be possible for the tenant to have an opportunity to withhold his consent from the second stage of negotiations between the acquiring landlord and the public sector landlord. That should be written into the Bill, and we want to press for it. The Minister might describe that as gumming up the process of tenants' choice; we would describe it as giving a tenant an opportunity to have a direct say in the process by which an acquisitive private sector landlord acquires from the public sector the home in which that tenant lives. I would not call that a gumming-up process. It is a process for establishing genuine tenants' choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the fact that the Minister is willing to accept amendment No. 558, which is half a step in the right direction. I should like to have gone further, and I feel that there is a case for giving further
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0678">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1091</span>
consideration to the other amendments in the group. I remain profoundly unimpressed by the Minister's assurances about the practices that may be adopted by acquiring private sector landlords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not talking about housing associations. In the past, there has been an excellent relationship between local authorities and housing associations. The Opposition want that to continue to flourish, but the. mechanism which we are debating has been a basis for conflict and friction in the past and the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations has expressed fear about the difficulties that could arise in the future. That is another reason why I should like to continue the debate for a little longer. I should be grateful if the Minister could explain how a tenant will have an active, positive opportunity to consider and block the process if he wants to do so. Am I not right in saying that, provided it is not actively withdrawn by the tenant, the initial consent could make it possible for the entire transaction to go through?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is absolutely inaccurate in that assertion. As I said earlier, tenants would still have to agree to the terms of their new lease with the proposed new landlord. If the tenant were not happy with the terms of the proposed lease, the transaction would not proceed. Clause 55(2) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A notice of acceptance under subsection (1) above is of no effect unless the qualifying tenant and the applicant have concluded a lease of the house for a period subsequent to the sale of the house in pursuance of this Part of this Act, being a lease which is conditional upon that sale proceeding."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said earlier that the Government would carry out a publicity campaign on television and in other ways to tell tenants about their rights. Will it be part of that campaign to explain to tenants exactly what is involved in the new concept of an assured tenancy and how that leaves tenants in a much weaker position than they are at present? Will it be made absolutely clear to tenants what is involved, compared with the present arrangements?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I mentioned, Scottish Homes will play an active part in this process in due course. After the passing of the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act there was an SDD publicity campaign, and I expect that those precedents will be followed again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not satisfied from the Minister's earlier explanation that this will allow effective protection for individuals who are considering making the change. It would be helpful if he would confirm what I am almost cast-iron certain about that any tenant considering the detail of a lease in the expectation of a change would be eligible under the legal advice and assistance scheme for at least up to £25 worth of work, and that the Scottish Legal Aid board would not object in any circumstances to a tenant getting assistance from a qualified solicitor on that specific matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would be governed by all the existing legal aid rules which
	<span class='label label-info column'>1092</span>
are administered by the Scottish Legal Aid board. Clearly, it would depend on the person's circumstances, but I should imagine that a large proportion of tenants would qualify.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for drawing attention to clause 55(2) and relating it to the earlier clause. That seems to clarify the point that it will at least be necessary for the terms of a new assured tenancy lease to be agreed before the transaction can be completed. That was not clear in my mind at the outset. I thought that it would have been a seperate point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The addition of amendment No. 558 to the Bill would be helpful in that it would clarify matters. The initial consent would allow for negotiation between the acquiring landlord and the public sector landlord and there would be further opportunities for the tenant, either passively or actively, to block or alter the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 559 would be an extremely relevant addition to the Bill. It would specifically ensure that a tenant was actively informed of the consequences for his security of tenure and his future rent payments of the transfer from a secure tenancy in the public sector to an assured tenancy in the private sector. We cannot rely on private sector acquisitors, who are likely to go around touting for houses, to warn tenants of the different terms that are likely to apply to them in the future. No doubt local authorities would try to give people fair warning on that point but I think that, given the fundamental nature of the process described here, that could usefully be built into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that the Scottish Consumer Council and the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations have raised these concerns about this part of the Bill shows that there are legitimate worries about the distinct possibility that tenants could sign away important rights without being genuinely aware of what they were letting themselves in for. That could give rise to difficulties for tenants and to serious friction between, for example, housing associations and local authorities. If the Minister wants to be constructive about future housing policy, he should not build such flaws into the system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 538, in page 32, line 26, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(c) accompanied by:
	<ol>
	<li>a draft lease.</li>
	<li>a statement about the proposed levels of rent for particular types of property.</li>
	<li>written details of the management services to be provided".</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
The Government's notes on clause 53 say that the clause
	<br><blockquote><p>"sets out the detailed procedures for exercising the right to acquire public sector property".</p></blockquote>
The amendment is necessary because the procedures are not detailed enough. Under subsection(1) all that is required is a statement from The landlord seeking to exercise his right under the Bill as well as the consent in writing from the qualifying tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0679">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1093</span>
The Minister pointed out in a previous debate that it will also be necessary under clause 55(2) for the landlord and tenant to agree a lease under the landlord's new ownership of the property. I still believe that that is a wholly inadequate basis for carrying out an important transaction. As the Opposition have repeatedly said, the landlord is gaining control of a valuable asset at a cheap price—a subsidised price, because of the difference between the district valuer's valuation of a property with a sitting tenant under a protected tenancy and the real value under the conditons of an assured tenancy at a market rent, with less security for the tenant. It is a subsidised way for private sector landlords to gain control of public sector property. At the same time the tenants asked to surrender important rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to beef up this part of the Bill by requiring the landlord to supply a draft lease, which can be inspected by all the bodies concerned. He will be expected also to supply a statement that sets out the proposed rent levels for the type of property involved, and written details of the management services that he will supply to the tenants. That information will be available not only to the tenants but to all the other bodies concerned, including Scottish Homes and the district council that is asked to sell the property to the landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all very well for the Minister to say that tenants will have to agree to anything that happens. Tenants are not always experts on housing legislation and rights and the complexities of housing legislation. They could often do with the assistance and support of expert bodies—Scottish Homes, certainly, but also the district councils that were the previous landlords. The Government try continually to paint district councils in the worst possible light, saying that they ignore tenants' needs and exploit them and fail to be good landlords. That is an unfortunate stance to take. District councils take their responsibilities seriously and concern themselves with tenants' welfare. All of them will be concerned that the rights of the tenants are properly looked after in any transactions under the clause. It is therefore important that an amendment such as this be carried so that district councils can play their part, along with Scottish Homes, in ensuring that tenants' rights are properly protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An offer of sale could be conditional upon the new landlord undertaking to carry out certain types of repair beyond what was legally required of him, or he might be asked to provide for a degree of tenant participation or consultation in housing management decisions. A district council or Scottish Homes could add such conditions to the transaction between the landlord and the tenant, but the tenant on his own might not ask for them. They are important gains that cold be won for the tenant. Scottish Homes could play an important role in drawing up model conditions of tenancy and management services to which landlords would be expected to have regard in making offers and conditions of sale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to create a role for the public sector in this transaction, that role being to defend the rights of the tenant against any possible
	<span class='label label-info column'>1094</span>
undermining by the private sector landlord in ways that have been described. It is not enough to leave the tenant at the whims and mercy of a one-to-one relationship with the new acquiring landlord. There must be someone who is expert in the subject to support the tenant. That support should come not only from Scottish Homes but from the district councils that are giving up ownership of the properties, while at the same time seeking to ensure that tenants' rights are properly protected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The dfficulty with the amendment relates to its practicability. At first glance, the terms of amendment No. 538 might appear reasonable and desirable, but the amendment is not practicable. It seeks to require a prospective landlord to intimate to the qualifying tenant, almost at the outset of the process of transfer, details that cannot possibly be ascertained until much later in the procedures. Much of what a prospective landlord will eventually be able to offer by way of management services and rent levels will hinge on the price that the new landlord has to pay to acquire the property. That figure will, however, not be known when the prospective landlord makes his application to acquire. Difficulties would also arise in drafting other details of a leasing agreement at that early stage. For those reasons, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seems to be saying that it all revolves round whether at the outset the private sector landlord will have any idea of the likely price of the house that he wishes to purchase from the district council. As I understand it, the price will be determined by the district valuation of that property, which is easily found out. People know the value of most district council properties. If a private sector landlord were interested in buying a house, he would know closely what he would be asked to pay for it. The Minister's case does not stand up. If he can explain why the private sector landlord would not know the price at the outset of the negotiations, I may consider his request.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I can do that. Basically, the type of information that the amendment requires to be provided could only be very general, since many of the details would have to be settled between the landlord and the applicant before the latter could be in a position to draw up with any precision leasing agreement. The market value would depend on what was on offer. That could easily include the details of the management services to be offered. Until the landlord responded to the applicant, the prospective new landlord would not have accurate information on the rights and obligations attached to the property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the amendement is unncessary for entirely different reasons. Clause 55(2) states that the tenant has to sign the lease before the transaction can be finalised. At that stage that details of the lease would be available to the tenant. It is really a matter of timing and practicability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I have to persist. If the Minister looks at the amendment closely, he
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0680">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1095</span>
will see that it asks for a draft lease, not a detailed lease, to be made available to the public sector landlord so that he can apprise the tenant. A draft lease would show the kind of agreement into which the tenant was getting himself. We are asking for a statement about the proposed rent for that type of property, not for that particular house, with written details of the management services that the landlord is offering. If the landlord is acquiring property and does not know what kind of management services he will be offering to tenants, that should be of legitimate concern to the district council and to Scottish Homes so that they can advise the tenant. On that basis, I wish to press the amendment to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We hope that he will overcome any reservations and accept that, where a major change in housing is likely to take place, another adult in a house, who may well be the spouse or a joint tenant, or even if he or she is not a joint tenant, should also have to give his or her written consent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 550 is unnecessary, because the wording of subsection (2) makes it clear that a tenant cannot exercise the choice without the written consent of his spouse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am in considerable sympathy with the purpose of amendment No. 556, which seeks to ensure that unmarried couples have the same rights with regard to tenants' choice as married couples. I have some doubts about the amendment's wording, but I am happy to give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that I shall look further at his arguments with a view to amending the Bill appropriately later. With that assurance, I hope that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 517, in page 32, line 38, leave out "2" and insert "4".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>No. 560, in page 32, line 38, leave out "2" and insert "3".</p>
	<p>No. 525, in clause 55, page 34, line 18, leave out "2" and insert "1".</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are dealing with the time in which public sector authorities will have to respond to an application by a private sector landlord to take over a property by issuing an offer to sell within two months of the service of the application. Amendment No. 517, which was suggested by Dundee district council, suggests that that length of time is not enough and wants to have the public sector authority to have four months to set in motion the necessary work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The experience of Dundee district council leads it to believe that to comply with the existing requirements of two months, it would have to increase substantially the number of staff in order to process the likely number of applications. I am sure that the Minister would not want that to be the effect of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dundee district council also points out that district councils will be totally dependent on district valuers, giving them a timeous valuation so that they can process it within the two months. That is not always likely to be possible. There may be delays on the part of the district valuer, making it impossible for the district council to comply with the two-month requirement. Therefore the council is seeking this sensible change from two months to four months to allow it to comply properly with the new requirements that will be placed on councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although amendment No. 560 asks that the two months be changed to three months, as in the English Housing Bill, I ask the Minister to accept the amendment proposed by Dundee district council and give councils four months rather than two months to put into operation this part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret that, although I listened carefully to the hon. Member for
	<span class='label label-info column'>1098</span>
Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion), I cannot accept these amendments. Amendments Nos. 517 and 560 seek to extend to four or three months the period within which the landlord must serve an offer to sell on the applicant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 525 seeks to reduce to one month the period within which the applicant, if he does not dispute the terms of the offer to sell, must serve a notice of acceptance on the landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The various stages in these tenants' choice procedures, as hon. Members have observed, have been modelled closely on the right to buy provisions contained in part III of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987. The time limits applicable to right-to-buy procedures have presented no overwhelming difficulties so far to local authorities. We therefore consider it appropriate to apply the same limits to tenants' choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have considered representations made by a number of authorities on the two-month period for responses to applications to purchase. I remain convinced, however, that if the new tenants' choice arrangements are to work effectively, there should be no scope for public sector landlords to delay the process unduly. I think that two months is sufficient time for the landlord to react as required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 525, I believe that it would be desirable to continue to allow the two-month period that the Bill proposes. The notice of acceptance will be invalid unless the landlord and the new tenant have concluded a lease conditional on the sale proceeding. It is reasonable to allow two months for this to be done properly. If the hon. Gentleman seeks to press the matter, I shall reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed by the Minister's answer. In no way is the amendment a wrecking amendment for district councils to try to frustrate what the Government are trying to achieve in the clause. It is a genuine request from district councils that face the prospect of trying to process the applications in the time given and fear that they will be unable to do so. Extending the period from two to three months not only provides for a repetition of what now exists in England and Wales under English housing legislation—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that there is a block transfer in England and Wales and that the circumstances in which the issue is handled are different? the English legislation is not identical to the Scottish Bill in that respect. We are not talking about a block transfer in these provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the Minister's point, but in no way would it damage the intention of the clause to extend the time to two, three or four months. If we were asking for a year, I can see the point that the Minister is trying to make; but that is not the case. This is a genuine attempt to give the councils time to meet the requirements placed on them by the Bill. The Minister has shown that he is not prepared to concede, and, although I am disappointed, rather than delay the Committee further—I realise that

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that, when the Minister contributes to the debate, he will make it clear that there was an embargo on the press until a later time briefing than the time of delivery to the Committee.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be of assistance to members of the Committee, in view of the parallels that have been drawn between right to buy and and tenants' choice arrangements in the 1987 Act and in the Bill, if in responding to the debate on whether there should be an outstanding debt test on tenants' choice transfers, I were to announce the Government's decision on the arrangements for a right-to-buy cost floor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1100</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me finish the statement. We shall have full debate thereafter. As members of the Committee will be aware, our White Paper, "Housing: The Government's Proposals for Scotland" stated our intention to discontinue the outstanding debt provisions which can restrict the discounts that some tenants can obtain when they exercise their right to buy their council houses. These restrictions are a disincentive to tenants to exercise their right to buy. A number of interested organisations, individual local authorities and housing associations, expressed their concern at this proposal. In the light of comments received, my right honourable and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland advised the House during the debate on Second Reading that he was giving further consideration to this point and that he hoped to be able in the reasonably near future to reach a conclusion on whether to proceed with the announced policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will wish to know that we have now concluded that the right-to-buy discount restrictions should not be abolished completely. We shall instead seek to amend the current provisions. We intend that the right-to-buy selling price will be no lower than the total of actual costs incurred in providing or improving the house over approximately five years before the application is made. Put another way, we aim to introduce a five-year rolling cut-off date and to replace the outstanding debt test with an historic cost floor arrangement. These changes will make it easier for public sector landlords to identify relevant costs and will remove anomalies thrown up in the past where two houses of similar age and cost fell to be treated differently if one were financed from receipts and the other from borrowing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We intend later to table detailed amendments to the Bill, but I thought that it would assist the Committee if I made clear at this stage our policy intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suppose that we must be grateful for small mercies. The Secretary of State said that he would address his mind to this important matter in Committee. I suppose that, since he is in the Committee, we may cross-examine the Minister about the full extent of the Government's proposal. I shall want to study in detail the Government's plans, but will the Minister confirm some matters in his statement that I may have missed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main objection to the announced intentions of the Secretary of State on Second Reading was that, if properties could be sold at less than their remaining debt, it was unreasonable that the remaining tenants should pay the balance. They would be subsidising other people. That has always been the fear of local authorities. Will the proposals mean that local authorities will not be left to pick up any debt or any of the other costs associated with losing stock from these sales?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0683">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1101</span>
In the Bill as drafted, there are details of the price and conditions for the transfer of a property that will be assessed by the district valuer, who, in deciding the price, will take a series of factors into consideration. He will take account of the fact that the property is the subject of a secure tenancy, despite the fact that after the transfer it will become an assured tenancy. That knocks an amount off the capital value of the property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The remedial works required to put the house into the state of repair demanded by the landlord's repairing obligation will also knock capital value off the property. Finally, there are no other buyers on the scene. The district valuer will be obliged to consider that, and it will reduce the capital value of the property. Some of the properties that we are considering could end up with a substantial negative value. If the stock was transferred on that basis, it would mean that there would be a transfer of value from the old to the new landlord. That is in addition to any loan residue remaining the responsibility of the local authority or the new town. These are substantial questions to which we require detailed answers from the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Substantially, the objection more than anything else is that if the provisions are used to any extent—or if there is an increase in the percentage of uptake of the rights that the Minister has announced this morning—it will drive a coach and horses through the ability of local authorities to plan the provision of the housing stock in their areas. What does the Minister say about that? What discussions had there been with the local authorities and other interested parties before the announcement this morning? Substantial difficulties will be caused if there is an increase in uptake, and the stock available to local authorities will be decimated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I undertstand that there is still the one third provision protection, particularly in rural areas, but in reality that is scant protection. The Minister will need to do more to persuade us that this is fair, that other people will not have to carry the financial can for the changes that the Minister has announced, and that local authorities will be able to continue their function of providing strategic overall guidance and control of housing throughout the length and breadth of Scotland. Unless he satisfies the Committee on those points, there will be widespread disappointment at the effect his proposals may have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister has clearly made an important statement to the Committee this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Have you been at the press briefing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been in the Committee all morning, as the hon. Member is fully aware. I welcomed the intention in the White Paper to remove the cost-floor restrictions, while recognising fully that it is a complex area because of the financial consequences of any change. I think I understand the Minister's statement, but it is a complex matter. I welcome the intentions of the Government and the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1102</span>
idea of a five-year rolling cut-off, which I think is sensible. However, it might be for the benefit of the Committee if my hon. Friend the Minister could say something about how many tenants would in practice be affected by the change in the provisions. This is of particular importance in some areas such as urban new towns. My hon. Friend the Minister may not have the figures available, but it would be helpful to the Committee if he could give some idea of how many tenants are likely to be affected over the five-year rolling period mentioned, so that the Committee could make a judgment as to the consequences of his important statement this morning for tenants in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I tried to intervene in the Minister's opening remarks. I wish he would stop describing this mechanism as tenants' choice. The mechanism has nothing to do with tenants' choice—it is a private landlords' lucky dip. The Minister is treating the Committee with increasingly characteristic contempt, and that is shown by the way in which he has presented this package today. The press conveniently had advance warning of it, and the Minister took the opportunity of a debate initiated by Opposition Members to make a statement which will have far-reaching implications for public sector housing provision—and for the remaining tenants in the public sector—in Scotland. The Minister took some time to read out the term "five-year rolling cut-off date", which I managed to write down. There was then a further sentence which I have not been able to write down because he mumbled it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The actual words were:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and to replace the outstanding debt test with a historic-cost cost-floor arrangement."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: "A historic-cost cost-floor" or "cost four" arrangement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now that we have managed to get that on the record, it will take a few minutes, not only for Opposition Minister's but for the Government Minister's, and indeed for those involved in public sector housing in Scotland, to analyse precisely what that means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter was trailed by the Secretary of State for Scotland on Second Reading, when he said that it was the Government's intention to do away with the cost floor. We understand from what the Minister said just now that the Government are seeking to fudge it in some way or other, but the fact remains that under part III, acquiring landlords will be able to get bargain basement property, without a proper safeguard of the actual outstanding debts attached to the property concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One must take into account the other facts that the district valuer will have to take on board when fixing the valuation, such as that at the beginning of the process there will be a sitting tenant with a secure fair rent tenancy, and after the process has been completed that tenant will be translated into an insecure tenant in a so-called assured tenancy.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0684">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1103</span>
Overnight at that point, the acquiring landlord will make a substantial windfall again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other considerations, to which the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) referred, such as cases of outstanding repairs. Clearly, the acquiring private landlords will do very well out of this package, but there is another side of the equation to which we need to pay some attention—that is, the impact of all this on public sector landlords, the providers of housing. All of us who represent Scottish constituencies—and I recognise that that does not include all Members of the Committee—meet our constitutents regularly and they ask us how we can help them to get housing. They all, virtually without exception, start from the assumption that the best place to get housing in Scotland is in the public sector, as it has been for a long time past and as it is likely to remain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people of Scotland expect the public sector to provide housing for them, and I fear the announcement that the Minister has made today will make it even more difficult now than it has been in the past few years for public sector landlords to provide the housing that our people so desperately need. Housing waiting lists will get longer and because of other aspects of the Bill even more people will become homeless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult enough for public sector landlords to invest in new buildings, to build more houses to deal with the desperate needs of homeless people and of people stuck on housing waiting lists who are at present living in overcrowded accommodation, because of the lack of capital allocation to do the job, because of the Government's public spending constraints and also because of the fear that they will be compelled to sell that property at less than it cost them in the first place. The Minister has today confirmed those fears. From now on, public sector housing authorities, district councils or others, face the prospect that if they build houses they will be required to sell them cheap at some future date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will take some time to analyse precisely what the formula that the Minister is putting forward really means, but it is clear enough that it is bad news for the providers of public sector housing, and now it is also bad news for remaining tenants. Because no housing support grant is left for the majority of local housing authorities in Scotland, the remaining tenants will have to meet the additional cost which will be put on to the housing accounts of local authorities in Scotland whenever a neighbour's house is sold off cheap with outstanding loans still attached to it. Homeless people will suffer as a consequence of this formula, and the remaining sitting tenants of local housing authorities will have to pay higher rents to pay for the cost of this luxury that the Government are providing for a minority. Clearly that will further confuse the issue for public sector housing providers in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The manner in which the Government have brought forward this announcement on the last day of our consideration of the Bill is disgraceful. We understand that they intend to introduce an amendment either on Report or in the other place. That is symptomatic of the Government's shambolic
	<span class='label label-info column'>1104</span>
approach to the Bill and is clearly something that we shall have to debate further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I echo the sentiments expressed by my hon. Friend the Minister for East Lothian (Mr Home Robertson). My council first raised this issue in April 1987 in relation to the sale of Development Corporation houses to secure tenants. The Industry Department in the Scottish Office—the Minister responsible for that Department is yet again not here—gave an obtuse answer and simply said that it was considering the matter. That was in May, in response to a letter in April. East Kilbride district council then had to write again in September, asking the Department to respond to the questions that it had raised. That was six months after the original question on a matter of great importance. Eventually, in November, a response was given which most people in housing could not understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ask the Minister a simple question in relation to the advice issued on 21 August 1987. Does that advice stand until the Bill is amended? Is that how local authorites must react to existing legislation or will the Minister immediately issue a correction to that advice?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way in which the Government have acted is disgraceful. I want to put on record my grave concern about the fact that the press had a detailed briefing on this matter before members of the Committee had an opportunity to consider it. It is outrageous to treat Members of Parliament in this way. It would have been of benefit to local authorities and hon. Members if the Minister had been on top of the issue and had responded to correspondence already on file from East Kilbride district council, which also set out concerns on behalf of other local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The announcement made by my hon. Friend the Minister is important. Matters of this kind are never easy and Opposition Members always fail to recognise that the market place will reflect the price of property sold with a sitting tenant. I imagine that the historic-cost floor is probably about right. If a property has a tenant 	<i>in situ,</i> that is bound to affect the market value. Because Opposition Members have never understood, and still do not understand, valuations, cash flow and the difference between revenue and capital accounts accounts, they create problems for themselves and everyone else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to note the comments sent to me by the House-Builders Federation, which is pleased with the progress of the Bill. I received a letter this week from the director responsible for attempting to have a programme of houses built in the rural areas. He had read the speech that I made on Friday about problems in the rural areas. The federation is looking forward to the Bill being on the statute book, because for the first time for a long time it will have an incentive to build low-cost housing in rural areas. That is the view of a body which wants to build houses. It is waiting for two things—first, the Bill getting on the statute book and, secondly, a more realistic approach by the Government to planning approval in the rural areas. If we are to build houses
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0685">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1105</span>
for people who want to live in those areas, we must take a much more realistic approach to planning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion), who is shaking his head, does not represent a rural constituency. I cannot imagine how individuals who come from cities can hope to understand the problems that we face, because they constantly remind us that we have no knowledge of housing estates in the large cities. If they come here and say things like that, it is not unrealistic for us to question whether they fully understand the problems in the rural areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but how does he think the Bill, and the announcement that has been made this morning that adds to the Bill, will provide an incentive for local authorities to build new housing in rural areas which will be sold over their head within the time stipulated by the Minister, at an effective loss?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is simple. Unlike the hon. Gentleman, I have never believed that local authorities were the only people who could build houses, nor do they have the best record as landlords. In my experience, they have been appalling landlords. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that, as often as not, they seemed to enjoy playing a God-like role: they allocated, they decided, they determined and only they could do anything. As a result, we have the most appalling stock of houses in Scotland. The state of council properties is no credit to anyone in the public sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is straying from the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can bring the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) back on to the straight and narrow. It is always nice to have lecture on theology—from him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the hon. Gentleman explain how the provision that the Minister has just announced can encourage private builders in rural areas? What is the good of buying from the private sector when one can buy at a fraction of the price from the local authority under this compulsory purchase agreement at a bargain basement level? It is bad news for private developers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is ignoring a fundamental and important aspect. It has all come about by arrangement, by agreement and by choice. No one will hold a gun to anyone's head and say "You will have to do this" to the tenant. If a local authority's tenants decide that they want to opt out of its control—I should not be surprised if many of them wanted to because of the experience that many of them have had—there will be a dramatic change in housing. That is long overdue, because it is clear that we have not been meeting demands and needs. In many cases, the local authorities have, sadly, been found lacking and wanting, unsympathetic and uncaring and, in may cases, they have failed to
	<span class='label label-info column'>1106</span>
understand the magnitude of the problem faced individually and collectively by their tenants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not a particularly clever move on the part of the Government, nor is it unexpected. Somewhat reluctantly, they have had to give way on a number of major clauses and amendments in the interests not just of logic but of natural justice to the tenant. The Government have seen barriers put up which they believe will put off the worst type of landlord from coming in and taking advantage of the Bill. Therefore, to circumvent the effects of the restrictions that they have been forced to accept to protect tenants against harassment, soaring rent levels and the transfer of their properties … and to protect landlords and give them more inventive, they have introduced the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the Minister is breaching what I thought was parliamentary convention. It should have been a matter of courtesy for him to give the statement to my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) at least half an hour in advance, to give him a chance to ensure that we had interpreted it properly. The fact that it is confusing is demonstrated by the Minister's failure, not just once but four times, to convey to the Opposition and also to the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) the exact impact of this, and to give numbers and costs. I have worked out costs, approximately, from my experience in Edinburgh, and on those houses on which repairs to the value of between £15,000 and £20,000 have been carried out, but where those repairs were carried out more than five years ago, the house could be sold for less than the value of those repairs, leaving the remaining tenants in Edinburgh—and this is applicable throughout Scotland—with the burden of the loan debt. Will the Government give some help towards meeting the cost of servicing that loan debt? We know from the Minister's statement last week that most councils will get no help at all, no housing support grant and increasing cuts in the rate fund contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the message is clear. The impact of the clause will be to give some tenants—and not just the tenants, but the private landlords who step in to buy the houses and especially some of the houses that are empty—houses at not just bargain basement prices, but at below cost prices. The Government are breaching something that they introduced not just to reassure Opposition Members and tenants, but to reassure possible opponents of the right to buy from within Conservative authorities, where they knew that the tenants and ratepayers would be landed with the bill because houses were to be sold at less than the outstanding loan debt. The ratepayers and tenants would therefore have to pick up the tab.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the Minister has not given us a chance to brief ourselves. I am sorry that his presentation was so inadequate that almost all the members have been asking him questions about it. I am sorry that he has failed to explain it to us. Perhaps he explained it to the gentlemen of the press. We now have an opportunity to see the press notice, and I have it in my hands some three hours after the Minister handed it over to the press and, I presume,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0686">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1107</span>
his civil servants briefed the press on it. That is gross discourtesy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know of examples in Edinburgh of houses that were renovated not five but six years ago and now have an outstanding load debt of £10,000 and £15,000, which could now be handed over to a landlord at a loss to Edinburgh district council. They could be handed over to the tenant at a discount, that is greater and would take the price to less than the £10,000 outstanding in the recently incurred loan debt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the things that I understood from the Minister's somewhat garbled statement was the apparent anomaly he raised of two houses side by side where one house has had an element of repairs paid for out of capital receipts, while the other has had the repairs paid for out of borrowing and capital allocation. I shall be surprised if the Minister can give me an example of any authority that allocates money and handles its account in that way. I certainly know that in Edinburgh the programme is worked so that when the capital allocation and receipts are grossed together, they are not attributed to any one improvement programme in general but are spread around. That is a bogus example, and I think that it shows the weakness of the Minister's case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that some of my hon. Friends want to speak, but it will be worth while hearing the Minister's response and I shall certainly want to come in again after they have spoken and after I have had a chance to read the press release.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may assist the Committee if I reply at this stage. I stress at the outset that the statement that I made relates to the right to buy and not to tenants' choice or the right to transfer. We made the statement in the context of the White Paper, which was issued months ago, and we have taken into account the representations of local authorities in coming to the decision that I announced this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) asked about the effect of this on planning provision for local authorities' future building plans. I believe that it should allow local authorities to plan ahead with fear of having to sell off houses immediately. I say this because the valuation of the homes should be approximatley the same on the basis of the historic cost, which I mentioned in the statement. It will not be possible for a price to be less than the cost until the five-year period is up. By that time, the sale price is not likely to be substantially below the cost of providing or modernising property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What guarantee can the Minister give to that effect? I understand that local authorities generally finance the construction of houses with loans that are paid off over 60 years. Therefore, after five years, only a minuscule element of the loans has been paid off. If the Minister then activates this lot, after five years it will be open season. The acquiring tenants or, under the Bill, the acquiring landlords, can get it at the district valuer's valuation cheap at a bargain-basement price, but the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1108</span>
remaining tenants of the local authority will be left lumbered with that outstanding loan debt and loan charges for a further 55 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must stress that the historic cost is the actual cost of building and modernising the property since the appropriate date—and the appropriate date in this case is five years. The new provision is on historic cost, not on outstanding debt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly. You plead guilty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made the position clear in my earlier comments. With regard to the matters raised by the hon. Member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram), advice still stands until legislation is amended. It was advice from the Department and it is for local authorities to determine outstanding debt if they can do so from their records. Our advice was how they might go ahead and escalate outstanding debt if the figures on a certain house were not available. It is precisely because we recognise problems of calculating outstanding debt that we are replacing the present rule with one that takes account of historic costs, which are readily measured. The historic cost is the total actual cost of providing or modernising the house. That is the payment made by the local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer the Minister to the Scottish Development Department's of 21 August 1987. Paragraph 2 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Department cannot, of course, provide an authoritative interpretation of what is meant by 'outstanding debt' for this purpose."</p></blockquote>
That refers to the preceding paragraph. Is the Minister now saying that outstanding debt can be defined?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas- Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is precisely for that reason that we are introducing the historic cost provision rather than one based on outstanding debt. We recognised that there were problems of calculating outstanding debt. This is a much more straightforward method.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that there was no difficulty for East Kilbride development corporation with some of the new-built houses because it was paying for those houses completely out of receipts? Therefore its outstanding debt was clearly defined. Both the IDS and the SDD had been asked by East Kilbride district council to clarify how that would affect the district of East Kilbride, where the development corporation is the main house provider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that there was no outstanding debt in those cases. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to come back on that point, he is welcome to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) asked whether it was the historic cost times four. The answer is no; that is not the formula that we are adopting in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0687">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1109</span>
The hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) suggested that the homeless would suffer. The research that we have carried out has shown that those who buy their local authority houses are unlikely to move away, so the houses would not be available for reletting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One point that has been raised is that authorities may be forced to sell. Although that could happen in certain instances, authorities will be relieved of the otherwise continuing burden of management and maintenance costs. If the burden of debt on each remaining house in the authority's stock increases, an authority receiving housing support grant will receive more such grant to compensate. Where an authority does not at present receive housing support grant but the increasing outstanding debt of its houses takes average rent levels about those assumed in a housing support grant formula, it will once again come within the scope of housing support grant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it still exists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Housing support grant has increased this year, as I said earlier, precisely because we assumed in our calculations a 10 per cent. increase in management and maintenance. Thus, through subsidy arrangements, the effect on an authority's remaining tenants would be kept to a minimum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be deluding the Committee if I said that I understood what the Minister has just read, but may I make the point to him this way round? The best houses are the ones that will go—modernised and new houses. If local authorities are then left with a rump of old, run-down and decrepit stock, the unit cost of management will escalate by a large margin. Has the Minister taken that into account in his formula when working out his great new scheme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was precisely the kind of argument that was used against the right to buy when the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Bill was going through the House. In my constituency over 1,500 tenants have purchased their houses. I have been pleasantly surprised to see that those purchases were in a wide variety of council house schemes, which I have canvassed extensively—otherwise, I would not be here today. The scheme will be popular with many tenants who cannot get the full discount at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How many?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I answer in simple layman's language the question put by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood). If authorities lost out on this basis, those with housing support grant would have it adjusted accordingly. Those just outside housing support grant might come back into it. We believe that the effect on the others who are so far outside that they would not come back in would be small, but it would depend on the numbers of houses sold.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1110</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister advise the Committee what calculations his Department has done on precise numbers? How many local authorities does he believe are just outside housing support grant and how many will want to take advantage of this scheme? What is the estimated cost of bringing in the provision as against leaving things as they are?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: About 26 local authorities receive housing support grant and three or four are just below the threshold and might get back into housing support grant. That is my best assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot give an exact figure of the take-up, just as when the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Bill was going through no Minister could say how many tenants would purchase their council homes. But I believe that there will be a take-up among those directly affected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may not be able to tell us how many tenants will take advantage of this new proposal, but surely he can tell us how many houses come within the category affected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has anticipated my next points, which relate to the questions asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr Stewart) about the number of houses that will be affected by the new arrangements and by how much prices will be reduced. It is impossible to say exactly how many houses will be affected by the change, because the discounted price of any house, ignoring any cost floor which may apply, depends on the individual tenant's tenancy record. Statistics are not available relating the length of tenancy to the age of houses or the improvements carried out to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The number of public sector houses built in Scotland in 1982 and 1983, the most recent years not to be covered by the new cost floor, was below 5,000 in each year, much lower than in 1981, when the figure was 9,000 and earlier years. The average valuation for 1982 and 1983 houses in the first quarter of 1987 was £27,500. If we apply to that figure average discount of just over 50 per cent., those houses would sell at an average of about £13,000, compared with an average outstanding debt of perhaps £22,000. Therefore, the average price to the tenant, as for the houses build just before the cut-off date, will be reduced by about £9,000—a substantial amount.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Minister is claiming credit for the fact that the Government have brought about a collapse in public sector house building in Scotland. Will he confirm that the figure that he just quoted means that in the circumstances that he is describing any houses that are built will leave their tenants' neighbours—the remaining district council tenants in that area—with a £9,000 to £10,000 additional debt, for which the remaining tenants will have to pay and from which they will receive no benefit? The Minister is asking sitting
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0688">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1111</span>
tenants of Scottish district councils to subsidise those who buy their houses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the position. I explained it to the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire and I shall go through it again. Indeed the hon. Gentleman was correct to suggest that some improvements or alterations might result in some properties having a negative valuation. Authorities eligible to receive housing support grant will, in the normal course of events, receive an enhanced subsidy, because the burden of debt on each remaining house in the authority's stock will increase, if only marginally. Where an authority does not at present receive housing support grant but sales at below outstanding debt levels would take average rent levels above those assumed in the grant formula, the authority will once again come within the scope of housing support grant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take that as a firm undertaking by the Government to retain housing support grant in the long term?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1112</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly housing support grant must be retained. The hon. Gentleman made a significant speech in relation to rate fund contribution, pointing out the differences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that authorities which did not qualify for housing support grant but whole rent increases went above the Government's assumptions might come back into housing support grant. Councils like Dundee district council are well below what the Government assume their rent levels should be, so how will they be assisted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not giving a commitment to the hon. Gentleman for all time on housing support grant, nor am I in a position to do so, but I have stated accurately what the current circumstances are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
