<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are discussing the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 348, in page 59, line 10, after
<br><blockquote><p>"extent"</p></blockquote></p>
<p>insert
<br><blockquote><p>"and standard of facilities".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 349, in page 59, line 15, after
<br><blockquote><p>"character"</p></blockquote></p>
<p>insert
<br><blockquote><p>"and standard of facilities".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 350, in page 59, line 37, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>"8. In this part of this Schedule "standard of facilities" means the inclusion with the house of a garden, the provision of central heating or any other facilities which is a reasonably standard feature of accommodation certified in terms of sub-paragraphs 1 (a) above or is a facility of the house in respect of which the landlord is seeking an order for possession."</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that I was halfway through speaking, and the honourable Member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram) had asked me to give my own interpretation of paragraph 3(1)(b) of part III of the schedule. The phrase which the honourable
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 716</span>
Gentleman found particularly interesting was "extent and character". I referred the honourable Gentleman to the notes on clauses, which on this point state
<br><blockquote><p>"It must be reasonably suitable to the tenant's means and his family's needs as regards size and character of the accommodation."</p></blockquote>
His suspicion on this, so far as I interpret it, is not well founded. This would not necessarily mean that the tenant would move downmarket. It would mean that the accommodation would have to be reasonably suitable, taking those factors into account.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Adam Ingram <span class='memberconstituency'>(East Kilbride)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain the other part of clause 3(1)(b), which speaks of "means of the tenant"? Can he be more precise as to that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The notes on clauses refer to "his family's needs" and also to his means. The tenant's means are taken into account in the assessment for housing benefit and other matters of that nature. The problem which the honourable Gentleman fears is not likely to occur.<br><br>
I will deal quickly with amendments Nos. 348,349 and 350. The items which they seek to specify as having to be taken into account in determining suitability are an interesting selection, but again this is a matter which should be left to the sheriff's discretion. The danger in listing certain features is always that others are excluded. Finally, amendment No. 394 seeks to ensure that when a local authority provides suitable alternative accommodation it will be a secure tenancy. It is, of course, the case that all tenancies for which a local authority is landlord are secure tenancies, except in very limited circumstances which could not apply in the kind of case we are discussing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am less than satisfied with the answer that I received before the break and with that which I have just received. My earlier assertion stands—that the intention of the clause is to give powers to the landlord to move tenants downmarket. I listened carefully to the Minister. If I may paraphrase, he said that he did not think that that would be the intention. If he is prepared to give a guaranteed statement that that is not the intention, and that the clause will not be applied in that way, we shall be willing to withdraw the amendment. He has not given us those assurances. He is still reading the notes on clauses, so he may be able to give me a better definition than he has so far.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The notes on clauses were not drafted with this question in mind, but they give a reasonably objective picture of the position. They say:
<br><blockquote><p>"It provides that alternative accommodation must be reasonably suitable for the tenant and his family as regards proximity to place of work. It also provides that the accommodation must meet one of two other conditions."</p></blockquote>
They then state the conditions. It would be a matter of fact and would turn on the evidence whether those conditions had been applied. It is perfectly reasonable for the sheriff court to take that into consideration when it considers cases of this nature.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A whole range of value judgments can be placed upon paragraph 3(1)(b). I dwell again on the point about the means of the tenant. If it is determined that a tenant does not justify a larger house or better
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0473">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 717</span>
accommodation, the Secretary of State on Second Reading, speaking of tenants living in too luxurious accommodation, have created the worry and fear in our minds. Which are the reason for the amendment. The notes on clauses, albeit helpful, do not become law. That is why I seek clarification from the Minister on what he see as as the meaning. If he gives us proper explanations on that, I repeat that we shall be prepared to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One has to read the subsection in its entirety. It mentions not just the means but also the needs of the tenant. If the tenant has a large young family, all the facts and circumstances would have to be taken fully and properly into account, together with the size and character of the accommodation which has offered instead of the original accommodation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, I shall have to press the amendment to a Division.</span></p>

<p><i>Amendments made:</i> No. 201, in page 59, line 12, leave out 'court' and insert 'sheriff.</p>
<p>No. 202, in page 60, line 10, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"8A. Where paragraphs 8(1) above has effect in relation to a notice given as mentioned in Ground 2 in Part 1 of this Schedule, the reference in paragraph (b) of that ground to the landlord's interest in the tenancy is a reference to such an interest in the earlier tenancy and in any later tenancy falling within paragraph 8(2) above.".—<i>[Lord James Douglas-Hamilton]</i></p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><i>Question put.</i> That the schedule, as amended, be the Fifth Schedule to the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson <span class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had some interesting debates on the provisions of schedule 5, which established mandatory grounds for eviction of families and individuals in Scotland with a further range of grounds where the sheriff will have some discretion. The schedule is lying in tatters as a result of what the Minister said in the course of our last two sittings. He said that he would make a wide range of amendments to the schedule, and rightly so. The schedule should never have seen the light of day. It is a disgrace. We welcome the fact that the Government say, in effect, that they will take it away and start all over again. Nevertheless, it would be wrong for the Committee simply to endorse a schedule of this nature unamended. It has not been amended in any substantive way so far, and it will make it a great deal easier for landlords in the future to exploit the ill-named assured tenancy system in order to cause alarm and despondency among tenants in Scotland.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 718</span>
This is an alarming new departure in the field of let accommodation in Scotland. It will make it far too easy for unreasonable landlords to harass their tenants, whatever window-dressing there may be later in the Bill. For those reasons, we hope that the Committee will take this opportunity to take this wretched schedule out of the Bill and give the Government an opportunity to come back on Report with something that makes sense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting that the honourable Gentleman should make such a speech now, considering that only a few hours ago he moved an additional ground to the schedule and when all the way through the schedule he expressed doubts about certain aspects on behalf of Age Concern. I realise that he wants to make up for that now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister knows that what he has just said is not true. I was simply affording courtesy to the absent honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood), who tabled the amendment on behalf of Age Concern Scotland. I did not commend the amendment to the Committee. On the contrary, I simply said that I was putting it forward for debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman is nobly trying to recover his position.<br><br>
In the original 1984 Act there were 21 grounds. They have been reduced in the Bill to 17. I was surprised to hear the honourable Gentleman suggest an 18th ground. In any case, there are 16 grounds for the public sector under the 1987 Act.<br><br>
We have rightly discussed each of the grounds in the schedule thoroughly. I think that all members of the Committee agree that there are some circumstances in which a landlord should be able to regain possession of his house, even though the tenant does not wish to leave. I have undertaken to consider carefully whether we have the balance in schedule 5 exactly right between those grounds which would entitle a landlord to possession and those which simply make it possible. On that understanding, I hope that the Opposition will agree to the schedule.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No,</span></p>

<p>4.43 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
<p>5.3 p.m.</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 20 describes the powers of the court in instances where a landlord is seeking to take possession of a house let on an assured tenancy. The amendment is to clause 20(5)(a), which provides that:
<br><blockquote><p>any person having rights of occupation under the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981 … so long as he or she remains in occupation, shall have the same rights in relation to, or in connection with, any"</p></blockquote>
adjournment, suspension or postponement of proceedings in relation to repossession of the property, as he or she would have had had he or she been the original tenant.<br><br>
The reason for the amendment is to express concern that although it may be implicit in the terms of the Bill as they stand, it is not clear that the clause also applies to cohabitees who are given occupancy rights under the Act. As I understand the 1981 Act, it is clear that there is no distinction between spouses and cohabitees. The amendment is therefore suggested in the interests of clarity and certainty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On this occasion knowing that the amendment came from the Law Society of Scotland, it seems reasonable to advise my honourable Friends to support the honourable Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart)—though not to make a habit of it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the relevant case made by my honourable Friend the Member for Eastwood, but I am convinced that the doubts he expressed as to whether cohabitees would be covered are unfounded. The provision as drafted clearly refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"any person having rights of occupation under the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981".</p></blockquote>
That seems to me to ensure that cohabitees would be covered as fully as spouses. On the basis of that explanation I hope that my honourable Friend will seek leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) for his unprecedented support, but I am happy to accept the unequivocal advice of my honourable Friend the Minister. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move admendment No. 420, in page 14, line 2, leave out from 'on' to end of line 3 and add
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 720</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"grounds 2, 4, 5 and 6 of Part I of Schedule 5 to this Act.".</p></blockquote>
We were trying to support the honourable Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) on the last amendment. I was hoping that he would reciprocate on amendment No. 420, but I have my doubts.<br><br>
Clause 20 deals with the extended discretion of court in possession claims—a limited discretion, I fear—but the purpose of the amendment is to allow the court to adjourn possession proceedings where the grounds for possession are that suitable alternative accommodation is available, that the house is subject to a heritable security granted before creating the tenancy, that the tenant has given notice to quit that has expired, that the landlord wishes to demolish or reconstruct the house or carry out substantial work, or finally where there are rent arrears outstanding or, notwithstanding that there may be a clear rent account, payments have been late in the past. The amendment would not allow to adjourn possession proceedings on any of the other grounds in part I of schedule 5.<br><br>
Under the present Rent Act I understand that the sheriff has powers to adjourn cases, to sist or suspend execution of the order or to postpone the date of possession on the grounds where the amendment proposes that he should continue to have such discretion. The sole exemption is ground 8 of schedule 5 a new ground for possession, not contained in current private sector housing legislation, namely that the landlord wishes to demolish or reconstruct the house or to carry out substantial work. As the Minister knows, we have already argued at some length about the mandatory grounds covered in schedule 5. We see no inconsistency in allowing the sheriff to adjourn proceedings, to sit or suspend execution of the order or to postpone the date of possession on grounds where the court is obliged to order possession.<br><br>
The amendment has been proposed by Shelter (Scotland). We accept that on grounds 2, 4, 5 and 6 of schedule 5 the owner will probably require vacant possession of his property at an early date and tenants should have been aware from the start of the tenancy that their tenancy was most likely to be time limited, with the landlord guaranteed repossession. On the remaining grounds in part I of schedule 5, however, the tenant cannot foresee the landlord seeking and fulfilling the conditions for being granted a possession order when he takes up the offer of a tenancy. For example, where a tenancy has been let for not more than eight months and has previously been used as a holiday home—ground 4—the tenant has advance warning of when he will have to leave the property. The tenant has no such advance warning of when a landlord is likely to default on a loan—that is ground 3. It therefore seems reasonable that on the grounds where a tenant has no long-term knowledge of the likelihood of losing his home and having to seek alternative accommodation, the sheriff should have the power to postpone the date when the tenant will have to vacate by exercising powers under clause 20.<br><br>
Should grounds 1, 3, 7, 10 or 11 of part I of schedule 5 remain mandatory grounds for possession it is of increased importance that the sheriff has discretion to adjourn proceedings, to sist or suspend execution of the order or to postpone the date of possession to allow, where appropriate, the tenant to have time to look for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0475">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 721</span>
alternative accommodation. It is also suggested that the sheriff should be allowed to exercise discretion in relation to grounds 8 and 9, where again the tenant has no way of knowing that he may lose his home.<br><br>
It is clearly understood that if the amendment were accepted, the sheriff would have no power under clause 20(4) to recall a possession order on a mandatory ground for repossession.<br><br>
This is a complicated aspect aspect of the legislation, but the underlying point is simple: where a tenant has no way of foreseeing the trap that he is entering by accepting this kind of tenancy, a sheriff should be able to take account of the circumstances of the case and to delay action being taken on a repossession order in order to give a tenant time to find alternative accommodation. As things stand, it will be far too easy for a landlord to obtain a repossession order and for a tenant and his family to find themselves out on the street with insufficient time to find alternative accommodation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Doran <span class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In supporting my honourable Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) I wish to make two points. First, the clause more or less mirrors the provisions of section 12 of the 1984 Act, with one important exception—the exemption that is made to all cases falling within part I of schedule 5 to the Bill. In that small respect it considerably weakens the impact of the sheriff's discretion.<br><br>
I have practical experience of the operation of section 12. The provision can be used constructively by the courts on many occasions. It is wrong to assume that because a landlord and tenant end up in court it is inevitably the case that the landlord wants the tenant out so as to bring the tenancy to an end. In many cases the subject of dispute can be resolved. It also allows the parties time to go away and think. If two parties are at loggerheads in thinking that theirs is the only correct view, the objective mind that the sheriff brings to the consideration of the problem will sometimes allow both parties to see more clearly round the problem.<br><br>
In the case of the provisions that full under the terms of part I of schedule 5, the sheriff will not have that discretion. There will not be that constructive element—the arbitration of disputes—if the amendment is not accepted, and would be a sad loss. Labour Ministers have made the point repeatedly that this measure will considerably dilute the rights of tenants in Scotland. We should, however, feel a wee bit happier—although not a great deal—if some discretion were left to the sheriff in these difficult cases. It is wrong that the whole motivation of the Bill should be the simple removal of rights from tenants and the opening up of all sorts of opportunities for unscrupulous landlords. It is wrong for the Government to legislate as they are doing, making this dramatic shift away from the protections afforded by the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 and previous Acts to the virtually total removal of rights.<br><br>

Why do the Government not trust the courts? Why do they not trust the sheriff to adjudicate in these cases? No evidence has been presented to the Committee or to any other body, so far as I am aware, to suggest that sheriffs have not exercised their jurisdiction properly and have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 722</span>
not considered cases in the spirit in which the legislation was intended to operate. I support my honourable Friend the Member for East Lothian.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would extend the grounds for possession which, when invoked, would allow the sheriff to exercise discretion to adjourn the proceedings or delay execution of the order. The honourable Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) asked why the sheriff's discretion should be limited. In the previous Acts there have been mandatory grounds. In the 1984 Act there were 10 mandatory grounds and at least seven in the 1987 Act which relates to public authorities. This is not a new precedent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, but this relates to entirely different circumstances. All the provisions in part I of the Bill that we are considering are fundamental. Most of them are grounds where previously the sheriff had discretion, but that discretion has been removed. I accept that in cases under schedule 2 to the 1984 Act there was no discretion for the sheriff as section 12 (5) limited it. But we are talking about completely different circumstances such as rent arrears where the sheriff previously had discretion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it has not occurred to the honourable Member that the purpose of part II of the Bill is to bring back into use a large proportion of the vacant houses in Scotland. We believe that having mandatory as well as discretionary grounds will ensure that that will happen. The question is to get the balance right.<br><br>
We discussed the issue of the sheriff's discretion generally along with amendment No. 258 to clause 18. At that time I explained that the Government think it right that when a landlord has a mandatory right to repossess, that right should not be able to be reduced by a sheriff exercising his discretion to adjourn proceedings. However, as honourable Members will remember, I have already said that I intend to introduce an element of discretion on grounds 1 and 11. That would automatically mean that under clause 20 the sheriff would be able to exercise his discretion, in particular to adjourn or postpone proceedings relating to those grounds.<br><br>
As for the remaining mandatory grounds, I do not accept that the tenant could not be expected to know that he might face proceedings. In the case of grounds 7 and 10, a tenant will have brought the proceedings for possession himself. In any case, as I have already explained, when a landlord has a mandatory right it is wrong for him not to be able to regain possession swiftly. I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was a fairly predictable knock back from the Minister. I cannot see the point of having a clause of this nature, merely giving a sheriff discretion in the timing and manner of dealing with landlords seeking to dispossess their tenants. I am less than satisfied with that response from the Minister.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is worth drawing attention to subsection (6), which provides:
<br><blockquote><p>"This section does not apply if the sheriff is satisfied that the landlord is entitled to possession of the house on any of the grounds in Part I of the Schedule 5 to this Act."</p></blockquote>
In other words, it is not worth the paper it is printed on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The notes on clauses make it clear that subsection (6) excludes from the scope of the clause possession proceedings brought under the mandatory grounds in schedule 5.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause allows the sheriff to adjourn the proceedings for possession or to suspend execution of any possession order in certain circumstances.

Clause 22</div> <!-- clause -->
<p>Payment of removal expenses in certain cases</p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This clause is all about the payment of flitting expenses in certain cases.<br><br>
I wish to make two points. The first could have been covered by the non-existent amendment No. 442, which was to have been moved by the non-existent honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr Kirkwood). That would have given a tenant the right to appoint a representative to negotiate terms with the landlord to cover the cost of flitting.<br><br>
Secondly, I was interested to see that subsection (1) ends with the words
<br><blockquote><p>"the landlord shall pay to the tenant a sum equal to the reasonable expenses likely to be incurred by the tenant in removing from the house."</p></blockquote>
That could be taken to mean that the landlord will be required to pay only for physically removing and ejecting the tenant and his property out of the door. I hope that it also covers the expense of moving to and into the alternative accommodation. I presume that that is what it means, but I should like that assurance on the record.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I explain what the clause does, I am confident that the honourable Gentleman will welcome it. It gives a right to a tenant who loses his accommodation under grounds 1 or 8 to compensation from his landlord for his expenses of removing from his house. The expenses to which such a tenant is entitled are not simply those involved in getting out of the house which he is leaving, but would also cover reasonable costs associated with setting up house elsewhere.<br><br>
The honourable Gentleman on amendment No. 442,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 724</span>
which was not moved. Perhaps I could make one point on that. If the tenant is moved to other accommodation before compensation has been agreed, the task of agreeing his reasonable costs would in any case fall to his personal representatives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To be absolutely clear, the term "removing from the hose" includes moving into the next house.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that must be right.</span></p>

Clause 23</div> <!-- clause -->
<p>Limited prohibition on assignation etc. without consent</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 408, in page 14, line 39, leave out 'of the landlord' and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"in writing of the landlord, which shall not be unreasonbly withheld."</p></blockquote>
The clause prevents tenants with assured tenancies from assigning and sub-letting the tenancy without the landlord's consent except in certain circumstances—for instance, when a tenancy agreement includes an express provision either prohibiting or permitting such assignation. The amendment would go one step further and restore the current position under the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987. Under the Act secure tenants, including housing association tenants, are entitled to sublet or assign their tenancy so long as they receive written consent from their landlord, and that consent must not be unreasonably withheld by the landlord. The amemdment seeks to ensure that those rights and duties are preserved in the Bill.<br><br>
The Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, which suggested the amendment, believes that it is fair to both the landlord and the tenant that, where the consent is required, it should be given in writing; that requirement would not adversely affect any incentive for an individual or a group of individuals to become involved in the provision of rented housing, which we assume is the Government's motive for the Bill.<br><br>
This is a reasonable amendment, which asks that the current position under the 1987 Act be restored. It would not prejudice the attraction of private investment into the private rented sectors. I ask the Minister to concede this reasonable amentment suggested by the SFHA.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman has explained his amendment clearly, but I regret that I cannot agree that assignation of the tenancy or sub-letting a house let on a tenancy could not seriously affect a landlord's interests, as a sub-tenant will have assured tenancy rights. If a tenancy is assigned, the landlord might be unable to regain possession of his house almost indefinitely.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0477">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 725</span>
The amendment addresses two points—first, whether the landlord's consent to assignation or sub-letting should have to be in writing and, secondly, whether the landlord should be forbidden to withhold his consent to assignation unreasonably. As regards the former, it is not necessary to require the landlord's consent to be in writing—a provable oral agreement should suffice. On the second issue, I am aware that the honourable Gentleman is trying to tip the balance away from the landlord, but I do not accept that the amendment is necessary. It should be up to the landlord to decide whether assignation or sub-letting affecting his property should take place. In any case, I find it difficult to see how anyone could assess whether a landlord's refusal to allow assignation or sub-letting was unreasonable. I hope the he honourable Gentleman will accept that the amendment should not be pursued.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly will not accept that. I think that the Minister has been most unfair. Not all landlords are likely to be as reasonable as the Minister. It is stretching the Committee's credulity too far to expect it to believe that one can trust a gentleman's agreement with one's landlord and that oral agreement is sufficient. Tenants faced with the weakening of security of tenure will be anxious to retain the current position under the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 that written consent should be given if such an agreement is reached. At the end of the day, it is aquestion of whether the landlord decides to give that consent, but the consent should be written. It is not unreasonable for the Opposition to suggest that that consent should be withheld only where it is reasonable so to do. Any tenant who felt that it was unreasonable to withhold it could apply to the sheriff court, which probably happens under the present legislation.<br><br>
5.30 pm<br><br>
The Minister is asking too much in expecting tenants to accept the landlord's word. A minority of landlords are unscrupulous and their word cannot be taken as being honest or reliable. The Minister is exposing tenants with such landlords to abuse. I ask him to think again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is the third area in which the Minister has refused to concede that something should be in writing. The most important previous area was the question of leases. As one with some experience of the courts and of the kinds of disputes that occur in such cases, I am concerned that we are creating a minefield of litigation and points of dispute to the detriment of both landlords and tenants. We are creating uncertainty. There is no requirement to be certain anywhere in the Bill except in relation to sheriffs' discretion about landlords who want to remove their tenants. I ask the Minister to think about the whole issue of allowing these fundamental and basic legal contracts to exist without any written evidence. It runs right through the Minister's responses. There is a limit to how far one can unshackle the landlord, even looking at it from the point of view of the Government's philosophy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that there is a genuine difference of opinion on this matter, which deals with a limited prohibition on assignation without consent. I am afraid that I cannot add to what I have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 726</span>
already said, which is that the terms of the Bill should stand in the form in which they are written.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept the Minister's reply and I will not withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths <span class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 422, in page 14, line 42, leave out "or any part".<br><br>
I think that this is an amendment that the Minister will be able to accept. It is a reasonable amendment. It has been accepted that with an assured tenancy a tenant should neither assign the tenancy nor sublet the whole of it, but it seems unduly restrictive to prevent a tenant from sub-letting any part of it. The restriction does not apply to current regulated tenancies, nor would the removal of the words "or any part" deny the landlord the right to insert provisions that would allow him to insert in a tenancy agreement clauses that prohibited either sub-letting or setting out clear conditions for any sub-letting.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will respond by accepting the deletion of "or any part".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 23 is necessary as a protection for both landlord and tenant. Because clause 27 in effect provides that a sub-tenant who holds from an assured tenant is himself entitled to the protections of assured tenancy, it is necessary to provide in clause 23 that there should be a statutory condition prohibiting assignation or sub-letting without the landlord's consent. If this were not so, the landlord would be faced with the creation of perhaps a large number of assured tenancies over which he or she had no control and all of which he or she would have to bring to an end before being able to get repossession. However, subsection (2) allows the landlord and tenant, if they so wish, to come to some different arrangement, which may well give the tenant greater rights than does the statutory commitment.<br><br>
That protection is essential in both the landlord's and the tenant's interest, so I cannot accept the amendment. It makes not the slightest difference to this principle whether it is the whole of the house that is sub-let or only a part of it. The landlord must not be faced with a substructure of tenancies to which he was not a party.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must surely accept that the way in which the amendment is framed and the arguments behind it would allow the landlord to insert an appropriate clause in the conditions of tenancy that would safeguard his or her interests and at the same time woud not unduly tie a tenant at the outset, as the clause would do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the honourable Gentleman's point, but if there were no statutory control the landlord could find that a whole chain of assured tenancies could be granted to subtenants with whom he or she had never had dealings. It does not matter whether only part of the house is involved. The principle is exactly the same.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The principle behind the Bill is to ensure that the 100,000-odd empty properties in the private
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0478">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 727</span>
sector are let. If those are indeed to be let—some of us are sceptical about that and feel that the Bill will have minimal impact—it is important for the Minister to concede that there is no point in having units that are of an unattractive size to a tenant. By accepting the amendment we believe that the tenant could parcel up the units, with the consent of the landlord, in such a way as to ensure that the whole of the property was occupied, and therefore that rooms were not unoccupied, and to make sure that the larger properties, of which there are many in my constituency, were let. I rebut the Minister's implication that there is a lack of control over how that is done. The important thing is that the "any part" part of it is too restrictive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I said earlier, subsection (2) enables the landlord and the tenant to come to an agreement if they so wish, but that must depend on their wishes. There is no bar to their reaching an agreement in the various circumstances that the honourable Gentleman might envisage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed.</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that there was some confusion in the ranks over amendment No. 422, so I shall say what I wanted to say now. I am at a loss to understand the purpose or subsection (2). Subsection (1) imports an implied term into a lease prohibiting assignations and so on. Then subsection (2) states that that shall not apply if it is already provided for in the agreement. That is totally superfluous and meaningless—the sort of gobbledegook that one finds in modern legislation. I should like the Minister to explain the need for virtual repetition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The notes on clauses state clearly that subsection (2)
<br><blockquote><p>"provides that subsection (1) does not apply if the tenancy agreement includes an express provision, either prohibiting or permitting assignation, sub-letting or parting with possession."</p></blockquote>
Basically that means that the parties are free to come to whatever agreement they wish. That is clearly in the interests of both tenant and landlord.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I read clause 23(1), that is exactly what that does. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"it shall be an implied term…except with the consent of the landlord".</p></blockquote>
I just cannot see why the provision is there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the provision makes the position absolutely clear. I shall look at it, but I am pretty certain that that is so.<br><br>
Perhaps it will help the honourable Gentleman if I spell out what the clause as a whole does. It embodies a principle which I hope that all members of the Committee, including the honourable Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran), will find unexceptionable—the principle that the landlord should have the right to say whether he does or does not wish his
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 728</span>
tenant to assign the tenancy or sub-let the house to another person. In many cases the landlord will, of course, be content to allow an assignation or sub-letting, and the clause provides alternative ways for granting the necessary permission. The landlord may give unrestricted permission for assignation or sub-letting within the terms of the tenancy agreement. Alternatively, he may give permission as and when an assignation or sub-letting is proposed.<br><br>
The subsection to which the honourable Gentleman refers is merely there for clarification.</span></p>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
INCREASES OF RENT UNDER ASSURED TENANCIES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 409, in page 15, line 2, leave out 'may' and insert 'shall'.<br><br>
The intention is to place an onus on the landlord to serve on the tenant such a notice as is described in the clause. The purpose of the amendment is to clarify whether all tenants have the right to refer notices proposing a new rent to a rent assessment committee, or whether the right applies only where there is no mechanism within the contractual agreement for increasing the rent. Clarification is necessary to ascertain whether all tenants have the right to refer notices proposing increases to a rent assessment committee, or whether this right, and the right to have a notice proposing a new rent served, applies only where there is no mechanism for increasing the rent within the contractual agreement.<br><br>
Should the Government's intention be the latter, the question for tenants is the absence of any mechanism for arbitration of contractual terms, which may be weighted in favour of the landlord, and which may be so unfair and burdensome to the tenant that he is unable to meet his contractual obligations, particularly on rent increases. We have all come across cases in which the tenant, in his desire to obtain a property, is prepared to negotiate an agreement with the landlord. That is particularly true where housing benefit will effectively pay the rent. The Minister will be aware, however, that under the new housing benefit regulations levels of rent struck by agreement between the landlord and the tenant will not automatically be accepted for payment of benefit. If tenants have accepted the terms of the contract, agreed to unreasonable rent increases and, as a result, have no right to refer their rent increases to a rent assessment committee for arbitration, there are serious implications for their ability to pay.<br><br>
I am speaking from a brief prepared by Shelter because this is a complex matter and I want to make absolutely clear the main thrust of the argument. The proposed new changes to the housing benefit scheme as a result of the deregulation of the private rented sector will mean that, where a tenant makes application for housing benefit, the local authority must refer the rent payable directly to the rent officer. Where he considers it unreasonably high, he will do a valuation and, where he considers a lower rent would be more reasonable, he will notify the local authority of the figure that he has assessed. Local
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0479">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 729</span>
authorities will be extremely reluctant to pay out, if they are even able to alter the regulations, housing benefit for a rent higher than that assessed by the rent officer because it is the Government's intention to restrict the level of subsidy paid for housing benefit purposes to the rent level assessed by the rent officer.<br><br>
5.45 p.m.<br><br>
Tenants may have to apply for housing benefit because of a change of circumstances. For example, someone who is earning a reasonable income and is able to afford a rent that he has agreed with the landlord may find himself unemployed, or a housing benefit claimant may have negotiated a rent in the belief that it will be met by the local authority and suddenly find that, because of the new assessment for housing benefit purposes, he simply cannot afford it. The amendment would give such tenants the opportunity to apply immediately to the rent assessment committee in the hope of having the rent reassessed at the same level as that assessed for benefit purposes by the rent officer.<br><br>
The Minister will gather that this is a probing amendment. I want to hear what he has to say about the Government's position on this.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought when I first read the honourable Gentleman's amendment that that was his purpose, but on reading it more closely I do not think that the amendment would achieve that. It is based on the mistaken assumption that, as clause 24 is drafted, a landlord will be able to increase the rent at the end of a contractual assured tenancy or during a statutory assured tenancy without serving the tenant first with a notice of the proposed increase.<br><br>
In fact, the clause means that the landlord will have to issue a clause 24 notice if he proposes to increase the rent. The use of the word "may" is simply to indicate that the landlord would not seek to increase the rent in the circumstances described by clause 24. The amendment might have the unfortunate—and, I am sure, unintended—effect of requiring him to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that the landlord has the option to increase the rent and that the clause as drafted would require the landlord to serve a clause 24 notice only if he decided to increase the rent?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the interpretation of the clause as a whole. It means that the landlord has the option as to whether to issue a clause 24 notice, were he to propose to increase the rent. That is the purpose of the clause. Subsection (1) reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"For the purpose of securing an increase in the rent under an assured tenancy, the landlord may serve on the tenant a notice in the prescribed form</p></blockquote>
"proposing a new rent to take effect—
<ol>
<li>if the tenancy was a contractual tenancy…; or</li>
<li>if the tenancy was not such a contractual tenancy,"</li></ol>
and subsection (3) explains that:
<br><blockquote><p>"Where a notice is served under subsection (1) above, a new rent specified in the notice shall take effect as mentioned in the notice, unless, before the beginning of the period to which the new rent relates".</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 730</span>
Basically the amendment which the honourable Gentleman has tabled with the best intentions would not have the result that he seeks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I see the Minister's point but, as I read the clause, the words
<br><blockquote><p>"For the purpose of securing an increase in the rent"</p></blockquote>
would give the landlord the discretion. Clause 24 would come into play only if the landlord decided that he wanted an increase in the rent. Thereafter he must go through the process of serving a notice on the tenant. The discretion is in the first line, but nowhere does it appear that it is mandatory that he should serve a notice under the clause, the word "may" appears, in my simple eyes, to give the landlord a discretion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not mandatory, but it is also not mandatory that the landlord should put up the rent. That is the danger of the honourable Gentleman's amendment, to put pressure on landlords to put up the rent, which I am sure was not his purpose in this connection.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has missed the point. The point I am making is that, as I read the clause, the discretion is in the first line. The notice will be served only
<br><blockquote><p>"For the purpose of securing an increase in the rent".</p></blockquote>
It is only for that purpose that the notice will be served. It goes on:
<br><blockquote><p>"the landlord may serve on the tenant".</p></blockquote>
As I read that, it gives a landlord an opportunity to decide that he will increase the rent, and he may thereafter serve a notice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was once asked if I would become a parly draftsman, but I said no on that occasion. I will look closely again at the drafting. I will go through it word for word. I think that the answer that I have given the honourable Gentleman will stand the test of time, but I will make certain.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Nicholas Fairbiarn <span class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and Kinross)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is force in what the honourable Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) said. A court would be perfectly entitled to say that if
<br><blockquote><p>"For the purpose of securing an increase in the rent under an assured tenancy, the landlord may serve on the tenant a notice",</p></blockquote>
the implication of "may" is "or may not". I see no difficulty in saying that if he wants to increase the rent he must serve a notice. I do not know whether my honourable Friend was tempted not to become a partly draftsman because his mind is so clear and his language so explicit, but it is not difficult to write a sentence which means that one is not allowed even to suggest increasing the rent until one tells the tenant that one is going to try to do so. That is presumably what the provision is meant to mean. As it stands, it is ambiguous and I ask the Minister to look at it again. If one says to somebody, "Come to dinner", and he says, "I may", that implies that also that he may not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree to reconsider the drafting of this point. I accept what my honourable and learned Friend has said. The position must be

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Normally I am bound to Her Majesty's counsel's learned advice, but in this case I am content to wait until the Minister has reflected on the points that I have made. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 411, in clause 25, page 16, line 5, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>(3A) Where the interest of the landlord belongs to a registered housing association, the Committee shall determine a rent which it considers to be reasonable having regard to the conditions laid down in section 24(5) above.'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose is plain enough. It is to establish a system by which rents payable by assured tenants of registered housing associations can be determined. I could go into a great deal of detail on this point, but the Minister can relax because I do not intend to do so.<br><br>
I refer the Minister back to some of his own remarks on Second Reading. He said that rents for housing association property should be reasonable and affordable. I draw his attention to the interesting document recently produced by the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, entitled "Who do we house?", the interim report 1987, "A survey of Tenants of Housing Associations in Scotland", which demonstrates that housing associations are providing housing for people who are on lower than average income and, to use the technical jargon, less economically active than the rest of the population of Scotland. Given that housing associations have the job of providing for the special needs of elderly or disabled people, or of deprived communities in area-renewal type developments, there is an overwhelming case for ensuring that the rents set for this type of property are genuinely affordable—to use the jargon bandied about over both this legislation and the parallel English legislation.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 732</span>
We understand that the Government's intention in the legislation is to make it far easier for landlords to shove up rents, and to take full advantage of the scarcity of housing and the premiums which can be attached in the free market for rented housing. The Minister well knows that the housing association movement does not want to be part of that drift towards market courses in rents, but wants to go on providing housing at fair and reasonable rents for the people in whom they are interested, whether special needs groups or neighbourhood groups. The case is straightforward enough. We should like to know a little more in this connection about the Government's plans for housing association finance and housing association grants—or HAG, as they are affectionately known. The consultation document which the Government put out on this subject is not unconnected with this legislation, but I do not want to be bogged down in details.<br><br>
The Minister has already spoken of his intention before Report to meet the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations to discuss other aspects of this legislation, and points which we have been dicussing earlier. Can he give an undertaking at this stage that rent fixing and rent levels for housing associations will also be on the agenda at that meeting, so that the housing association movement can understand exactly what the Government have in mind and can brief Members of this House and Members of the House of Lords in advance of further consideration of the Bill in this House and in the other place? We may well want to press admendments of this nature harder at that stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can reply at once to the honourable Gentleman that his point concerning rents has been part of the discussions which began before Christmas. In the discussions which will take place we shall deal with rights of future housing association tenants, the position of tenants who move within the stock of single housing association premises for good management reasons, and all aspects of the working of the new financial framework, including private finance, rents and the grant system.<br><br>
It may assist the Committee if I explain the Government's tactics and strategy in this connection. In one of our earlier debates on a group of amendments to schedule 4, I explained that there are two reasons for inroducing a new financial framework for housing associations. I will go briefly over those reasons again. The first reason is that housing associations have reached a stage in their development in which it is appropriate for them to have greater responsibility for and control over their own financial affairs. The second reason is to allow housing associations access to private finance, so that the level of activity achievable can be increased. They are interrelated, because housing associations in Scotland seeking private finance have been baulked by the absence of any ability to manage their own financial affairs. The private finance available, and thus the extra new houses made possible, has gone to English housing associations because they have had the necessary degree of control over their own rents and their finances in general, so Scotland has to some extent been losing out. Our aim is to change that by changing the financial framework for Scottish housing associations.<br><br>
6 p.m.<br><br>
I am pleased that the Scottish Federation of Housing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0481">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 733</span>
Associations shares the Government's aim. In relation to earlier amendments its briefing notes have stressed that it has had regard to the need not to continue to deprive housing associations of access to private finance. I acknowledge that it has put forward these two amendments in the belief that they would provide a structure for achieving the Government's aim, but I am afraid that it has overlooked the fact that its proposals would have side effects that are irreconcilable with the aim that it shares with the Government.<br><br>
I hope that Opposition Members concur with the SFHA in fully sharing the Government's resolution to give housing associations in Scotland the access to private finance that has already proved very beneficial to housing associations in England and which there is every reason to believe will become more widely beneficial in the future. As I said in an earlier debate, private finance is potentially beneficial in relation to every future housing association project, including those that continue to require particularly high levels of housing association grant. Every pound of private finance means that public expenditure resources will go further in terms of the overall housing association programme. Conversely, maintaining existing barriers to private finance will mean that people who could have new or improved housing association houses to live in will have a good deal longer to enjoy that benefit.<br><br>
The availability of private finance depends crucially on housing associations having control of their own financial affairs. No one could be expected to lend money to be spent on providing rented housing to a body that could not exercise control over its ability to repay the loan.<br><br>
Amendment No. 411 strikes directly at that vital consideration. It would put the rent assessment committee in the position where it could set a rent, against the housing association's own considered judgment, which was inadequate to cover the housing association's costs. That possibility would debar housing associations from access to private finance, in exactly the same way as the fact that rents are presently set by rent officers and, ultimately, the rent assessment committee, creates a barrier now.<br><br>
It is vital to be clear about this. The precondition of private finance is not any particular level of rents—it is whether the borrower controls its own financial affairs. That is particularly relevant to the medium and long term. Loans are commonly for periods of 30 years or more, and lenders are naturally interested in the ability of the housing association to make repayments over the whole of the period, not just in the first year. The existing role proposed in the Bill for the rent assessment committee, to ensure that rents are not forced above market levels, does not impinge on housing associations' control of their own affairs. It is unlikely to be of any practical relevance to registered housing associations, which are clearly unlikely to be seeking to increase rents beyond market levels. However, the general purpose of the provision, which applies to all assured tenancies, is to provide a safeguard against exploitation of a tenants' natural reluctance to move house where they have taken on a tenancy in the expectation that the house will be their home for as long as they wish.<br><br>
Turning to amendment No. 410 the objections that I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 734</span>
have just outlined also apply, notwithstanding that it proposes that the Secretary of State would be empowered to set maximum and minimum rents rather than a single rent as the rent assessment committee would. It is a much worse interference in housing associations' control of their financial affairs. There are two reasons for that. First, it would bring the Secretary of State into decisions about rent increases even in cases where there was no disagreement between the housing association and its tenants. Secondly, by requiring the Secretary of State to set a minimum rent, it could put housing associations that managed their financial affairs particularly well in the unreasonable position of being unable to pass on the benefits of their good management to their tenants.<br><br>
I have not sought to base my explanation of the drawbacks of amendment No. 410 on the fact that it would draw the Secretary of State into detailed decisions about every individual tenant and impose a substantial burden on the Scottish office. I know that the honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) would be impatient of such arguments. None the less, there are real considerations for those who have to bear practical responsibility for the administration. We are talking about many thousands of decisions ever year, each of which would need to receive full and proper consideration. That is an immense administrative burden, especially when one takes into account that the function proposed is to second guess housing associations in their view of rents.<br><br>
Having explained the problems with the amendments, I return to the important point that there is common ground between the Government and the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations. A crucial factor in determining rent levels must, as the honourable Member for East Lothian stressed, be their affordability by the persons for whom groups of houses are intended. Thus the income of the tenants must be a major factor in determining the rents that are set, both when houses are first let and when they are increased. It is for housing associations themselves to form a view of appropriate rent levels. They are closest to their tenants and have the best knowledge of their circumstances, as well as of the other important financial considerations that most affect rent decisions. Those other considerations will be influenced by the other factors contained in amendment No. 410. the financial position of the association will be influenced by the housing association grant and other subsidies that the association has received and by the nature of its stock. A housing association could not avoid taking those factors into account in making its proposals to tenants for increases in rents along with the absolutely vital factor not mentioned by the amendment—the exercise by the association of its financial and management responsibilities in a way designed to give tenants as good a service as it can at a cost that minimises pressure on rents.<br><br>
I have spoken at some length on the proposals because I believe that the welfare of the housing association movement is vital to the success of the Bill. It is fundamental to our proposals that we should move from a position in which housing associations and their tenants have no real say in what rents are charged to one in which decisions about rents rest primarily with housing associations, with as little interference as possible from outside. I hope that the honourable Member for East Lothian will find those remarks reassuring.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 735</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Had I known that I would provoke such a torrent of verbiage, I might have been less provocative in moving the amendment.<br><br>
We understand the Government's fetish about private finance in housing. What causes a lot of concern to us and to providers of housing, particularly housing associations, is the price that tenants are likely to have to pay for that private finance in the future. That is not yet adequately understood. If the Government let market forces rip in rented housing, there is little doubt that rents will rise to levels that a lot of people who depend on the provision of housing by housing associations cannot afford. That is intolerable. The Minister cheerfully said that the housing association movement was wildly enthusiastic about the prospect of getting its hands on private money. I have no doubt that the housing association movement will be keen to get its hands on any money it can, but one wonders whether the sort of people who voluntarily devote so much time and energy to running housing associations will be keen on being forced into a financial package requiring them to extract unaffordable or extortionate rents from elderly or disabled people, those from impoverished neighbourhoods, single parent families and other groups that housing associations have been set up to assist.<br><br>
We saw an uncharacteristic attempt by the Minister to put words into the mouths of housing associations in Scotland when he said that they were totally happy about the prospect of finding themselves in that financial framework. People in housing associations that I have been talking to are not in the least happy about being involved in shoving up rents to that extent. Indeed, I fear that this financial package could tear the heart out of the housing association movement in Scotland. Who will be prepared to put in a voluntary effort to impose extortionate rents on their neighbours and friends and those for whom they care?<br><br>
Having got that load off my chest, I invite the Minister to confirm, as I think he did earlier, that the question of writing into the Bill a mechanism for fixing rents in housing associations, which might vary from rents elsewhere because of all the circumstances that we have discussed, will be on the agenda at his meeting with representatives of the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations in two or three weeks' time. Will he confirm that an amendment may be tabled on Report? We insist that it should be tabled on Report so that this House will have an opportunity to consider it as well as the other place. There is probably a consensus on both sides of the Committee that there should be special provision for fixing rents in housing associations.<br><br>
It would have been better if this could have been thrashed out during the consultation process before the Bill was published. The Government rushed the Bill into print and the consultation is still staggering on. It is important that there should be a clearly understood framework that is seen to be fair and affordable so that housing associations can get on with their work. The point is fundamentally important. If the Minister can give an assurance that the subject will be on the agenda and that an amendment is likely to be tabled on Report, I might seek leave to withdraw the amendment. As the honourable Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) wants to take part in the debate, I shall not do so at this stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is important that housing
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 736</span>
associations should have more effective access to private finance. Most people would agree with the second theme that runs through the Minister's argument—the need to ensure that, as far as is possible, individual decisions affecting individual housing associations are made by them. That is a sensible direction in which to move. I can see also that the Government are bound to be cautious about being constrained by a framework set down in primary legislation that is difficult to change if any wording appears unsuitable in future. However, there is a problem about terms such as "affordable" and "reasonable", which may not be subject to improvement by legislation. I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about that.<br><br>
Clearly, we are not talking about market rents. The honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) used words like "extortion". The Minister said that he was sure that housing associations would not charge rents higher than market rents. I am not sure how anyone can charge rents higher than market rents without having a great deal of empty property on their hands in due course.<br><br>
The main point that I want to make to the Minister is not necessarily that he should make a legislative amendment, because there are difficulties with that, but I hope that the Government will recognise that there is a danger that housing association tenants may have wholly unjustified but none the less real misapprehensions and fears about their rent levels. I hope that if the Minister is unable to change the provisions in the Bill, he will give serious thought to how best to ensure, after the Bill is enacted, that the real position of housing association tenants can be communicated to them, perhaps by reference to what has happened in England in the cases to which he referred. Clearly there is a danger that much fear and misapprehension will be generated because, to put it simply, what one person thinks is affordable and reasonable might not be what someone else thinks is affordable and reasonable.</span></p>
<p>6.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would like to take up some of the points that the Minister made about finances, especially in relation to his comments on the need for private finance. It is hardly surprising that the Minister is riddled with guilt about the funding of housing associations, because under the Government, the budgets of housing associations have been savaged. If we look at the Government's record on Housing Corporation funding and compare it with the record of the last Labour Government, we see that between 1974 and 1979 Housing Corporation budgets increased fivefold. Under the Conservatives the budget fell for three successive years, 1983, 1984 and 1985. In fact, the Housing Corporation will spend less in the next financial year than in 1982–83—six years ago. Funding has gone up by only 59 per cent. in real terms since 1979, compared with a fivefold increase under the Labour Government.<br><br>
It is hardly surprising that the Minister wants to suck in some private capital to make up for the public money which he refused to commit to it in the way that the Labour Government did. It is inconceivable that private sector finance will come in to make up the deficiencies of the Government. The Government's need to renew their commitment to the Housing Corporation and the housing association movement as the Labour
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0483">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 737</span>
Government did.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am filled with blank astonishment that the honourable Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) should have the nerve to make a speech of that nature. The Labour Government gave vitually nothing to housing associations. In the last few years the Government have given more than £600 million. In 1987–88 we have given £123 million to the Housing Corporation. For 1988–89 it will be £ 13 3 million. Yet the honourable Member has the nerve to say that housing associations are not receiving funding.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am simply quoting parliamentary answers given to my honourable Friends. The Minister cannot deny that they show that at 1987 prices spending on the Housing Corporation was increased by Labour from £16.3 million in 1973 to £83.8 million, a fivefold increase. Does he challenge that figure?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman is speaking about the Housing Corporation for Britain. The figure is different for the Housing Corporation in Scotland. The figures that I have been quoting relate to the Housing Corporation in Scotland. I should like to examine the figures, because I suspect that the honourable Gentleman is quoting the British figures, which give a totally different picture from the Scottish figures. The Scottish figures have, quite rightly, leapt out of all proportion. The Government's commitment to the housing association movement is very strong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These are the Scottish figures. I want that put on the record.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to see them, because the housing association movement in Scotland has had funding of more than £600 million over the last few years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my honourable Friend. I was similarly taken aback by what the honourable Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) said. It is my recollection that the allocation to housing associations in 1979 when the Conservative Government came into office was of the order of £36 million. Clearly, if one has a very small base, one can increase the multiple without spending a great deal more public money. My recollection is that in 1979 it was about £36 million. That figure is comparable to the £123 million to which my honourable Friend referred—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It sounds to me as if the figures that the honourable Member for Edinburgh, South has bandied about do not square with the recognised, established figures. I shall go into the matter thoroughly, but I give him the clearest possible assurance that spending on the Housing Corporation from public funding has increased enormously in recent years, much more than under the Labour Government. I shall get the facts and the honourable Gentleman may be sure that they will be raised later in the Committee.<br><br>
The honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) asked a number of questions. As he said, we must be cautious about writing a mechanism into the Bill,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 738</span>
but I assure him that discussions will take place on the items that I mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does that mean that there is a possibility or a likelihood of an amendment being introduced on Report on this important point?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that an amendment is necessary. I hope that we can get agreement in our discussions, which we shall pursue thoroughly.<br><br>
The honourable Member for East Lothian referred to letting market forces rip. As I have said in the past, housing associations will not have to charge a market rent; they will be subsidised. HAG will continue to be a means of keeping rents below market levels. I could speak at great length on this subject. Indeed, I think I have already done so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On this occasion I think that the Minister has said just about enough, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> that the clause as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 24 provides for increases of rent under assured tenancies. That is one of the glaring principles in the Bill—that rents should be able to increase throughout Scotland and that landlords will find it easier to achieve such increases.<br><br>
I want to put on the record the kind of people who are abroad in Scotland and likely to take advantage of these provisions. I have in my hand a letter dated 18 November 1987, addressed to a young couple in my constituency from a firm of solicitors in Edinburgh's town area on behalf of their landlord. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Dear Sir,</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Notice of Increase in Rent</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Notice of Nuisance in Contravention of Lease</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>We act on behalf of"</p></blockquote>
and there follows the name of the landlord.
<br><blockquote><p>"In view of the fact that you have now occupied the subjects in excess of one year it is now felt that it is time for a rent review and increase. Please note that the Landlords propose to increase your rent to £120 per month"—</p></blockquote>
it is worth mentioning that the rent had previously been £60 a month—
<br><blockquote><p>"said rent to commence on the first day of January 1988 and to run until the end of that year. There will be a further rent review at the end of that year.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Please also note that it is understood that you are also causing a nuisance".</p></blockquote>
The nuisance was in the form of the couple's car parked outside their house and the fact that they had a dog. The letter went on:
<br><blockquote><p>"You have one month from this date to get rid of both the subjects littering the area and the dog. If you fail to meet these conditions then the Landlords will have no option but to go to Court and have you evicted for breach of the tenancy agreement".</p></blockquote>
That happened in the land of Scotland this past winter. Those unfortunate people are in a substandard house with no written lease, and the lady was expecting a baby. Tenants have been abused in that way in the private sector which the Government are so keen to encourage. I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0484">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 739</span>
acknowledge that that is an extreme case, but I fear that we shall see many similar cases in the coming years, as the bill encourages irresponsible landlords of that type.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult for me to comment on a case without hearing the other point of view. My honourable and learned Friend the Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn), who has been Solicitor-General for Scotland, will confirm that one side of the case is put to one as a lawyer, but that when one appears in court, defending or pursuing the client's rights, one finds that a different picture emerges from the evidence. Clearly there are good and bad landlords and good and bad tenants.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I seek to reassure the Minister that having seen the property and the people concerned, there could not possibly be another side to that story? This is blatant harassment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall come to the clause on harassment shortly. I assure the honourable Gentleman that I shall consider sympathetically the case for a written lease. Many of the honourable Gentleman's points could be taken care of under that heading. The landlord should have given a written lease anyway, as it was evidently for more than one year.<br><br>
Clause 24 provides the mechanism for arbitrating between landlord and tenant under a statutory assured tenancy, when the landlord proposes a new rent. I trust that the Committee will accept that as a fair arrangement. I could speak at greater length on the clause if the honourable Gentleman wished me to.</span></p>

DETERMINATION OF RENT BY RENT ASSESSMENT COMMITTEE</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 206, in page 15, line 32, leave out from second 'the' to end of line 33 and insert
<br><blockquote><p>'period to which the new rent specified in the notice relates'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 207, 208, 209 and 216, and amendment No. 273, in page 16, line 12, at end insert

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 740</span>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 206 and 207 purely clarify the drafting.<br><br>
With regard to amendments Nos. 207 and 208, it appears to be common ground that there should be some limit to the rent assessment committee's discretion to postpone the date when the new rent will come into effect. The amendments would set that limit at the date of the committee's determination, as seems right. The committee will determine the rent in the light of evidence available to it at that time. It would not make sense for it to reach a decision bout what the rent should be today and then to say that it should not come into effect for six months, a year or five years.<br><br>
Amendment No. 273, to which no doubt the honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) will speak, will set the limit one year after the committee's determination. That does not make sense, for the reasons that I have given. I therefore hope that the Committee will support amendments Nos. 208 and 209 rather than amendment No. 273.<br><br>
Amendment No. 216 simply ensures that clause 31 (4)(c) achieves the intended effect, that rent increases should be allowed no more often than once a year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 273 was tabled in the vain hope of injecting a little assurance into the assured tenancies. The Minister keeps on using the term "assured tenancy", which I think is intended to engender some feeling of security and reasonableness into the procedure that is not really there. I suppose it is too much to expect him to accept the Opposition's positive amendment.</span></p>
<p>6.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is common ground in the Committee that the rent assessment committee will not be able to postpone indefinitely the application of a new rent. The affect of the amendment would set the limit a year after the determination. Taking all the cicumstances into account, we think that that is not appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was worth a try.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 272, in page 16, line 8, leave out
<br><blockquote><p>the rent under the tenancy'</p></blockquote>
and insert 'apply'. The clause is drafted in such a way that it could be interpreted as meaning that it will be binding upon the committee to determine the remit at the level requested by the landlord. Hence the reason for removing the phrase.
<br><blockquote><p>"be the rent under the tenancy".</p></blockquote>
If that were replaced with the word "apply", it would lead to greater clarification of the intention of subsection (4).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, the intention is admirable and I appreciate the honourable Gentleman's attempt to simplify the drafting by means of amendment No. 272. However, the proposed amendment could reduce the tenant's protection. By stipulating, as the clause does at present, that the new rent will be the rent

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 741</span>
payable under the tenancy, it replaces any other rent that might otherwise appear to be payable. By simply making the new rent apply, that protection for the tenant could be lessened. I hope therefore that the honourable Member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram) will withdraw the amendment, as it does not achieve the purpose that he intended.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 210, in page 16, line 17, after 'above' insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(a) supersedes any term of an assured tenancy under which the rent for a particular period of the tenancy will or may be greater than the rent for an earlier period;</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(b)'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment simply clarifies what was always our intention. If the original tenancy agreement includes a formula for increasing the rent, perhaps by a certain percentage a year, the landlord should not have to go through the clause 24 procedure every time an increase under the formula is due. With that brief explanation, I hope that the Committee will accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: honourable Friend the Minister was admirably brief, but on reading the clause it does not seem to me that that is what it says. It does not say that there is an agreement for a formula such as that the rent will increase by £1 a year or 10 per cent. or 1 per cent. a month or 20 per cent. every six months or whatever it may be. The Bill merely refers to an agreement that there shall be in an increase in the rent. That is not my idea of a formula. That is a blank formula or a blank cheque.<br><br>
Clause 25 seems to enable a landlord to get round the appeal procedure of clause 24. Clause 25 does not specify that it has to be a formula. If a tenant and landlord agree to a lease whereby the rent automatically increases with the rate of inflation as agreed or at such-aand-such a percentage, that is an agreement and it would be quite wrong that either party, having entered into it, could then appeal against it. But that is not what clause 25 says. It says nothing about a formula. It would be sufficient for it to say that
<br><blockquote><p>"landlord and tenant hereby agree that the rent will be increased" every six months or after 12 months or after two years. In those circumstances, the landlord would be able to make any increase without any appeal under clause 24.</p></blockquote>
Clause 25 seems to me to be deficient in the formula
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 742</span>
concept that my honourable Friend the Minister stated because it does not say that there must be an agreement between the tenant and the landlord about what the increases are to be before the appeal procedure for the tenant flies off. If the landlord wished to get out of the procedures under clause 24, he would merely have to have a "formula"—in inverted commas—whereby he stated that the rent would be increased once every six months or once every year or once every Whitsun or whatever it was. The clause does not specify that the tenant has to agree to what proportion or related amount such increase will be.<br><br>
I understand the equity of the situation whereby the tenant agrees that the rent will go up by 1 per cent. every six months. He should not be allowed to take the property on that basis and then appeal against what is agreed. But to ask the tenant to be allowed to agree to something that is open and then to say that that is a formula and that clause 24 does not apply seems to me to be wrong.<br><br>
I ask the Minister to table an amendment to make it absolutely clear that clause 25 does not get a landlord out of clause 24.</span></p>

<p><i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
<p>6.55 p.m.</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) was right to say that there was nothing in the amendment but a kind of percentage formula to which the Minister referred. He was equally right that what the Minister was advocating was a blank cheque for landlords. That is the essence of the amendment.<br><br>
I know that the Minister likes to be seen as a protector of tenants' rights, but the whole tenor of the Bill denies such a claim. If he sticks with this amendment, he will show clearly that it is hypocritical of him to pretend that he is a friend of tenants, because it goes decisively and directly against the interests of tenants.<br><br>
Clause 24 gives tenants the right to refer proposed increases to rent assessment committees, and clause 25 gives those committees a statutory obligation to determine a rent where the notice of a rent increase has been properly prepared. The amendment would render absolutely meaningless the rights given by the two clauses.<br><br>
Landlords would be able to specify in the contracts that they enter into with tenants built-in rent rises which may, under the terms of the contract, be wholly unfair. The Government's amendment does not even require the landlord to specify the rent rise for any future period. He simply has to include a term stating that a rent increase will be due after a certain period—perhaps two or three months. The tenant is thereby contractually bound to an unknown rent rise shortly after signing the contract. The landlord will then be free to increase the rent as he desires.<br><br>
The Minister has shown already today that he is in favour of oral agreements between landlords and tenants rather than written ones. But he seems to be suggesting here that a landlord can say to a tenant, "I have put a bit in the contract that after two or three months there will be a rent rise. What that means is that you will be paying £1 a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0486">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 743</span>
week more." He has merely to say it. He does not have to write it down. The contract has to say only that there will be an unspecified rent rise, and after two or three months the landlord can put it up by £10 a week and the tenant would be powerless to do anything about it because there is only a verbal agreement between himself and the landlord.<br><br>
It would not do for the Minister to suggest that prospective tenants should look after themselves and should not enter into agreements of that kind with landlords. He knows well that landlords and tenants are in no sense equal in bargaining power. He knows the statistics in Scotland—perhaps not very well, because he keeps misleading the Committee about statistics. A million and a quarter Scots live in overcrowded conditions, and tens of thousands of Scottish families live in damp houses or are homeless. These people, desperate to find accommodation, are easily bullied by landlords into accepting contracts of any nature, if it means that at least they will get a roof over their heads.<br><br>
7.00 p.m.<br><br>
The Minister should not try to argue that landlords will not seek to abuse the amendment as it stands. Some landlords will certainly abuse their position as landlords. During the break I was speaking to my honourable Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe), who was telling me about two houses in her constituency which are exactly next to each other. One is owned by a housing association, the other by a private landlord. Both are rented out. Both tenants pay the same rent, but for the housing association rent one gets a house that has been completely modernised and refurbished, in excellent condition, whereas for the private sector rent one gets a house that has not been rewired in 40 years, has uneven floorboards, and has nothing spent on it. It is tantamount to the private landlord's exploiting the tenant. That is the reality of Scotland's housing. The Minister must face that reality. His amendment would make it possible for unscrupulous landlords completey to ignore the tenant's rights in clauses 24 and 25, because of the amendment which he is trying to carry.<br><br>
It is especially serious for people on housing benefit. They are likely to find that the rent for housing benefit purposes is assessed as lower than the rent they have contracted to pay to the landlord under the amendment. The proposed new changes to the housing benefits scheme means that, when a tenant applies for housing benefit, the local authority must refer the rent payable to the rent officer. If he considers it too high, he will make an assessment and supply that figure to the local authority. Local authorities will be reluctant to pay housing benefit based on a rent higher than that assessed by the rent officer, because of the Government's intention to restrict the subsidy paid for housing benefit purposes to the rent assessed by the rent officer. In that case, the housing benefit may be withdrawn, because of the difference between what the rent officer has assessed the rent to be, and the actual rent which the tenant had contracted to pay the landlord. Ultimately that would mean the eviction of the tenant.<br><br>
We appeal to the Minister on this. I am sure that is not the intention of the amendment, but in reality that is what will happen. It has been recognised by the honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross and the Minister should recognise it, too. he should withdraw the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 744</span>
amendment. If he seeks to protect the position about which he spoke briefly at the beginning of this debate, he may come back on Report with a different amendment which does not leave this wide loophole which can be exploited by bad landlords.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have considered with some care the points made by my honourable and learned Friend the Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) and the honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion). It is our intention that, if there were any uncertainty about the amount of rent at the time it became due, the matter should be within the jurisdiction of the rent assessment committee. Having said that, I will look again at the drafting. I beg to task leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 25 provides for a determination of rent by rent assessment committees. I advise the Minister to say a little about the history and work of rent assessment committees, and the extra workload which they are likely to have to shoulder as a consequence of this legislation, what are their resources, what is their expertise, and what is their staff. Can he tell us something of the nature of the work that they have been doing up to now, and whether they are equipped to do the job with the government have in mind for them under this legislation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They certainly have the expertise, without question. As for staff, I mentioned in an earlier debate that it may be necessary to employ more staff for this purpose, and I recognise that suitable and adequate funding arrangements will have to be made for that. The clause provides that the rent assessment committee will adjudicate on proposed rent increases by reference to the rents prevailing in the open market. A rent determined by the committee will be the rent payable, unless the landlord and tenant agree otherwise. I could speak at greater length, but I suspect that it is not necessary.</span></p>

ACCESS FOR REPAIRS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 412, in page 16, line 21, after 'landlord', insert 'reasonable'.<br><br>
Anyone would accept that clause 26 is a reasonable clause to have in such a Bill, in that the landlord must have reasonable access to his or her property, to effect any repairs that are necessary. None of us would want to detract from that. However, it seems only right that we insert the word "reasonable", a word that appears a number of times in most other housing Acts. The Bill is one of the few where "reasonable" seems to have been expunged throughout. None the less, it appears in other
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0487">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 745</span>
housing Acts, and we believe that reasonable access should be granted, so that a landlord cannot demand access at a moment's notice if that is unreasonable. If the roof is leaking, or some defect visible from the outside has not been noticed, it would not be unreasonable for the landlord to try to seek instant access; but the term "reasonable" here would permit the landlord and tenant to reach an agreement on access where that was necessary, so that the landlord was not entitled to use his or her keys to gain entry to the property at a time that was inconvenient to the tenant, either by reason of being late at night or early in the morning, in particular if the tenant or the spouse is a lady, and is alone, or feels vulnerable, or if the tenant is a shift worker. The insertion of the word "reasonable" will cause landlords to ensure that their relations with the tenants are not damaged in any way, and would deter those landlords—there are some—who might make unreasonable demands for access.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is common ground on the fact that the landlord must carry out necessary repairs. I should start by explaining that the origin of the words in clause 26 is in section 111 of the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984, which is our current rent legislation. We should be careful not to change a form of words that has served us well unless there is good reason to do so, and to the best of my knowledge there have been no instances of gross abuse in this connection. I do not believe that amendment No. 412 would in practice add anything to the existing clause, and in the context of the clause, offering reasonable access could mean just about anything. I do not consider that the honourable Gentleman's amendment is necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are concerned that the thrust of the Bill is to give landlords rights which go beyond rights which can be agreed unanimously on in the Committee or elsewhere. The terms set out in the 1984 Act may be such that the Act taken as a whole allows landlords to know what limits they can go up to and not overreach, although I know of cases of that happening in my constituency. But when a Bill is seen to be removing considerable rights from tenants and strengthening the rights of landlords, in some cases making them draconian, it is not valid to take a section from an Act where that set of circumstances did not pertain and insert it willy-nilly into the Bill. We want to redress the balance, and by inserting "reasonable" into the clause we believe that we are doing that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairburn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If "reasonable" does not add anything to the Bill, it does not subtract anything either. I do not know what "afford" means—I can rarely afford anything—but it does not seem very controversial to afford the landlord "reasonable access".<br><br>
If the landlord has a set of keys and the tenant is in bed with his daughter and somebody breaks in to see whether the roof needs mending, "reasonable" implies that he
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 746</span>
asks whether it is convenient. It is only one word, and there are plenty in the Bill already.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to support the contribution by the honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn). I agree with what he said, but I would go further and say that "reasonable" does add something.<br><br>
The concept of reasonableness is well known in the law of Scotland and it applies a test. I have had some experience—not a great deal, I admit—of landlords abusing their right of access and turning what would appear to be a perfectly ordinary and innocuous right into one which is verging on harassment, if it is not harassment itself. For instance, repairs may not be necessary, but the landlord says, "We'll come and check the meter", or "We'll come and check the sink" or "We'll come and do this". These examples always appear in conflicts between the landlord and the tenant.<br><br>
The amendment would allow the test to be applied: is it reasonable for a landlord to require access? As the honourable and learned Gentleman says, while there are many words in the Bill, and many unnecessary words, this one may add a wee bit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before my honourable Friend the Minister replies, and while the lawyers chat among themselves—it is always fascinating to listen to them—I should say that as a layman I am very much influenced by what is considered reasonable. My wife's view of what is reasonable is entirely different from mine from time to time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: She is probably right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the honourable Gentleman does not know whether she is approving or not, I agree: she is probably more often right than wrong. The view that she takes is that I am always being too reasonable. The honourable Gentleman is astonished, because he thought that she was viewing things in an entirely different light. He has made the very point that I have been trying to make, and I thank him very much.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the theme of my first speech this morning was that in a spirit of reasonableness I would listen with an open mind to all amendments, it is hard for me to resist an amendment which proposes the use of that word. I do not believe that it is strictly necessary or that it would add much, but nor do I think that it would do any harm. If it makes the honourable Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) happier and if he feels that it might make the position a little clearer, I am happy to agree to the amendment.</span></p>
