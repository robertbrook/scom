	<p>[Continued from col. 1178]</p>
	<p>11.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By unhappy coincidence, I had just come to my peroration when the Committee was suspended, but my hon. Friends and I had made our case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only point that I wish to make is to the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran). A change of landlord will not affect the rights of a tenant or his spouse under the tenancy, which will continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) wish to withdraw the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) moved the amendment, and that creates a difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>The Chairman's 	<i>attention having been called to the fact that six Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the room and six Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government have now obtained a quorum. That was the third occasion on which we have not had a quorum in the Committee, which suggests that Whipping has been lax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that tenants will be no worse off if there is a change of landlord, but that is always far from the truth with assured tenancies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire has now returned to the Committee and will decide how to proceed with the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This excellent group of amendments would achieve exactly what Labour Members wish. The Minister does not like the amendments because they are excellent and the hon. Gentleman should argue for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a useful debate, but I reserve the right to return to this important matter. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1180</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 523, in page 36, line 44, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"and such approval shall only be given if the disposal is to another approved person or a public sector landlord".</p></blockquote>
This amendment would allow onward disposal of a property acquired under part III only to an approved person or public sector landlord. There is much to be said for facilitating the return of such property into the public sector and the amendment would allow the housing needs of people in Scotland to be provided for—	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is a lot of background noise and it is difficult for me to hear the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had already sat down, Mr. Martin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 60 is designed to ensure that is not possible to circumvent the rule set out in clause 52 that all transfers under tenants' choice should be to landlords approved by Scottish Homes, or to Scottish Homes. The requirement that Scottish Homes must approve the first disposal by a receiving landlord of any property taken over under the tenants' choice arrangements will prevent any possibility of collusion, however unlikely, between and approved landlord and another landlord, by means of which the second landlord might have been able to take over the property. The clause is a protection for the transferring tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want to restrict Scottish Homes' discretion as suggested. For a number of good reasons—for example, the death of the tenant, or the voluntary ending of his or her tenancy—the house transferred may be vacated. It would be wrong in such circumstances to rule out the possibility, subject to Scottish Homes' approval, of the new landlord selling the house for owner-occupation if he or she wished. This amendment would prevent sales except for further renting, and is therefore unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Member will be prepared to withdraw this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was an interesting reply, because it showed that the Bill is likely further to reduce the amount of housing that is available to let in Scotland, although the Government continually protest that the thrust of the legislation is to encourage private sector letting. The Minister acknowledged that that will not be so and that housing stock that is removed from circulation in that way is unlikely to be available for letting again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having exposed that point, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 298, in page 37, line 8, at end insert—
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3A) In giving consent under this section, Scottish Homes shall have regard to the need to preserve the stock of houses required to meet the demands for rented housing in each locality.".</p></blockquote>
This is a simple amendment. Its purpose is to safeguard the supply of housing for rent. It would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0729">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1181</span>
give Scottish Homes a permissive power to have regard to the need to preserve the stock of houses required to meet the demand for rented housing in each area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish Homes should have some discretion and power to consider the position when hot spots develop and the amount of housing stock available to local authorities approaches the basic threshold' for sensible, strategic management of housing. The amendment would not impose onerous duties on Scottish Homes, which will have to keep a careful eye on the balance of stock in various regions, especially rural areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood). The purpose of his amendment is to safeguard the stock of rented housing. I have not been persuaded, however, that I should accept this amendment, I agree that in considering applications by landlords which have taken over property under the tenants' choice arrangements for approval to the first subsequent disposal of such property, Scottish Homes will be expected to take into account a number of factors. If, for example, the intention is that the property is to continue to be rented, I would expect Scottish Homes to be prepared, without difficulty, to approve disposals to another landlord on its list of approved landlords. Indeed, the general consent power in clause 60(2) might be appropriate in such cases. It may be, however, that for good reason—for example, the death of the tenant, or the tenant voluntarily ending his tenancy—that an option is open to the landlord to sell the house inot owner occupation. If believe that Scottish Homes' ability to approve such a sale should not be unduly circumscribed. None the less, I think it entirely reasonable that, before deciding whether to approve such an application, Scottish Homes should indeed have regard to the availability of housing for rent in the locality. On the other hand, I do not share the Opposition's view that the percentage of housing available for rent should be ossified at any particular level, and I would not want it to appear, by the inclusion of the new subsection which this amendment suggests, that this was the only criterion to which Scottish Homes should have regard when considering applications. I would not wish Scottish Homes' discretion to be fettered unduly by the inclusion in the Bill of a long list of points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us suppose that a local authority or public sector landlord could demonstrate to Scottish Homes' satisfaction that there was pressure on housing stock and that it was becoming difficult to supply the demand for rented tenancies in the public sector. Would Scottish Homes take that into account?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I would certainly expect Scottish Homes to take such matters into account. That would be only reasonable. But circumstances change and it is unnecessary to write too many prescriptions into the Bill. It is desirable to leave Scottish Homes to exercise the powers in the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1182</span>
Bill under guidance from the Secretary of State but without every factor that it must take into account being set out in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the hon. Gentleman that in guidance to Scottish Homes on how it should carry out its statutory duties we shall draw its attention to the need to consider the point illustrated in amendment No. 298 and other factors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make a simple point, which may seem pedantic. I asked the Minister a detailed question on the operation of the Matrimonial Homes and Family Proceedings Act 1984. He obtained some inspiration from his advisers and I shall be interested to hear his reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I answered the hon. Gentleman's question before he returned from drinking his cup of chocolate. Earlier today we considered an amendment on that subject and we have the matter in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 60, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 61 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 62</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>ABOLITION OF LOCAL AUTHORITY'S POWER TO REFER PART VII CONTRACTS TO RENT ASSESSMENT COMMITTEES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause provides for the abolition of a local authority's power to refer part VII contracts to rent assessment committees. We have debated part VII contracts and the Government's intention to phase them out. The clause may reduce the protection that the rent assessment committees provide for people with a twilight form of tenure. Will the Minister explain why that protection is being reduced?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 62 removes the power of the local authority to refer the rent of a part VII contract under the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 to the rent assessment committee for determination. This power has been used very little by local authorities and, of course, both landlord and tenant will retain the right to apply direct to the rent assessment committee. In any case, the Bill provides for the phasing out of part VII contracts, which are generally for fairly short periods, so any power to refer rents to them for determination will soon no longer be relevant at all. Holders of part VIII contracts will be able to refer their rents to rent assessment committees, but local authorities will not be able to do so on their behalf.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the Conservative party manifesto in 1987, which was resoundingly rejected by the people of Scotland, included an undertaking to extend the power of local authorities to refer cases to the rent officer. That was one of the few redeeming features in the manifesto. I wonder why there has been a significant change of heart by the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said correctly that our manifesto contained a promise to give local authorities the power to refer rents for regulated tenancies to the rent officer for the registration of rent, but the proposals in the Bill overtake that. Our provisions to prevent the abuse of housing benefit will also encourage the registration of rents for regulated tenancies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>RENT OFFICERS: ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONS RELATING TO HOUSING BENEFIT ETC</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 460, in page 38, line 12, leave out—
	<br><blockquote><p>"housing benefit and".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 461, in page 38, line 32, leave out—

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>12 midnight</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am particularly worried about the Government's breach of trust in the operation of housing benefit. The amendments seek to remove from the discretion of the Secretary of State, as far as is possible, matters relating to housing benefit. It is tragic that the Government, having lured many people—including the disabled—into tenancies that depend on housing benefit, should by regulation have eroded people's entitlement to housing benefit. Moreover, they have removed it from so many people that they can scarcely be trusted to have any discretionary powers over housing benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's credibility in the operation of housing benefit is non-existent. The housing benefit regulations that were passed on 19 November last year resulted in a reduction in the entitlement to housing benefit of 4 million claimants on supplementary benefit. The problems for people who depend on housing benefit were made much worse by those regulations. At that time, the Government clawed back £640 million which they would have had to pay under the previous system. There is little doubt that the various changes in housing benefit regulations that the Secretary of State may require from rent officers are unlikely to extend housing benefit. If past performance is anything to go by, they are more likely to restrict it further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1184</span>
Under the legislation passed last November, a million people lost their housing benefit. That position will be perpetuated and probably exacerbated by the power provided to the Secretary of State in the clause. Last November, the Government excluded claimants from benefit if they had a capital sum over £6,000 and started means-testing them on any amount over £3,000. That hit many unemployed people who had perhaps during their working lives saved some money as well as those who had negotiated redundancy terms. If the clause is not amended, such discrimination will be perpetuated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some areas, two out of five senior citizens lost all entitlement to benefit following the decision on 19 November. That applies to one in five pensioner households in many areas. Some 350,000 claimants lost their entitlement to housing benefit. We seek to tie the hands of the Secretary of State to prevent him from making the position worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Government took office, the combined rent and rate tapers stood at 23 per cent, of gross income. From next month, they will be fixed at 56 per cent, of gross income. In the past eight years, the Government have doubled the rate at which housing benefit is reduced for every successive increase in income. They have deliberately constructed a ferocious poverty trap. We have no intention of allowing clause 64 to remain as drafted as it will intensify that trap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From April, the entitlement to housing benefit of a single person paying an average rent will be extinguished when he achieves a net weekly income of £60. A married couple with a child paying an average rent will have their entitlement to housing benefit removed entirely when they achieve a net weekly income of £95. If we consider the average incomes in Britain today, that family's entitlement to housing benefit will disappear when they are still earning less than half the average income of the population. Clause 64 will allow the Secretary of State to require rent officers to perpetuate the problems that will arise after April.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has a nerve to include housing benefit in the Bill at all. When the Government incroduced housing benefit, it was supposed to simplify the old system. In fact, it is more complicated and many people are undoubtedly losing what little benefit they are entitled to because of that complexity. I was a welfare rights officer for 10 years and I know that the housing benefit system is the most complicated aspect of all Government welfare legislation. That is widely recognised, which is why the Government have had to change the regulations. Some of the shadiest landlords in the country have run away with handfuls of Government and taxpayers' gold at the expense of many elderly and handicapped people who are the victims of the undesirable hostels that such landlords have established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leads me to refer to some desirable hostels and the views of organisations such as. Edinvar in Edinburgh. On 19 February, that organisation wrote to the Secretary of State drawing his attention to the great problems that will result from the new income support and housing benefit regulations. Those problems relate directly to subsection (1). Edinvar
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0731">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1185</span>
referred to its neighbour support housing scheme which provides supported accommodation for people with a mental handicap, the support costs being met through a service charge as part of the rent. As the Minister opened the project, he will know that the scheme enables mentally handicapped adults to be kept in the community on the basis of the rent and service charge and allows neighbours to share the responsibility of caring for them. The scheme establishes a perfect mix so that a street or a block of flats does not contain all mentally handicapped people. There is a desirable mix of mentally handicapped people and others living within the community. Schemes of that kind are threatened by the Government's housing benefit regulations. We therefore would not endorse any mention of housing benefit in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Edinvar warns that, after April, housing benefit will not be available to tenants for the support that they receive and the viability of its sheltered housing project will be threatened. At present, each tenant in the neighbour support housing scheme pays a rent of £45 per week which until April is eligible in full for housing benefit. After April, however, the housing benefit regulations will disallow the part of the rent which relates to support costs and each tenant will receive £30 less in housing benefit. They will then have no income to meet the support costs and this will place the viability of the community care scheme in jeopardy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister opened that scheme on 28 August last year. In commending it, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Here, we have a project which seems to have all the elements for a new sense of community. Living here will, of course, be new families—but also some of the old residents from the area are returning to enjoy the benefits of modern housing. There will be young people having their first experience of independent living and some disabled people who will have a new opportunity to live independent lives."</p></blockquote>
The Minister concluded by saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"However we are here today to mark the opening of this development and to look forward to its future."</p></blockquote>
Sadly, although that opening ceremony took place only a few months ago, the development is jeopardised by the Government's attempts to skimp and scrape to save money at the expense of some of the poorest members of society through the housing benefit regulations. That is why we have no hesitation in trying to strike any mention of housing benefit from the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other organisations have made representations to the Committee and I am surprised that the Minister has not been struck by the force of their arguments. As far as I know, Edinvar has not received a reply from the Secretary of State for Scotland, though doubtless one is on its way. I know that the right hon. Gentleman has had, in his terms, more important matters to deal with such as the press, Paisley grammar school and a few other party political issues, and that his concern for people is slight in comparison with them. None the less, if he had listened to some of the arguments in favour of the amendments, as he is a rational person, he could not have failed to be impressed by their force.

The problem is that rent officers will determine what constitutes a reasonable rent for the purposes of housing benefit entitlement and rental subsidy payments. Furthermore, the proposal is that rent officers should be involved in deciding whether tenants are occupying accommodation which was unnecessarily large or expensive in the light of their circumstances. On Second Reading, the Secretary of State made a telling admission when he introduced the word "luxury", which does not appear in the Bill. He implied that a house with extra bedrooms which someone may have occupied for a considerable time but which had outgrown his needs was a luxury. Most people would regard such circumstances as ordinary. Given the state of the housing market, most people have to occupy houses for a considerable time and if grown up members of the family move out they will be left with surplus bedrooms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of clause 64 seems to be to enable the Secretary of State to implement proposals by way of a statutory instrument. As the effect would be to remove people from their homes or their entitlement to housing benefit, we find that deeply offensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Federation of Housing Associations believes that there is a fundamental contradiction between the dual roles proposed for rent officers. On the one hand, they will continue to register fair rents for existing tenants, which is an independent role intended to protect tenants. On the other hand, they will determine what constitutes a reasonable rent for the purposes of housing benefit and rental subsidy entitlements. That is a role designed to protect the Government's funding and we believe that its aim is to ensure that the Government obtain further windfall savings at the expense of the poorest members of society so as to give benefits to the rich, to help some people to plant more trees in Scotland but not to help people to put down roots in suitable housing. In the view of the SFHA, the existing role of rent officers is incompatible with their proposed role as policemen of the housing benefit system. The Government will need plenty of policemen for that system because the people of this country strongly object to the removal of the right to subsidies for housing from those on low incomes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A rent officer may visit two flats in a tenement building on the same day in one case to reregister a fair rent and in the other to determine whether the rent being charged is acceptable for the payment of housing benefit. We agree with the SFHA's submission that that dual function cannot be carried out effectively by one person. The rules are contradictory. That should be apparent to the Minister and the Conservative party.

Several Government consultation papers make it clear that Scottish Homes will have a function of monitoring the rents of housing association properties and we know that those rents will tend to be below what the Government describe as market levels. It might be accepted that controls apply to the payment of subsidy to fund the housing benefit system, but I believe that there is widespread concern because by vesting control in rent officers, and

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1187</span>
through them in the Secretary of State, the net result will be that the eligibility of an occupant for housing benefit will be determined by the size and nature of the property that he occupies. No consideration will be given to whether the tenant is an elderly person who has outgrown the house but does not want to move, perhaps because the landlord has not offered suitable alternative accommodation locally. After all, there is a national housing shortage. There may be other resons why people wish to stay where they are. Someone who has lived for 60 or 70 years in the same house may not feel like moving anyway. There need not be anything rational is a person's decision to remain where he is. Those who have paid rent for a place in which they have lived for most of their lives are entitled to sit tight in it even when it is transferred to another landlord and they have agreed to the transfer. Such people will have worked for most of their working lives—at least up to 1979. Having contributed to the total pool of public money and the public weal, they are entitled to draw on that pool in their old age. Winston Churchill, Lloyd George and everyone else accepted that view until the emergence of the new monetarism of Margaret Thatcher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to ensure the right of people to sit tight without being harried, hassled and hounded by the Government and their rent officers. With that in mind, I commend the amendments to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sense that the Committee wishes to make progress, but this is an extremely important clause and this group of amendments enables us to discuss its general bearing on housing benefits. The clause is the sting in the tail of the Bill and it could cause severe hardship to people on very low incomes in Scotland, especially as it comes only a month before the introduction of the income support scheme under the social security review. I understand that for every £1 of income above the income support threshold, claimants will suffer an 85p reduction in housing benefit, so a couple with a income of as little as £75 per week would be about £20 above the threshold and would thus receive no housing benefit and have to pay the full rent. Those are disturbing circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer briefly to Government document, "Deregulation of the Private Rented Sector: Consultation Paper on the Implication for Housing Benefit." Paragraph 3 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"With an increasing proportion of rents in future not subject to statutory rent control, it will be particularly important to ensure, where a tenant's rent is being met, in whole or in part, by public funds through housing benefit, that the rent which attracts such support is not unreasonable."</p></blockquote>
So far, so good. The logical thing would be to establish a provision to keep rents at a fair level, but that is too logical for the Government. The purpose of the clause is not to ensure that excessive rents are reduced, but to penalise the tenant if the landlord is charging to much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 5 of the consultation paper states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government also intend to provide, as soon as the necessary information for setting limits is available, that benefit should not be payable in full on the rents for the most expensive privately
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1188</span>
rented properties in each local authority area. The Government will introduce further limits on benefit should that prove necessary."</p></blockquote>
That seems to be the wrong way of going about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 23 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In due course it is intended that regulations will be made by the Secretary of State for Social Services specifying where the necessary limits will be set. Once such regulations are made, in cases where the rent is above the limit, the local authority will calculate benefit on rent only up to the limit specified."</p></blockquote>
The rub is this:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the claimant chooses to remain in accommodation with a higher rent, he will have to make up the difference from his own resources. Subsidy will, of course, only be paid on benefit awarded on rent up to the limit."</p></blockquote>
A father desperate to house his family may find that his only choice is to avail himself of all that private sector accommodation that the Government say they will bring on to the market but he may find that he can rent such a property only by signing the lease of an assured tenancy with a high rent. Within weeks of taking on that commitment, he could find that his rent was not covered by housing benefit and he would be in terrible trouble because he could not pay his rent. He and his family would then be evicted. That is a recipe for great hardship, as has been highlighted in representations made to us by organisations such as Shelter, the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, COSLA, the Scottish Council for Single Homeless and many others. The clause is vicious and even the Minister should be ashamed of the reference to housing benefit. I strongly support my hon. Friend's argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will justify the change of role of rent officers, whose present job is to police the landlords. They register fair rents and refer disputes between landlords and tenants to the rent assessment committees. In future, their role will be different. The Minister is expecting them to undergo a role reversal. The Government's paper on the implications for housing benefit makes that clear. It says that rent officers will be expected to exercise their normal professional judgement in making decisions about how much housing benefit should be granted. In exercising their professional judgement they will have to bear in mind that their role is to protect public funds. The Secretary of State for Scotland will issue guidance to assist them in that. They will have the Secretary of State for Scotland breathing down their necks telling them that their job is to protect public funds and to ensure that tenants do not get housing benefit for rents that the Government believe to be unjustifiably high. It will be a sad day when rent officers are turned against the very people whom they now work to protect. Will the Minister reconsider whether rent officers should decide whether housing benefit claimants are over-accommodated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right that rent officers should consider whether rents are reasonable. It would be wrong for private sector landlords to be partly funded by the public subsidy of housing benefit. The information paper sets out detailed formula allowing rent officers to judge whether rents are too high and ensuring that private sector landlords are not trying to rip off the public purse. The rent officer will have to find the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0733">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1189</span>
address of the accommodation, whether it is furnished, the number of rooms, details about the occupants, and the rent. But when it comes to deciding whether the tenants are over-accommodated, the information paper says only that reference will be made to a "more detailed test" than that for the reasonableness of the rent We are not given any information about what that the detailed test will be. The Committee is being asked to support the Bill, but we do not know what sort of people will be deciding whether tenants are over-accommodated. The consultation paper refers only to
	<br><blockquote><p>"a maximum number of rooms or floorspace for particular family sizes."</p></blockquote>
The words "or floorspace" suggest that the Government are prepared to say that only one room is necessary for some housing benefit claimants. The Minister should give a detailed explanation of the tests that will be applied by rent officers in judging whether housing benefit claimants are over-accommodated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same is true of rent officers' other roles, including whether the rent of any claimant of housing benefit is unnecessarily expensive. We are told that that tests will be applied only to the most expensive properties in a local authority area, at the top end of the market. But we are not told exactly what that means. The information paper says that regulations will be made specifying the necessary limits and rents, so that rent officers can apply them, but we are told only that they are at the top end of the market—whatever that may mean. Are we expected to go along with that and give the Government a blank cheque? It is to be applied indiscriminately. It will not matter whether the housing benefit claimant lives on his own, or whether he has a family. All claimants will all be treated the same. The Minister should tell us more about how that part of the Bill will operate how rent officers will apply those principles and what impact they will have on tenants before he can expect the Committee to support him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is ironic that a Bill intended to remove most of the rights of tenants, especially the phasing provisions for rent increases, will have such an impact on rents as to cause a substantial inflationary twist. The Bill removes the present provisions under which registered rents are more or less accepted for housing benefit purposes, with little scrutiny. Certain tests are applied, but not rigorously. I wish to see an examination of rents that are paid for by housing benefit because they are a substantial subsidy to landlords in the private sector. I referred earlier to other forms of subsidy, such as improvement and repairs grants, but housing benefit is the most glaring area and checks are infrequent. The Bill contains no test for the landlord—it will simply squeeze the tenant. Once enacted, it will lead to inflation in rents in private tenancies in Scotland, and tenants will be squeezed still further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not expect the Minister to pull something out of the hat to please us all, and to accept the amendments. The measure is approved by the Government, and the Minister's brief will tell him
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1190</span>
to stand rock steady and to resist all attempts to amend the clause. We must be clear about what the Government are doing and recognise the ease with which they are pushing the legislation through. It will benefit landlords hugely, yet it is trumpeted as improving tenants' access to housing by creating flexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This provision, together with the change in the housing benefit regulations, will create homelessness. Rent officers will strike rents and even though in many cases they may be lower than the rents the private landlors seek, some tenants—for example, those on supplementary benefit or low incomes— will find that they cannot afford to hold and will be forces out of their property. Supplementary benefit is paid at subsistence level and contains no housing element, although there may eventually be an element for poll tax. These tenants, whom the Government are trying to encourage into the private sector, will have to pay 20 per cent, of their poll tax and may also find a substantial gap between the rent asked in their contracts with their landlords, and what the state is prepared to offer by way of subsidy. We are creating homelessness through the Government's dogmatic belief that it is the landlords who are suffering now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is our experience—and no doubt the Minister's—from surgery cases that at present there are considerable delays in the benefits, both in the assessment and the processing of applications, and in the eventual payment of benefit, whether to the tenant or direct to the landlord. The delays will be exacerbated by the need for the extra stage—the referral to the rent officer in the initial stages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is removing much of the protection at present enjoyed by tenants. Schedule 5 makes certain cases of rent arrears a mandatory ground for the sheriff to evict, yet the Government are building further delays into a process that already suffers from bureaucracy and the difficulty of processing forms in bulk quickly. Tenants are being placed at risk of eviction—even if they are not being thrown out into the streets—which neither they nor the sheriff can do anything to prevent. He cannot exercise discretion and say, "This is not the tenant's fault; it is the fault of the system, and the rent will be paid eventually once the local authority sorts itself out, or the rent officer sorts himself out and deal's with the cases before him."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The delays will put many tenants at risk of eviction. I am not expecting the Minister to pop up and say that he has had a magical change of heart, as I do not think that he is in control of the situation, but is forced to do what his masters in London decree. These issues must be recorded, and if the Minister can ever have a word in his master's ears he should bring them to their attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) mentioned a change of role. That is his interpretation.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whose side are they on then?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rent officers should be neutral, and should be as impartial as the hon. Member sitting in the Chair of this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall come to over-accommodation on the next group of amendments, so I shall answer the hon. Gentleman's comments fully then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Arguments about the housing benefit paid in particular cases have nothing to do with the clause, and I shall decline the efforts of Opposition Members to draw me into an inappropriate debate on the provisions of the Social Security Act 1986, which has already been fully debated and approved by Parliament. I can, however, lay some of the hon. Gentleman's fears to rest. The only functions that we intent to confer on rent officers under the clause are in relation to private sector tenants, including housing association tenants. We explained the outline of the proposal in one of the consultation papers we issued in November last year. The proposals are currently being fleshed out in working parties involving rent officers and the local authority association's including COSLA. My Department is also represented on the working parties, I can assure hon. Members that all our intentions have been made known. As to the amendments, a reference to housing benefit itself as well as rent allowance subsidy is necessary, since in some cases—those where the accommodation is too expensive—the rent officer's decision will directly affect the amount of benefit paid to the tenant rather than the amount of subsidy payable to the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be no conflict between the present duties of rent officers, of registering rents under regulation tenancies, and their future duties, of assessing rents for the purpose of housing benefit subsidy. In both cases, rent officers are doing what they have the professional expertise to do—determining a reasonable level of rent according to guidelines laid down for them, and within which they must operate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Is it possible that two different rental figures could be provided by the same person? From what the Minister says, the criteria will be different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is yes. I think that it is possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am staggered. That means that the same individual may look at the same property in two ways and come up with different answers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could help my hon. Friend and the Minister. The next groups of amendments deals with that question, and the Minister may have a relevant brief to read out, and we might get a more satisfactory answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has given us the most extraordinary reply. I have one further question to ask on this group of amendments before we conclude this very important debate, which should have been conducted in the full glare of publicity rather than in the wee small hours of the morning. The director of housing of my local council of East Lothian wrote to me saying:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is intended that Housing Benefit will be restricted if applicants are living in accommodation considered too large or too expensive for their needs. Any excess Benefit paid over fixed thresholds will only be subsidised by central government at a rate of 25 per cent, compared to the standard rate of 97 per cent. The Council will therefore have to devote extra resources to these cases and it is not yet clear how such action will be viewed by auditors."</p></blockquote>
Local authorities are the people who are in touch with claiments facing the difficulties created by the Government and will come face to face with the problem, day in, day out. It will become worse as rents get forced higher and the provisions remain in effect. The local authority will have the discretion to pay additional housing benefit, but faces the prospect of being penalised for helping the most needy people in their areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asks about the 25 per cent, criteria. May I explain the new duties of rent officers? The powers under clause 64 have nothing to do with existing registered rents. Separate administrative arrangements that are unconnected with clause 64 are being introduced from April this year to control or prevent abuse of housing benefit for regulated tenancies. They will operate by reducing the subsidy paid by the Exchequer to local authorities if rents are very high. In Scotland, that means 265 per cent, of the average registered rent for the area or when the rent increase is excessive—more than 13 per cent, a year. Rents above the limits set by those criteria will be subsidised at a lower rate of 25 per cent, rather than at the full rate of 97 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the earlier question asked by the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran), I repeat that different rent levels correspond to different criteria. The argument is rather like saying that a valuer may not value a house with or without development value. The argument is fallacious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has pled guilty to the charge. He has admitted that the Government intend to penalise tenants if their private sector landlords charge excessive rents. Moreover, if local authorities have the temerity to continue to support such tenants and stave off the threat of homelessness and deprivation, they, too, will be penalised. The Minister has confirmed that that is the Government's intention and he does not appear to be ashamed about that.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How on earth can it be called abuse when local authorities support those who face homelessness because they cannot afford to pay their rent? Why should a local authority be penalised for supporting people in those circumstances? If the Minister would take action to prevent landlords from charging excessive rents, he would certainly command support from us, if not from Conservative Members. It is mind boggling that he has the brass neck to seek powers from Parliament to penalise tenants and the local authorities who try to support them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond more fully on clause stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's argument is unconvincing and as weak as his voice has become. Tenants of private landlords could fall victim if they inhabit dwellings that are regarded by rent officers and the Secretary of State as being too large. Tenants of housing associations could also face similar problems. The Minister has not responded to the fears expressed by the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations. Housing associations could be forced to move tenants to alternative accommodation because a rent officer decides not to pay housing benefit on a property when a son or daughter has moved out, vacating a room, or when someone's spouse has died. That is intolerable. There is combined opposition to the regulations and we are sorry that the Government are not willing to accept that. Property could be designated as being unnecessarily expensive and that will result in tenants losing their entitlement to housing benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SFHA voices the legitimate fear that so-called refinements, such as the accommodation size or quality, might be considered when a tenant's housing benefit is being decided and the property could be designated as unnecessarily expensive. The mechanism for determining what constitutes unnecessarily expensive accommodation is imprecise and account must be taken of the quality of services and the nature of the property on which housing benefit is payable. Such mechanisms could be arbitrary and the rent officer might not take account of dwellings that have been specially adapted or provide special services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to the consultation that is taking place with local authorities and other organisations. It is ludicrous to imagine that anyone, other than the Minister or Conservative party sycophants, have confidence in that consultation. Local authorities were promised 12 months' clear notice of changes in the regulations, yet, they were
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1194</span>
drafted on 19 November, and are being implemented some five months later, despite the assurance that was given by the Secretary of State for Social Services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1983, a shambles accompanied Government interference on housing subsidies when housing benefit was introduced. According to 	<i>The Times,</i> it was the biggest administrative fiasco in the history of the welfare state.

The weaknesses in the Government's arguments have been amply exposed by my hon. Friends. In his weak and lame response, the Minister has said nothing in defence of the three crucial words "with housing benefit" that we seek to delete. His case rests on nothing more than a continuing Conservative vendetta against those who rent houses and the Government's resentment at having to subsidise them, despite their having paid taxes and making other contributions to society. Tenants will be squeezed by unscrupulous landlords adopting unsavoury practices.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It seeks to exclude from the rent officer the function of determining whether property is too large or too expensive for the purpose of restricting entitlement to housing benefit. My hon.

I hope that he will be more constructive in this debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consultation paper issued by the Government last October entitled "Deregulation of the Private Rented Sector: implications for Housing Benefit" outlined the Government's proposal to expand the role of the rent officers. It was proposed that in their new role rent officers would have regard to the determination of what constituted a reasonable rent for the purposes of determining housing benefit entitlement and rental subsidy payment. In addition, it was proposed that the rent officer should also be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0736">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1195</span>
involved in deciding whether a tenant was occupying occupation which was unnecessarily large or expensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It appears that the purpose of clause 64 is to enable the Secretary of State to implement these proposals by way of a statutory instrument. The SFHA believes that there is a fundamental contradiction in the dual role proposed for rent officers. On one hand, they will continue to register fair rents for existing tenants—that is an independent role which is intended to protect tenants. On the other they will determine what constitutes a reasonable rent for the purposes of housing benefit and rental subsidy entitlement, a role designed to protect public funds. Inevitably, those two roles will conflict with each other. The SFHA believes that the existing role of the rent officer is incompatible with the proposed role as policeman of the housing benefit system. For example, on the same day, a rent officer may visit two flats in a tenement building, one to re-register a fair rent and other to determine whether the rent being charged by the landlord is acceptable for the payment of housing benefit. The SFHA believes that that duel function cannot be credibly carried out by one officer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to property which may be regarded as unnecessarily large, it seems likely that the largest group of people likely to be affected by such restrictions would be single people. As 61 per cent, of housing association lets are to single people, the housing association movement regards the proposals with considerable anxiety. It is the view of the SFHA that it would be wholly unacceptable if, for example, an elderly widow who was occupying what was her family home was forced to move elsewhere because it was deemed to be unnecessarily large. The SFHA has several worries on that issue, apart from the undesirability of such circumstances arising. Housing associations have relatively few houses in their stock. The average community-based housing association has only 500 houses and many have fewer than that. If a tenant's entitlement to housing benefit is restricted, thereby rendering him or her unable to remain in that property, where will the tenant move to? How will the housing association or any other responsible landlord cope with the crisis that the Government will have created?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In supporting my hon. Friend, I shall point out another anomaly in the proposed system. For example, at the moment two council house tenants living next door to each other pay the same rent to the district council or to the Scottish Special Housing Association. If one of the houses goes into the private sector, as the Bill seeks to encourage, the district council or SSHA tenant will continue to pay the full rent—presumably the district council rents will be regarded as fair for housing benefit and other purposes—but the private tenant next door in exactly the same type of accommodation, perhaps with the same income if both are on supplementary benefit, may find that his or her full rent is not paid because of the application of housing benefit criteria to what will inevitably be a higher rent paid to a private landlord. That is nonsense, and it will breed unfairness and homelessness. It is staggering that the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1196</span>
Minister barefacedly parrots his brief without having the grace to acknowledge the difficulties that the legislation will create.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal specifically with the amendments relating to unnecessarily large or expensive accommodation. Hon. Members have expressed anxiety about the new function that is proposed for rent officers in relation to such accommodation. I am sure that hon. Members will agree that steps should be taken to detect and root out cases of abuse of housing benefit. There have been cases of abuse in houses in multiple occupancy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By landlords.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, of course. I hope that members of the Committee will also accept that it was to achieve that end that the proposals in clause 64 were devised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I should explain briefly how we expect the rent officer to carry out this function. Every rent for which housing benefit is claimed will be referred to the rent officer, who will have to consider whether the claimant is over-accommodated. If so, housing benefit will be restricted. With regard to accommodation that is too expensive, the position is straightforward. Quite simply, we believe it to be unjustifiable to use public money to enable people to occupy houses that are so luxurious and expensive that most ordinary people could never expect to live in them. So if a tenant chooses to live in such a house, we intend eventually to restrict directly the housing benefit that he receives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members have drawn attention to possible circumstances in which people might be treated unfairly as a result of the new arrangements. We are, of course, aware that cases might arise of people with assured tenancies who are living in a large house which was the family home but from which the rest of the family has gone. As hon. Members will be aware, discussions are now taking place involving the local authority associations, including the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. I can assure the Committee that this issue is being given very careful consideration. Obviously, however, as the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South recognised, I cannot pre-empt those discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of the explanation that I have given, and the need, to ensure that housing benefit is not abused, I hope that the amendments will not be pursued.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister consider the case of my parents, who are public sector tenants in Glasgow? My father is 81 years of age and my mother is 77. They are both on a supplementary benefit pension and receive housing benefit. They moved into their three-bedroomed flat in 1967 when their old tenement in Springburn was blown down during storms. They were rehoused by Glasgow district council and they have lived there ever since. Under the Government's proposals, they will have reason to fear the knock on the door. If it is in the middle

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1197</span>
of the night, they may suspect that it is the Minister, but if it is during the day it is likely to be the rent officer. They have good reason to fear a visit from the rent officer because he will look at their circumstances—a husband and wife living in a three-bedroomed flat—and judge, by an unspecified test which the Minister has not yet explained to the Committee, that they are over-accommodated. Their housing benefit will therefore be cut because the Government have cut the grant to Glasgow district council, forcing the council to cut the housing benefit to my parents and compelling them to move out of the house where they have lived for 17 years. It is their family home and I go to visit them there. Why should they be forced into smaller accommodation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the implications of the Bill. It is time that the Minister answered specific questions about what will happen to people like by parents who will be forced out of their homes by the measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's parents need have no fear of a knock at the door. They will have a registered rent, so the new arrangements will not apply. People at income support level will receive 100 per cent, of the rent that is accepted for housing benefit purposes, whether the tenancy is regulated or assured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new capital rules will benefit pensioners with small savings. At present, income generated by savings is taken into account. In future, capital of less than £3,000 and any income generated from it will be disregarded. Any fundamental change to the scheme will produce gainers and losers. About half of those pensioners on income-related benefits will gain under the new scheme. The half who will lose are generally those who are better off. Housing benefit should, first and foremost, help the poorest and most vulnerable in our society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>1 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was an utterly disgraceful reply. The Minister knows that the provisions will cause considerable hardship to many tenants, especially combined with the other aspects of the Bill. He has failed to respond to the points that we raised about the diverse duties of the rent officer, who will be assessing fair rents for people with secure tenancies on the one hand and on the other acting as a policeman and restricting people's eligibility to housing benefit if they have insecure tenancies. The comparison is stark. It illustrates the gross unfairness of the position into which people are being forced by the Government. I do not intend to withdraw the amendment. We shall force it to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to get this absolutely clear. Is the Minister saying that people on income support living in public sector premises will not be affected by the rent officer's ability to judge whether they are over-accommodated?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, in the circumstances which the hon. Gentleman described, I am concerned that tenants are not over-accommodated. That is my view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1198</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want a view. I want an answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that people at income support level will get 100 per cent, of the rent which is accepted for housing benefit purposes, whether the tenancies are regulated or assured.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is not answering the question. I asked about the rent officer's role of judging whether housing benefit claimants are over-accommodated. Will people on income support who are living in district council houses be subjected to the rent officer's inquiries as to whether they are over-accommodated, and if so, will they have their housing benefit cut?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is missing the point. The provision will not affect regulated tenancies or existing tenancies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So the measure applies only to assured tenancies, not to the public sector?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right. I am glad to be able to reassure the hon. Gentleman about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But there is the other side of that coin. The Minister has provided a powerful argument for people to remain in public sector tenancies and not move into the unkown and dangerous water of the Government's proposals. He has shown that people in insecure tenancies will be in difficulty, especially if they are on low incomes. That is one of the reasons why I shall press,the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

a general principle the Government do not believe that housing benefit should enable people to occupy accommodation which is too large for their needs. The cases that the arrangements are designed to cover are those in which people deliberately rent accommodation that is too large or otherwise inappropriate for them because they believe that the housing benefit system will pick up the tab.

The impact of the new arrangements on the sort of cases that the hon. Gentleman has in mind is currently being examined by the working parties to which I have referred. I assure hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the Government have considered giving rights to local authorities to appeal against a rent officer's determination and to make representations based on their knowledge of local circumstances and needs.

That is why a formal right of appeal would not be appropriate. However, I accept that the new arrangements could mean that local authorities lose subsidy in such circumstances.

The amendment seeks to correct an error which occurred when Scottish Housing Acts were consolidated last year.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would remove the present restriction in sections 3 and 18 of the New Towns (Scotland) Act 1968 that sales of land may be made only for the laying out and development of a new town. We believe that that restriction of purpose is an unnecessary and outdated constraint on corporations' attempts to develop diversity in the housing tenure pattern in their maturing communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We envisage that development corpoprations' main use of this new power will be to sell small groups of houses throughout the areas of the new towns. The corporations will be able to consider schemes where housing associations or co-operatives, private sector developers or other landlords are interested, but corporations will have to secure the consent of my honourable and learned Secretary of State to any proposed sale. My right honourable and learned Friend will provide guidance to corporations on how this power may be exercised and on the nature of the conditions which he would expect to attach to any sale. I should make it quite clear again today, as I did during debate on new clause 1, that these proposals are designed to expand still further the range of options available to new town residents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also assure the Committee that the views and wishes of tenants will be respected and that no tenant will be compelled against his or her will to transfer to another landlord in advance of wind-up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is unacceptable. Perhaps the best way to discover more about it is to ask the Minister some questions. I can find no reference to the sale of houses. The new clause refers to land, although I realise that houses on such land will be covered by the provision. Will the houses to be sold be only those that are vacant, or could they include houses that are tenanted? How will the provision reduce the growing waiting lists that are beginning to worry so many people in the new towns? It will not create one
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1206</span>
additional house. How will section 6(1) approvals be affected?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the extended power would enable corporations to sell land and houses to tenants and landlords, including housing associations and tenants' co-operatives, thereby increasing the scope of diversification and innovation of housing tenure in new towns. That almost mirrors what he said earlier. What sort of tenants and landlords does the Minister have in mind other than housing associations and tenant co-operatives?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Tenanted houses may be sold, subject to the tenants' agreement.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked whether section 6(1) approvals will apply under the new clause, or will it do away with the need for those approvals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>NO CHARGE ON CREATION OF ASSURED TENANCY</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>"it shall be unlawful for a premium to be charged to a tenant prior to or on creation of an assured tenancy, save that a deposit not exceeding one month's rent may be charged.".—	<i>[Mr Kirkwood.]</i></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause seeks to stop key money being charged when a tenancy is created. We discussed that matter earlier. If there were a balance of supply and demand in the private rented sector, landlords would be unable to charge a premium, but there are substantial worries about premiums and I should be interested to hear what the Minister has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) has presented his case well. The new clause would not achieve its aim as it does not define a premium, nor
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1208</span>
does it specify the consequences for a landlord who seeks to impose one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is more important to consider whether premiums have a place in the assured tenancy arrangements. One of the main factors encouraging landlords to charge premiums has been the existence of rent control, which has denied landlords the full market rent for their property. Some have tried to achieve a total income equivalent to what they would get on the open market by imposing a premium. That justification will not carry as much weight when the assured tenancy arrangements are in operation. The landlord will be entitled to receive the market rent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our decision not to continue the prohibition on premiums rested on that argument. We believe that premiums, like rents, should be left to the market to determine. As our policy comes to fruition and the supply of accommodation for private renting increases, landlords who seek premiums will be unable to let their property in competition with other—less greedy landlords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware of the arguments for continuing prohibition of premiums, especially for short assured tenancies, and I shall consider the points that have been made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to hear that the Minister still has an open mind on the matter. He cannot escape the fact that such abuse will be extended. Housing to let will be a seller's market in Scotland for the foreseeable future and it is feared that landlords will take advantage of the desperation of prospective tenants by imposing key money or premiums.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire is entitled to draw attention to that abuse. The Minister cannot be complacement. It is already a feature in rented tenancies in Scotland and we fear that it will worsen unless there is some control. The Minister says that the market will protect tenants from that abuse, but that is self-evidently untrue. The market conditions that will prevail will give landlords every incentive to try to get an extra pound of flesh from tenants. I am glad that the Minister is at least prepared to consider the matter further, and we may return to it at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's answer was unsatisfactory. I agree with the hon. Member for East Lothian that there will be far-reaching ramifications and implications if premiums are not made unlawful. There are implications for the housing benefit system as they may need to be considered when deciding on the amount of benefit. That is not a satisfactory way to proceed, but if people are charged key money, they should be able to claim housing benefit to cover it. Otherwise, people receiving benefits will be denied access to some properties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that market forces will sort that out, but they will not. There has been a long history of prohibition of key money and it has worked well, so it would be a retrograde step if that prohibition were removed. Like the hon. Member for East Lothian, I hope that the Minister has not completely closed his mind, that he will remain willing and

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause stands alone and is self-explanatory. At present, the legal costs of council house sales are charged to housing revenue accounts, which means that tenants effectively pay the costs in their rents. I believe that that is unfair. I do not know whether the provision was devised when the system was set up. I feel that the costs should be met by the community through general taxation, and new clause 3 provides for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with interest to the hon. Gentleman's argument in favour of new clause 3, which seeks to prevent a local authority from charging to the housing revenue account costs incurred in selling houses under this part of the Bill or under the right to buy legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not satisfied that any change would be an improvement on the present system, or that many local authorities seek such a change on the basis of their experience in operating the right to buy legilsation. The administrative costs of sale are substantially exceeded by the value of receipts generated by the sales, which can be used, for example, to finance modernisation of the authority's remaining stock without increasing its loan debt, or can be applied directly to reduce the authority's total outstanding debt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The remaining tenants gain advantage by the application of the receipts to the housing revenue account. It is entirely reasonable that the account which benefits from those receipts should meet the much lower costs of the transactions. The arrangement for charging administration costs on right to buy sales to the housing revenue account has operated without difficulty to date and I do not see that the arrangement to cover tenants' choice sales under the provisions of the Bill will create difficulties.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Constituency experience has caused me some anxiety—the same situation must obtain in other parts of Scotland—about former tenants of the Scottish Special Housing Association who purchased their properties from the SSHA under tenants' right to buy. When the areas were originally feued and acquired by the SSHA it was on the basis that they would be let property, and not for general sale. One of the consequences was that schemes were laid out in a way that left large areas of common amenity ground spread across the length and breadth of the feu plots that made up the schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of these SSHA houses are now being sold. In my constituency that is true in Hawick and in parts of Kelso and Jedburgh. The former tenants of the SSHA who are now owner-occupiers are being charged for the costs of upkeep of the common amenity grounds. There is no legal complaint because the SSHA, quite properly, entered into the deeds of conditions attaching to the few dispositions offered in the course of sale to the former tenants a clause expressly laying upon the new owners the duty and liability to maintain the common parts, privileges and pertinents surrounding the schemes, although in some of the deed of conditions, the clause "in so far as not taken over by the local authority" was also inserted. Even some of the legal agents advising on the sale were telling former tenants and prospective purchasers that liability for the upkeep of the amenity areas in the SSHA schemes would ultimately be taken over by local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
1.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chickens have now come home to roost, because the SSHA feels obliged to levey charges in fulfilment of the opportunities contained in the deed of conditions for the upkeep of the common areas. The charges were first levied a year or so ago. The SSHA had tried to levy them the previous year but met tremendous resistance and decided that the amounts of money that it was seeking to collect made the game not worth the candle, so it withdrew the original bills for the amenity charges on the new owner-occupiers. Quite large bills are now coming through the letterboxes in SSHA housing schemes, relating to plots of ground often hundreds of yards
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0744">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1211</span>
remote from the houses. These bills can increase year on year without reference to the owner-occupiers who have to pay them without any forewarning of annual increases. To rub salt in the wound, the contracts for the work have been so placed that in some cases the work is not undertaken at all, or if it is, the work is unsatisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise for detaining the Committee at this time of night, but there is a device available to the SSHA and the local authorities which would produce a perfectly fair and equitable solution. It is enshrined in new clause 4 and would mean that the local authorities would receive a capitalised sum to take over the liability for maintenance. Any dispute about the sum necessary could be referred to the district valuer. Such a lump sum would make it possible for the local authority to take over the upkeep and maintenance of the common areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Former tenants who purchased their homes from local authorities sometimes live cheek by jowl with SSHA former tenants, yet the local authority tenants automatically have their common ground amenity charges met by the rated expenditure and the work is done by local authority. An anomaly arises because occupiers can be paying £50 or £60 per year in amenity charges for plots of ground that give them no real advantage, while their next door neighbours who happen to have acquired their houses from the local authority pay nothing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be extremely remiss of the Government not to take the opportunity presented by the Bill to sort out the anomaly and get some equity and justice for owners who are former tenants of the SSHA . Their case has been well made, and there has been lengthy correspondence about it. The legal validity of the charges has been tested in the courts. The Minister should consider seriously the proposal in new clause 4. So far as I can judge, it is a legal and technically valid solution to a difficult problem which is causing heartache to constitutents throughout Scotland. I hope that the Minister will respond positively to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new clause is momentous. I have come across similar problems about the takeover of footpaths and gardens on private estates, but not in connection with SSHA estates and amenities. I am grateful to the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood).

The present arrangements whereby the SSHA arranges for the maintenance of common ground adjacent to dwelling houses and subsequently bills former tenants for their share of the cost has caused some criticism from owners, as the hon. Gentleman said. The relevant condition is clearly set out in the SSHA house sale agreement, so there is no question of a condition being imposed after sale.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1212</span>
Futhermore, the practice followed by the association is equitable in that it provides for a contribution to the maintenance of open spaces and amenity ground in a given estate from tenants and owners alike.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The association, faced with anxieties about the levels of maintenance charges, has considered alternative arrangements. Thus, proposals similar to the effect of new clause 4 have been discussed with local authorities, for example through COSLA. It has not been possible so far to identify a general formula for a transfer price which the association considers reasonable. Meanwhile, the SSHA is discussing with some authorities the possibility of a mutually acceptable transfer. The hon. Gentleman's new clause is unnecessary. The framework is already available so that discussions can be held between SSHA and individual authorities to reach agreement about the maintenance of open spaces. For that reason, I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to detain the Committee again, but I shall be brief. I have been in contact with Scottish Women's Aid since the time when I was a

solicitor. I had dealings with the battered wives' refuge at Jedburgh—I am pleased that it was in a professional capacity rather than in any other capacity—which does good work. The figures resulting from the survey that it carried out with the local authorities were distressing. Six out of the 15 local authorities which were surveyed would not consider as homeless those battered women who had not obtained orders under the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981. Four local authorities even went so far as to insist that women use orders obtained under that Act instead of homelessness legislation even when a woman knows that that would put herself and her children at risk. When a woman refuses to use the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981, she is classed as intentionally homeless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, those local authorities are using one piece of legislation to defeat another and denying abused women the chance of safety which both pieces of legislation were set up to afford. If the results of that survey are borne out in evidence, the Committee should be concerned about the problem. New clauses 8 and 9 and, to some extent, new clause 14 would assist in solving the difficulty. If they are technically deficient in any way, I hope that the Minister will consider the spirit behind them and explain what the Government believe should be done to deal with homelessness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to support the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr Kirkwood). Like him, I have had a great deal of professional experience of the problems of battered wives. I welcomed the provisions of the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981, but it contains many gaps. There are also problems in the homeless persons legislation, which is now consolidated in the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987. It strikes me that the more pressure that is put on local authorities by such measures and by others that the Government can apply, especially financial ones, the more homelessness will be created because local authorities will find it more difficult to meet their statutory obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the past 10 years, the local authorities' attempted definition of intentional homelessness has expanded. Battered wives are covered both by the original homeless persons legislation and by the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981. They are a vulnerable group of people for which special provision should be made. Fairly complex provisions were made in the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981, which proved difficult for the courts. There remain many practical problems in protecting women.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 8 seeks specifically to remove the requirement for a homeless classification that the violence should have been committed by a person residing in the household. In practice, that would not cover all cases. Many women who have managed to escape from a violent home continue to be persecuted by their spouse or co-habitee. I know of several cases
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0746">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1215</span>
where the only solution has been for the woman to put herself in a protective environment such as a battered wives hostel or literally to hide. That is a terrible thing. The new clause is humane. Two or three years ago I dealt with a case in which the husband chased his wife and whenever he found her he did not knock at the door but simply smashed in the windows. That woman found that she could not escape. Technically the local authority had no obligaion to house her. She eventually went to a battered wives hostel at the other end of the country, taking her children away from their home, their schools and the environment in which they had grown up. Women need protection and although humane measures exist, there are gaps.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other new clauses make sense, too, especially new clause 9. Local authorities will be pressured into taking a more restrictive view as they will not have the facilities and accommodation available. That would be a retrograde step. I have no special knowledge of the Scottish Women's Aid survey, but I know about the difficulty of finding housing for vulnerable women especially those with children. Many of them have to go through all sorts of tests before they can be housed by the local authority. Local authorities often insist that interdicts and so on should be obtained. There are practical reasons why iterdicts and exclusion orders under the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981 cannot be obtained. For example, not every woman knows where the man is—he may be able to find her, but she cannot find him. To be effective, the orders have to be served on the man, and it is not always possible to do that. We often have to deal with people who will not accept a court order and see it as no more than piece of paper. The unfortunate women need protection. The new clauses still do not go all the way and I would support a thorough-going review of the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I associate myself with the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) and of the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood). The existing legislation is not working as Parliament intended, partly because of the difficult circumstances faced by local authorities. They do not have sufficient housing stock to meet the need. Inevitably, cases of homelessness are becoming more extreme. The Committee is right to contemplate the serious and dangerous circumstances that face a significant minority of women who are entitled to be protected by society and by Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate has been useful. I have examined the terms of the new clauses carefully and listened closely to what has been said. I appreciate the difficulties that occur when people fear so much for their safety that they are unable to continue residence in the family home. The hon. Member for Aberdeen. South (Mr. Doran) gave the example of the husband who threw bricks through the window, placing his wife in a state of great alarm. The present legislation would allow a person to be categorised as homeless if fear of violence came from the actions of someone resident in the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1216</span>
accommodation in question. The intention of new clause 8 is to remove the occupany proviso. The new clause would cover a situation in which the spouse was unwilling to risk returning to or remaining in the family home because of her fear of violence from her partner who might not at that time be resident in the home. I fear, however that the wording is wide enough to require persons living in an area where the general level of violent activity was high to be classed as homeless and therefore to be rehoused by the authority in a different, perhaps better area. I do not believe that that is intended and it is certainly not practical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister refers to the general level of violent activity being high. What on earth is going on?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman probably knows, as he is a lawyer. Certainly my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) is an expert on such matters. In some areas the level of violence is high. For example at night time in central park in New York one is liable to come up against drug addicts who may be ill disposed towards one. It is a general comment. For those reasons, I cannot accept clause 8.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that bypassing the provisions of the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981 as new clause 9 seeks to do would serve a useful purpose. The provisions of that Act allow a spouse or co-habitee to apply for a court order declaring occupancy rights, restricting the occupancy rights of the non-applicant spouse or even excluding occupancy by the non-applicant. Those provisions should be tried first. Then should not be rejected too easily. I fear that that would happen if we accepted new clause 9.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has long been suggested in some quarters that there should be an appeal on the matters raised by new clause 14. The Government remain of the view that such appeals would not be appropriate. Given the introduction some years ago of the judicial review procedure in the Court of Session, there is now a quick and effective remedy if a local authority has acted illegally Therefore, I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the new clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is sympathetic to what new clause 9 seeks to achieve, and he dismissed it for a valid reason. I should have thought that it was not outwith the competence of the draftsmen to word the provisions more tightly, although that is perhaps not borne out by some of the drafting in the Bill. I accept what the Minister has said, but the Bill could include a clearer definition of the "other person" mentioned in section 24 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987. For example, if the definition was restricted to a spouse, former spouse or former co-habitee, that would cover the Minister's point and his sympathy could be turned into something more durable. I appreciate that the Minister would not want to do that immediately, but if he agrees with the principle it should not be difficult to find the words to narrow

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that it is in order for a non-lawyer to move a new clause. As a mere farmer, I commend this new clause, which has been suggested by the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations to enable housing associations to allocate houses on the basis of need and without prejudice to voluntary committee members, officers or employees, or indeed, their close relatives. Housing associations would then be allowed to purchase property at the district valuer's valuation from voluntary committee members, officers or employees, or their close relatives which could be improved using housing association grants without fear of implications that it is a benefit to those individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the SFHA has been making representations to the Government on that issue for seven years. Some minor relaxations in the rules
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1218</span>
relating to the granting of benefit or making payment to a committee member, officer or employee of the housing association have been made, but only in relation to designated community-based housing associations. The SFHA maintains that the granting of a tenancy should be exempt from the legislation relating to the granting of a benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is faced by all types of housing associations, whether they are community based, locally based, housing co-operatives, the staff of housing associations and, most particularly, special needs housing associations. The Minister will remember that I referred to a constituent who is the mother of two young men who suffer from schizophrenia. She is a member of the National Schizophrenia Fellowship and, with her deep knowledge of that affliction is a committee member of the Ark housing association which provides for the special needs of mentally handicapped and mentally ill people. She can bring expertise to bear on the management of housing for such people, but because she is a member of the committee of that housing association her sons cannot become tenants because that would be regarded as her receiving benefit from the housing association of which she is a member. That is grossly unfair. It is right for people who have such an intimate knowledge of special needs housing to give their expertise to the management of housing associations, but it is diabolical that they are unable to receive the benefit of such housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That problem is relevant here and has been drawn to the Government's attention over a period of years by the SFHA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are important new clauses and I am aware of the continuing debate on the granting of benefits. It is not a simple issue. The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) wrote to me about it in the summer. The existing controls were introduced in 1980 in response to pressure from the Public Accounts Committee which was anxious about abuse in housing associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We appreciate that the matter can cause difficulties in some instances, but a balance must be struck. We have already sought to strike such a balance though the relaxation in the restriction that was made in the Housing (Scotland) Act 1986. Section 14 of that Act, which new clause 12 seeks to delete, allows tenancies to be granted to and houses purchased from committee members and their close relatives in respect of community-based housing associations. There is room for further consideration about whether the balance has been currently struck.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

Now that the Committree has reached its ish—I think that that is the appropriate term—I should like to associate myself with the thanks offered by the Minister to you, to your colleague Mr. Lambie, to the Clerk and to the 	<i>Hansard</i> writers who have managed to cope with our dialects and place names, albeit with a little prompting from time to time. In particular, I thank the advisers from Shelter and the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations. To their credit, they are still with us at almost half-past two in the morning. They have served hon. Members on both sides of the Committee extremely well, as have the advisers from the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, the Scottish Council for Single Homeless and others.

At this stage of our deliberations I shall refrain from commenting on the conduct of the Government, the Minister or his colleagues from Scotland and elsewhere. As he well knows, he has no mandate for this experiment and the measure is bitterly resented in Scotland.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1221</span>
Finally, I offer my sincere thanks to my hon. Friends, most of whom had little experience of the proceedings of Standing Committees when we began our deliberations two months ago but all of whom have put up a most effective performance on behalf of their constituents and the people of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirk wood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. To make this an all-party occasion, I concur in the best legal tradition with everything that has been said by the Minister and by the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson). I believe that I am right in saying that both the Minister and the hon. Member for East Lothian have just finished Front Benching their first housing Bill together. I confess that I was surprised that the Minister's ministerial colleagues at the Scottish Office left him to deal with the whole Bill himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Their turn will come.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From that point of view, both Front Bench spokesmen have acquitted themselves extremely well for their respective parties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about Woodstock?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, why not? We also owe something to Conservative Back Benchers who live furth of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to watching the careers of both the Minister and the hon. Member for East Lothian, but
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1222</span>
I hope that I shall not have to serve with them on many other Committees at this time of night.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank all hon. Members for their remarks and I am grateful for the assistance that I have received from everyone. As hon. Members know, this is my first time in the Chair on a major Committee and I must say that I did not find it a difficult task. New Members conducted themselves very well and acted as though they were thoroughly experienced in the business of Committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Special mention should be made of the hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot) who was so gracious and good natured in the face of the remarks made about him. He had better watch out because the Committee of Selection will take note of the fact that he has been an excellent attender in the Committee and he made be adopted as an honorary Scottish member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I offer my sincere thanks to the civil servants, the 	<i>Hansard</i> writers and, in particular, to Mr. Gerhold for his advice and assistance, to the police officers and to the Sergeant at Arms. I appreciate that representatives of organisations have come down from Scotland to be with the Committee, even at this very late hour, to give us advice and assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank all of you very much and wish you a safe journey home.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
