	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [19 April],</i> No. 11, in page 1, line 8, to leave out the word "Board" and insert the word "Council".—	<i>(Mr Norman Hogg.)</i></p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 12, in page 1, line 9, leave out "Board" and insert "Council".</p>
	<p>No 13, in page 1, line 14, leave out "Board" and insert "Council".</p>

	<p>No 17, in page 1, line 23, leave out "Board" and insert "Council".</p>
	<p>I should advise the Committee at this stage that the motion on the order in which we shall debate the remainder of the Bill will be taken after all the proposed amendments to clause 1.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcom Bruce 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gordon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the end of our previous sitting, Mr. Knox, I was commenting on the speech of the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker), the hon. Gentleman seemed to be trailing a possible outcome of the Bill which I do not believe to be the Government's intention—that it might lead to a two-tier system. I do not suggest that the hon. Gentleman argued in favour of that, but it could take us back to the era of junior secondary schools. Groups of parents who wished to take academic pressure off rather than put it on could take over schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall explain my position clearly to the hon. Gentleman. I was telling the Committee that where most children when they leave school at 18, cannot be adjudged academics that would also be true of most parents. It would not surprise me if that balance were reflected in the composition of the boards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has confirmed the dilemma within education policy. The question is whether parents should be in full control—the Bill is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
leading towards that goal—or whether we recoginise that education authorities and educationists should have a strong if not dominant view, so as to maximise opportunities and ensure that curriculum development and pace takes account of a wide range of abilities. I am not convinced, even if the hon. Member for Tayside, North is, that parents will always have similar priorities. The system could lead to a distortion, which would be a retrograde step.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment attempts to change the names of the proposed boards back to councils. It is argued that "council" would be a bad name because school councils had not worked. It is extraordinary to suggest that although people do not understand or like councils they like boards. The semantic argument does not stand up to close examination. School councils are established in many parts of the country, but their performance is patchy. In my area, Grampian region, school councils have generally been a success. Most schools have them and participation is positive. The relationship between school councils, school staff and the education authority is positive, constructive, dynamic and helpful. Those councils could develop more powers, but that is a different prospect from the idea that, having come this far, they should be swept away in favour of a system that parents in the area have universally said that they do not want. Only a tiny fraction—fewer than 10 out of hundreds of my constituents who have made representations—says that it wants the powers that the Government are anxious to give parants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Experience in other constituencies may differ. In my constituency there is a willingness to be involved in school boards. Indeed, parents are having meetings. There will be a meeting on the subject in the coming week in Blairgowrie.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is different argument from the one that I am advancing. The Government are determined to push the Bill through and school boards will be created. There is no doubt that in my area, where school councils have been successful, many of those who now participate in school councils will participate in school boards. But that should not be taken as a sign that they wanted or welcomed the measure. They made it clear they did not. In response to the sedentary remarks of Labour Members I acknowledge that school councils have not been universally successful. Even in the Grampian region they are not perfect, and in some parts of the country they are nonexistent, as it were, or have been ineffective or disruptive. Other members of the Committee may have more experience than I, and may wish to say so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of those who have been actively involved in school councils, parent-teacher associations or similar bodies with some degree of success have put the argument to me forcefully that areas where there has been success should be examined to discover the reason for their success. That success should then be built on and spread to areas where such schemes have been less successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Instead, the Government have chosen to come forward with an alien concept, which the consultation process showed was unwelcome and unwanted. I am
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0777">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>43</span>
trying to help the Minister, to keep on track with what his party promised the people of Scotland at the last general election. He may not have made such promises but the Secretary of State certainly did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parlimentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It emerged clearly from the consultation process that few people were worried about what the body should be called, and that the vast majority accepted the principle of having one body per school. That differs greatly from the council structure. As the hon. Gentleman is arguing about the name, will he square what he is saying with the result of the consultation process?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the overwhelming majority of representations favoured one body per school. Indeed, I can testify that in my area there has been a call for one council per school for some time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument about the name may be only a matter of description. Given the fierceness with which the proposals were contested, I cannot imagine that many people thought that the name was central to the argument. However, the Minister should assume that people were not worried about it. The hon. Member for Kindcardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) will testify—he is on record as having said so—that the Government specifically stated several times in writing that they wanted to reform school councils. Most people assumed that that meant that school councils would continue to exist. One of the reforms which most would support is to have one council per school, with the proviso of an allowance for groupings of schools such as feeder primary schools. It is in their interest to make a contribution, following the old college council model, to developments within the secondary school to which the children will eventually go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, I said that the Secretary of State wrote to me and made it clear that the Government wanted to reform school councils and that, to trail a forward debate, there was no question of opting out being considered for Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about Jordanhill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I discussed Jordanhill on Second Reading, but shall not go down that avenue now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says from a sedentary position that I am wrong. But the parents of Jordanhill wanted to opt in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is wandering rather far away from the fairly narrow confines of the present amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) is being his usual provacative self—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am not here to defend
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
anyone, but the hon. Gentleman started it off, so perhaps he can finish it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that point when it is relevant, Mr. Knox.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is relevant that the Secretary of State said that school councils would be reformed. He told me to deal with the Conservative manifesto for Scotland rather than the manifesto for England, which is irrelevant to Scotland, and developments begin to show the truth of that. The Scottish manifesto made it clear that the proposal was for a major reform of school councils, and I do not believe that changing the name to "boards", never mind the proposals contained in this Bill, accords with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Queen's Speech should have some authority in the House of Commons, but I think that we have learnt over the years that it is a ritual that means very little. It certainly does not bind the Government to anything—either in implementing what is in it or in introducing things that were never trailed in it. However, the Queen's Speech specifically stated:
	<br><q><p>"Measures will be introduced to strengthen schools councils in Scotland and to improve the management of Scottish education."</p></q>
The overwhelming majority of parents in Scotland, in my area and others, would say, "Here, here, we all agree with that. We all welcome that and are interested in it." It is not, however, reasonable for the Government to suggest that what is being proposed in the Bill, and the proposed name, accords with what they promised. I am trying to help the Minister to fulfill his promise, to the electroate of Scotland and to this House, that was made by Her Majesty only a few months ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not think that Her Majesty makes promises to the House of Commons. The hon. Gentleman must be rather more careful in his use of language in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Her Majesty nevertheless laid before the House proposals on behalf of her Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Her Majesty did not lay them before the House. The hon. Gentleman must be very careful. The Queen's Speech does not involve a commitment by the Queen to the provisions within it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. Knox. The point that I am sure you can accept is that the Queen's Speech represents the programme of her Government, and the Government made a clear commitment in that speech that they would reform schools councils. What is being proposed in this Bill is a significant departure from that. The name, which is what we are debating under this amendment, is a relevant component of that promise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take your guidance, Mr. Knox but the Government have gravely misled the House in terms of what was promised and what is now being put before this Committee. The amendment is relevant and proper and it should be taken seriously. The Government are not entitled to argue that their proposal relates in any way to the consultation or the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0778">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>45</span>
promises made before or after the general election to the electorate or to the House. They are departing from all those promises, regardless of the views that were expressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The term "school boards" was not challenged because that which was put forward represented such a radical departure that attention was rightly directed to the meat of the proposals. To that extent, the Government have succeeded in persuading wiser heads than the Minister's that it would be foolish to proceed with the proposals against the clear and overwhelming opposition of parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change of name that is proposed in this amendment is relevant. The term "school council" has become understood, but school councils can certainly be improved. Many of those who have been involved in school councils have said that they were interested in getting more power and more authority, but that could have been done by amending the existing legislation in a fairly minor way to require local authorities to ensure that the powers that were enabled were taken up. It would not have detained the House or a Committee for very long to introduce such an amendment, and I think that that is what most people thought the Government intended when they first raised this issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sadly, the Government are not terribly interested in what the people—or, indeed, the parents in Scotland think. They are more than happy to find the odd person who will support their proposals, but to the Conservative party in Scotland, consultation and the democratic process are a matter of finding the oddball people who support their position and treating them as if they represent the overwhelming majority. The Minister knows that reform of school councils was what was promised. The term "school council" is understood, and that is what people want and expect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) is straining matters a little over a name when he says that the Governemt have misled the House. He spoils his argument by rather extravagant language. My feelings about the original proposal are well known and are not far different from those of the hon. Gentleman. Whatever our feelings it does the Committee no good to discuss the consultation process because it was thorough, and the Government responded. Opposition Members cannot have it both ways. The consultation process was the best that I have known under the Government, and has brought results. I am grateful for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter of the name of these bodies is not fundamental. Whatever happens, people become accustomed to one name or another. However, I wish to put on record that I sympathise with the ideas behind the amendment. Under the original proposals for ceiling and executive powers, a change of name was appropriate. The term "board" for a body with executive powers was probably more appropriate than "council". However, the Government have responded to the consultation process and returned to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
a more consultative organisation which is more in line with what I want because it builds on the existing school council structure. Therefore, the term "council" is more appropriate than "board".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In contrast with the experience of numerous other hon. Members, school councils in my constituency have generally, operated successfully. The Bill introduces an improvement and we should build on what we have. The Bill will maintain the continuity of successful school councils, and in the circumstances the term "council" is better than "board".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Names are not everything, and more critical issues will be discussed, but the amendment is relevant. Even if my hon. Friend the Minister is minded to retain what is in the Bill, he may wish to consider whether the term "councils" better describes the functions of the bodies that will be set up than the term "boards". I have much sympathy with remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) on Tuesday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Members have said that this is not the key issue in the Bill, but is sets the tone for the ensuing debate. The Bill is alien to much of what is happening in the educational culture of Scotland. The use of the term "board" is significant for that reason, and because the hidden agenda of the debate is about opting out, comparisons with private schools and an attempt to take us back to the thinking of the earlier part of the century. The terminology is significant which is why, in your eyes, Mr. Knox, Labour Members may be making the proverbial meal out of an issue which has implications for the general discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The term "board" is not rooted in the modern culture of education in Scotland. The Minister must say why he wishes to take a word such as "council" out of education vocabulary and replace it with "board".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is well aware that the main church in Scotland is the Church of Scotland and is run by cogressional boards, which are elected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To be fair to myself, I must say that I have not touched upon the issue of election versus appointments. I shall come to that, so perhaps the hon. Gentleman will hold further fire until we reach that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg (Cumberanuld and Kilsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee should not be misled about how the Church of Scotland is administered. It is administered by ruling elders meeting in kirk sessions, presbyteries which cover the areas, and in the general assembly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And senates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And senates. I have never heard of a congressional board. It must be a peculiarity of Blairgowrie.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his intervention. My agnosticism does not stretch to the wider knowledge of many hon. Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0779">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend could always ask a Knox.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Terminology is important. The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) referred to elections. It is widely assumed that the term "councils" in Scotland refers to district and regional councils and a few other councils which are elected. The term "board" smacks of appointees. The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), and the Government may have a new interest in deomocracy, but having an appointed board would be unfair and would not lie with what they are trying to achieve. In this debate we should not be talking about boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried also about the shift of emphasis away from a publicly-funded service, which is widely regarded by parents in Scotland, to one which draws upon the characteristics of private education. The Government would like us to adopt the characteristics of private education before the substance is developed over the next two or three years. The use of the term "board" highlights that anxiety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our obvious dilemma is that if the Government were honest about this school boards proposal they would acknowledge that school councils, however patchily, have done a reasonable job in Scotland. They reflect the consensus on parental involvement. There is a clear political consensus of parents and education authorities. Why are the Government deliberately being provocative in the substance of the Bill and in the terminology in which they dress it up?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No Government in the past would have implemented measures that are alien to the general thrust of education philosophy and reinforce that alienation by shifting the debate by using the term "board" and not "council". I hope that the Minister will take seriously the comments of my hon. Friends and Conservative Members. He is a fair-minded man, so he will want to adopt this amendment, show good faith and illustrate that ideology allows him to make this conecession. If he does so, it will reassure us that our travails over the next few weeks may be more rewarding than we currently anticipate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like right hon. and hon. Members, I do not regard the change of name to school boards as a fundamental matter, but there are good reasons for a change of name from school councils. Although school councils have existed for some time, they have never had the character, at least in Strathclyde, of having one council per school. Therefore, the school board system is significantly different from the present arrangements in that it is clearly a fundamental aspect of the new system that there will be one body per school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
School boards will have functions that school councils have not undertaken. I shall give the Committee an example from my constituency. The parents of pupils at Neilston primary school are currently hoping to take a case of maladministration against Strathclyde regional council which has failed, over a significant period—at least since the late 1970s

—to make any provision for the steady build-up of population in Neilston which, as the planning authority, it knew about. As a consequency of that, and of the complete failure to take action, there is now a crisis in Neilston. The population is continuing to increase because of housing developments and there is insufficient room at the primary school. Therefore, the authority has proposed to bus pupils of Neilston school to Barrhead. That has caused much anxiety in the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that I wish to make is that although there are school councils throughout Strathclyde, in practice they have had no influence on the problem at Neilston. If a system of school boards had been in place, under clause 10—which we shall come to later—the school board would have had the right to seek information from the authority about the school and about the provision of education in the authority area. The school board could have gone to Strathclyde to ask what it intended to do about the steady build-up of pupil population in Neilston.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend will tell me, but I understand that the regional council has referred down to school councils the final decision about re-zoning, as a consequence of population changes and movement. Therefore, I am surprised at what the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) said about the school in his constituency. I understood that it was the clear policy of the regional council to give that level of decision-making to the school councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was referring to the problems that have been allowed to develop over a long period and have resulted in a crisis, not to re-zoning. Something must be done. As the hon. Gentleman knows, although I have criticised some of Strathclyde region's plans to reorganise schools, I have consistently argued that the region is right to face the general problem of over-provision of school facilities. However, in Neilston the problem is not over-provision but a crisis that has arisen out of a failure to add, for example extra classrooms—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that if the school board system had been in operation, the authority would have addressed the problems that have arisen in Neilston earlier. That is because the parents would have had a clear mechanism to put pressure on the authority.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I must answer some of the issues raised by the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart). He may correct me if I am wrong, but he must be the same hon. Member for Eastwood who was once responsible for Education as an Under-Secretary for State for Scotland. I was under the impression that such Ministers set the capital expenditure limits for all regional councils. Certainly, Strathclyde has faced the problem for some time that its capital expenditure limits make it difficult to meet all the requirements that are visited upon it. If the population of Neilston and the hon. Member for Eastwood are unhappy, there is a grave danger that he will shoot himself in the foot, because any charge of maladministration is bound to—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall do so effortlessly, Mr. Knox. The hon. Member for Eastwood cast the aspersion that it was not possible for a school council to make representations to the regional council or to the Minister about levels of capital expenditure. That is sheer fiction. I have repeatedly attended meetings of school councils, and every meeting has been punctuated with requests to write to the regional council to make representations. Each reply states that the region will do what it can for the local authority within the limits of capital resources, so the power to seek information is not new. I listened with interest to the hon. Member for Eastwood, but could not detect how the powers of the new proposed school boards will differ from those under the school council system.

There are imperfections in the school council system, which are largely due to flaws in the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. Our forebears must have realised that the large regional councils that were being set up needed an intermediary body—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Labour Government of the late 1970s wisely set up the investigation that led to the production of the Macbeth report of school councils. The present Government's response to that significant document was strange in the light of the importance now attributed to parental involvement. The Government are supposed to be keen to help school councils develop, and although they received the report in 1980, they did nothing about it until 1984. That must be some type of record for dilatoriness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that although our documentation includes everything except back copies of the 	<i>Beano,</i> we do not have the document that the Government produced in 1984 in response to the Macbeth report. After four years of struggling they produced a gnat, a one-page document, which was probably one of the hon. Member for Eastwood's dynamic efforts. There was absolute inaction when it was clear that school councils were struggling and needeed a boost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

A major reason why we should not accept the term "school boards" is that we are marching backwards, as it were into the future. Those of us with long memories know that the term "school boards" has unfortunate connotations in Scottish history because of what they signified. As the issue is important, I thought that I should look at the interesting discussions that preceded the Education (Scotland) Act 1918, which abolished school boards in Scotland. Apparently, my hon. Friend for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) was present, even then. There was certainly a Mr. Hogge present, who frequently intervened and made valuable contributions, such as that "it was a pity that the matter was being considered while there was a war on." Someone else said that he knew of no public governing body that was more out of touch with opinion in Scotland than the Education Department, and Mr Hogge said "it always has been." Those words of wisdom persist to this day. Mr. Hogge was also extremely critical of the fact that the Scots—as it was then—Education Board was still located in London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are marching back into the future. The head of the "Scottish Education Board" is now located within No. 10 Downing Street and by introducing in the Bill the concept of school boards is failing to take account of Scottish views. There are long folk memories of school boards, and they were abolished precisely because of the unfortunate experiences that occurred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a history of Scottish education I read that
	<br><q><p>"a certain Mrs. Anderson was defeated at the 1911 election in Rutherglen because she had spent £132.5.10½ on a new homecraft department for Gallowflat school… At Alloway in 1878 an influential local lady found fault with the quality of the sewing, and said so in presence of the pupils. The teacher spoke back, refused to apologise and received a month's notice."</p></q>

We do not want to go back to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised that Jordanhill was cited this morning. I thought that that would drop out of the list of examples given by the Tory party, given the present difficulties with the suspension of the head teacher for writing to a newspaper in an official capacity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone who talks to teachers about the term "school board" knows that it annoys them, because it conjures up an era of interference with teachers' professionalism to which they do not wish to return. An unfortunate consequence of school boards is that bodies such as the Educational Institute of Scotland became far too professionally self-protective. The history of that professional protectionism is most unfortunate and we must overcome it. The choice of the term "school boards" is unsympathetic. We had similar antagonism for a while with school councils in 1974–75, but they were beginning to be accepted by teachers. We should build on that, but the Minister has gone out of his way, in his customary style to antagonise those with whom we must work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The term "school boards" has another significance, from which we want to get away. It has American antecedents. A frivolous remark was made on Tuesday about the Harper Valley PTA. School boards have had an unfortunate history in the United States because of the unwarranted interference of parents with professional responsibility. They have been symbolic of the link between quality of education and the size of the cheque book of the people in that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some hon. Members have implied that names are not important, but they are. Choosing the term "school council" would show that the Government have some sensitivity and are willing to build out of the recent past, rather than run the risk that those bodies would be damaged by unfortunate connotations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Lewis Moonie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kirkcaldy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have realised what a rare and pleasant delight it must be for you, Mr. Knox, to sit here and listen to all these mellifluous Scottish voices. I am sure that you do not get such a chance very often and that you will be delighted to get another chance when we consider different aspects of Scottish education in other Bills, which the Minister will bring before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The essence of this minor amendment is what the bodies that the Bill will establish should be called. Many of the points about whether they should be called "councils" or "boards" have been well rehearsed and I do not propose to repeat them simply for the satisfaction of standing here for a few minutes. We should preserve and enshrine the term "school council" in the Bill to describe the new bodies that will be set up. Criticisms of school boards are due more to the faults of those who set them up and gave them an inadequate remittance with too great an area to cover, than to those of the councils or the council members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The term "council" is well established in Scotland to describe the work of a public body. There are
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>52</span>
regional and district councils and councillors and on a smaller level, there are school and college councils. We also have community councils those worthy bodies whose meetings I have attended as a regional councillor. I must say that I fair enjoyed myself, but with a certain amount of tongue in cheek, especially when the meetings dragged on for about three and a half hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local health councils are sadly (appointed)—rather than elected—bodies with public functions which have a useful role to play in Scottish towns. The word "councillor" is in common usage to describe a member of such a body and "councillors" are well respected—unlike many of the holders of those offices. Therefore, the term "council" would help to sustain in the public eye the links with the present system and an understanding of the role of the members involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The title of "school board" was rightly discarded by the change in the early part of this century, which, if his first contribution is to be believed, the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) can well remember. It was discarded for a good reason. The Government of the day recognised that education was far too important to society to be left to appointed, rather than elected, boards and that it was a function that should properly be discharged by a public authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) gave examples where school councils have been deficient. I sat on a school council in my area in Fife, and can give the lie to that. It was a most effective body despite the size of the area which it had to cover. I fully accept that the time has come to redefine the role of school councils and to make them smaller. However, I am quite surprised to hear Conservatives talking about smaller being best as they have overcentralised power over the past nine years like no previous Administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an opitmum size for such bodies. In the course of future debates we shall discuss whether a single school concept is appropriate in every case or whether there would not be merit in the original revision proposed for schools councils which was to link one secondary school with its feeder primaries. To my mind that is a much more attractive organisational concept and would give much more continunity to the role of council members once the councils are in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not very important whether we have "councils" or "boards" but hon. Member's on both sides of the Committee feel that the issue is important enough for them to speak in support of the amendment. I hope that the Minister will recognise that and be prepared to be flexible and consider retaining the old title rather than bringing in an unnecessary change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is an important principle and we must debate if fully. At our sitting on Tuesday the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>53</span>
hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) objected to the amendment not because he was a great supporter of the word "board" but because he thought that the term "school council" was unfortunate. He said that the term "council" was now associated in the minds of the public with a sort of politicisation. That was the basis of his objection to the amendment. The Opposition disagree. We should take some time to consider whether inherent in the term "school council" is the idea of politicisation which we all agree should be kept out of schools and education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know from experience that school councils in Tayside have not been politicised in the sense that they are party political. I referred on Tuesday to the fact that the school councils in Dundee fought a magnificent, although unsussessful, rear-guard action against the school closure programme of the then Tory administration. That was not party-politically motivated: the school councils were fighting for the continued existence of their schools. Many of the parents who participated in the school councils and who supported the councils in that campaign were members of the Conservative party and doubtless voted Conservative in the regional council elections that followed. However, that did not stop them opposing vigorously a Tory council which was trying to close down their schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tayside region now has a Labour administration and the school councils have not suddenly become its lapdogs. They carefully scrutinise every suggestion that comes from the Labour administration. Indeed, a consultative process has been undertaken by that administration to examine the provision of secondary education throughout Tayside. By no manner of means has it been given an easy ride by school councils in that area, even though some of their members are Labour supporters. School councils are essentially neutral in a party political sense although that does not stop them becoming involved in political decisions that affect their schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important for members of the Committee to accept that no one should accuse the members of any school council in Scotland of being guilty of the party political taint of using their status on school councils to gain a party political bonus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The experience in Strathclyde suggests the opposite. School councils are made up of parents and teachers who, by and large, are Labour supporters, but they are in deep conflict with the Labour administration in Strathclyde over its school closure programme. School councils on Tayside continually attack their Labour administration because of its inability to provide buildings, equipment and material of the standard that we should expect in schools in Scotland in the 1980s. To be fair, that is not the sole responsibility of the Labour administration, but is mainly the responsibility of the Minister and the Government, who control the amount of money that councils can spend on school buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I entirely reject any suggestion that "school councils" is a political term. I argue the opposite—"school boards" is the far more political term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>54</span>
I call Mr. Brian Meek in support of that argument.
As Conservative Members will know, he is an influential—some would even say leading—Conservative in Scotland. However, I suppose that that status depends on how his argument for a Scottish Assembly fares at the Scottish Conservative party conference on 12 May. Mr. Meek may not be a leading Conservative after that, because I suspect that the Scottish Conservative party still lives in the 19th century and will oppose a Scottish Assembly. I sincerely hope, from no party political menace that—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Member is not going to go too far down that road.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly not. I was only saying that I genuinely, and in a totally unpartisan manner, hope that the Conservative party will swing behind all the other parties in Scotland and support a Scottish Assembly that will have control over education and will decide whether we have school councils or boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As well as being a leading Conservative who will take part in the debate on a Scottish Assembly inside the Conservative party, Mr. Brian Meek is also a correspondent for the 	<i>Glasgow Herald.</i> I have an extract from one of his recent efforts in that newspaper, entitled:
	<br><q><p>"Power to the parents' champ".</p></q>
The parents champ in the photograph below the article is the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that article, Mr. Meek argued that the Under-Secretary of State is the parents' champ and sings a different song to the one that has been sung in education in Scotland for than 100 years which celebrates academic excellence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stirling argues that that must be changed and that we must now consider parents as consumers. "Consumers" is a funny term. Everyone is usually sympathetic to consumers, who are normally exploited by big, multinational companies. The Opposition are anxious about the use of the term, because considering parents as consumers could mean that people get the sort of education that they can afford. If they can afford a better education, they can obtain one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is slightly difficult to understand what that has to do with the words "council" or "board".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If you will allow me, Mr. Knox, I am coming to the point, which is that "school board" is a politically contentious term, as described in the article by Mr. Brian Meek. He argues in favour of a parents' majority on school boards, which is the Under-Secretary of State's major proposal in the clause. The proposal is that parents will have a permanent majority on the new board. It has been argued that a minority or an elite will take over the boards. Mr. Meek argues that:

We are being offered school boards that will be run and elected on the basis of political affiliation. That will introduce into Scottish education party politics, which, thankfully, have been absent from the system since the second world war. By calling them school boards, the Under-Secretary of State and his hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) will not follow that argument any further at this stage. If he wishes to put forward amendments at a later and more appropriate stage, no doubt he will do so, and we shall listen to them with the same interest with which we have listened to his recent remarks. However, if he would return to the fairly narrow confines of this amendment, the Committee would be obliged to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall follow your learned advice, Mr. Knox. I shall respond to the Minister's point when we debate the election of school boards.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the point of contention that the term "board" is closely associated with the ceiling powers which the Under-Secretary of State is still anxious to have imposed?

That is why the name is so important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a very fair point. It was conceded earlier by the hon. Member for Eastwood when he spoke in support of the term "school board" because he said that it signalled a dramatic and different change in Scottish education. There are serious differences inherent in these names and this is a serious debate, whether we adopt the term "school board" or stay with the concept of the school council as it is known in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At our last sitting, the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) also argued in favour of the term "school board" because of its great Scottish heritage—we invented the term way back. It has already been
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>56</span>
suggested this morning that in fact the phrase is an American import and there has been talk of a Caledonian branch of the Harper Valley PTA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the first world war, the school boards in Scotland were directly involved in political matters. My hon. Friend the Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) has given us some examples. However, he did not mention the famous case of John McLean, who was a Glasgow school teacher before and during the first world war. He was also a Scottish revolutionary who argued for an independent socialist Scotland. To this day he is something of a hero to members of all kinds of political affiliations in Scotland. He is one of the great figures in Scottish history. His local school board sacked him simply because of his policitcal point of view. He suffered imprisonment as well, which eventually killed him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. One would have to have very convoluted logic to link that to the amendment. Will the hon. Gentleman be more to the point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends are saying that I am from Dundee and am therefore convoluted by definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if we accept the Conservative argument that the term "school board" is a Scottish tradition, nevertheless it has a very negative impact in the folk memory of the Scottish people. They associate it not with appointing the kind of teachers who would be best for the school, but appointing teachers who would suit the narrow political perspective of the people on the board. That is why, in developing my argument, I mentioned John McLean who, as a teacher, was sacked by a school board for his politics. That could happen again under the proposed school boards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have already ruled on this. The hon. Gentleman must abide by the rulings of the Chair. The point that he has just been making has nothing to do with the name that we are discussing in this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very well, Mr. Knox. I shall try to follow your instructions closely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Eastwood argued that the term "board" is more appropriate because it signifies something significantly different and we should not continue to use the old term, "school council". He said that for the first time, we will have one council—or, as he put it, one board—per school in Scotland. That has widespread support. As the Under-Secretary of State has already said, there was no great feeling among those who responded to the consultative process against the idea of one board per school. Not only the Government, but the Labour party, to some extent, support the concept of one board or council per school. We shall discuss that later. However, it is not an article of faith that is written in tablets of stone, and surely it should be a matter for parents, schools and local communities to decide whether they want one board per school.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>57</span>
There has been successful grouping of schools under the schools councils system in Tayside. The secondary school and its feeder primaries act as one school council. A number of those school councils may prefer to have their own board for each school. I do not think that that would be the case in Catholic schools. They very closely identify the relationship between feeder primaries and secondary schools. They draw great strength from the grouping together of feeder primaries and secondaries and may see great dangers in the feeder primaries being separated from the main secondary school, inasmuch as education authorities that were looking for closures would find it easier to pick them off one at a time than they would if they were grouped together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that we consider the central argument about the termionlogy that we attach to the proposed changes. We shall argue the Bill clause by clause and line by line over the weeks ahead and we hope that we shall change the view of the Minister and other Conservative Members. In doing so, we have to start off on the right foot—or the left foot if that is more appropriate. That means that we must get the terminology correct and start with the name with which people in Scotland are familiar, and which demonstrates the democratic basis and nature of Scottish education and the non-political atmosphere that pervades it. Therefore, we should stick with the name "school councils" and kick out the Government suggestion for the new name—"school boards".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) mentioned that we do not want to return to the party political aspect and my hon. Friend the Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) mentioned that school boards are very much associated with the early 20th century, when they had a party-political aspect. In the past 50 or 60 years, we have moved away from that, and if the consultation paper that the Minister put out has shown anything, it has shown the broad basis of support across the social divide for public education in Scotland. We want to keep that and build on it. Politicisation must be minimised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the terminology of "school council" as opposed to "school board", the use of language is important, particularly when we think of previous Government policy on social security benefits. The Government have said that they would like to target them better. We have another word to substitute for "targetting". The Secretary of State for Social Services has said that he wants to get rid of the dependency culture. Those are eupemisms; we have another word. The use of the term "school council" is important; it is not marginal to the argument

Reference has been made this morning to the Macbeth report, which lay on the shelf of the Scottish Education Department for over six years. The author of that report wrote to Scottish newspapers about the consultation process. He said that he did not agree
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>58</span>
with the Minister's ceilling proposals. His policy laid the foundation for building on to school councils; he did not consider school councils to be failures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You made a telling point the other day Sir Hector, about "school boards" and "councils". I took your advice, and looked up the meaning of them in a school dictionary. The dictionary had no covers—I do not know whether you used it in your time Sir Hector, or whether that demonstrates the state of education today—but the definition that I found hit what you said spot on. It said that people were appointed to a board but elected to a council and, furthermore, that they were elected to discuss and to become involved. That aspect of school councils reflects the community dimension of schools today which we must build up. The use of the term "school boards" does not enlarge but narrows the approach to education. That aspect is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) stated that the consultative process was very successful. I think that it was successful to the surprise, and possibly dismay, of the Minister who did not expect so many responses. The 7,600 responses drove at the meat of the proposals. People in Scotland were afraid that education would be substantially changed without the broad consent of the individuals involved. They were scared about the fragmentation of educational provision which is promoted by the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want educational coherence. School councils will build on that. They will provide the coherence between the local education authority, which plays an important role in public education, and individual and feeder schools in the community. The term "school council" is important and sets the tenor of the debate, because it reflects the various bodies that are interested in education in Scotland and does not narrow the definition of education which the Minister's proposals seek to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate on the administration has been wide ranging.

I am sorry that the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) is not here now. He was anxious to argue that school councils have been a considerable success. My right hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) is right to point to Grampian region which, more than any other education authority, developed a successful system of school councils and achieved a great deal. That stands in contrast to some education authorities. But the overall picture is not as rosy as the hon. Member for Fife, Central asked us to accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to quote one view about the success of school councils:
	<br><q><p>"The minimal functions devolved to school councils by regional education committees have undoubtedly militated against establishing the councils as effective bodies and have contributed to the apathy surrounding the work of the councils."</p></q>
Those are the words of the Educational Institute of Scotland in its response to our consultative paper. The hon. Member for Fife, Central must argue about whether school councils have been a success with the EIS and with the many Labour-controlled education authorities which since the 1973 Act and since 1975, have had powers to tranfer considerable responsibilities to school councils but have failed to do so. Only since the publication of our consultative paper have authorities like Strathclyde and Central region suddenly discovered the school councils and the opportunities available to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, I came back at an opportune moment. In my earlier remarks, I tried to focus the Minister's attention on the terminology. I did not comment on the success or otherwise of what had happened previously in Scotland. I said that the terminology of the word "board" smacked of certain aspects of education that I did not support. It is also alien to Scottish culture. In later sittings, I should be happy to discuss with the Minister how successful school councils have been and I share some of his anxiety that the response and success of school councils in my own area of Fife, for example, has been patchy. But in my earlier remarks I talked about descriptions and was not conscious that I was dwelling on the substance of the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wrote down the hon. Gentleman's words and if he checks the 	<i>Official Report</i> he will see that he said that the Government must accept the success of school councils. The EIS and many representations from parents and other bodies say that we should not accept the success of school councils and that there is a general recognitioin that they have not been successful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is on this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that, but the hon. Gentleman
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>60</span>
made his point in his speech and I should like to answer him. The hon. Gentleman chided the Government for being dilatory. He suggested that from 1980 to 1984 the Scottish Office did nothing about developing school councils and following up the results of the Macbeth report. I remind him that we instituted the parents' charter and gave parents the rights that they now exercise in Strathclyde. We also introduced standard grade a major reform in the curriculum. The voices that ask us why we are having an upheaval of education now would have turned into a deafening chorus had we taken this step at the same time as implementing the parents' charter and standard grade.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see no reference to the parents' charter in the Macbeth report and I chided the Minister about inaction and sloth between 1980 and 1986. The Scottish Office must bear a heavy responsibility for that. Having published the Macbeth report, it gave the impression that the Government would take some action, but they failed to do so. When Strathclyde council realised that the Government were taking no action, it stated in its 1986 election manifesto that it would move ahead independently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me mention one other point. Will the Minister concede that if Strathclyde council had made proposals between 1980 and 1986 for changing the system of school councils as it wished to do at a cost which the convenor for Dumfries now estimates at £20 million for Scotland, and therefore £10 million.—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is wandering far, far away from the narrow terms of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had to respond to the Minister, Mr. Knox.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to help the hon. Gentleman while keeping in order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The school councils have been discredited and have been a failure. The hon. Gentleman argues that that is because the Government sat on the Macbeth report. The Government decided that legislation was required. Legislation was going through between 1980 and 1984 to implement the parents' charter. We also put a major burden on the education authorities, the teaching profession and parents with the implementation of standard grades.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the existing legislation, local education authorities in Scotland have had powers since 1975 to give ceiling powers, or anything else that they choose, to school councils, for the hon. Gentleman to accuse the Government of sloth is frankly breathtaking. He alludes to the Strathclyde regional council manifesto on school councils, in which a commitment was given to the electorate to implement additional powers, but the council did nothing about that until the Government issued a consultative paper in December.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Educational Institute of Scotland and others accept the view that they have been a failure, that they have had insufficient powers and been impotent, and that as a result they have not attracted the support that they wished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister concede that if a local authority had made proposals to introduce administrative changes—at a cost of £10 million in the case of Strathclyde—to reform school councils the Minister would have imposed financial penalties on such an authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I do not accept the hon.

It is for education authorities, under their statutory powers, to decide which functions they devolve to

school councils. Experience in my area and eleswhere has been that they have not treated them with much respect.

I make no apology for reverting in the Bill to a good, historical Scots term "the school board."

The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) reminded us of the revolutionaries who had played a part in the history of the Labour party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The history of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman argued that they did so at a time when school boards were not performing functions that he considered appropriate. In Scottish politics these days the revolutionaries are on the Conservative Benches. We are seeking to extend the opportunities for parents and others to participate in the education system. The school boards, to which the hon. Gentleman showed such antipathy, were a feature of the Scottish education system. I am glad that, with his usual perception, he has drawn the Committee's attention to the fact that this proposal is no alien import into Scottish education; it is part of our history, as my hon. Friend for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) pointed out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When school boards were first established in Scottish education they were part of a period of development, enterprise, expansion, energy and extension of opportunities for all types of people. We look forward to a return to such a period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister argues that Scottish school boards have a good tradition, but I disagree with him. Another tradition in Scotland was the board of guardians which ran the workhouse. Is he suggesting that as a Right-wing revolutionary he wants to go back to the system of workhouses?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that I would welcome a period of extension of opportunity, as the period of the introduction of school boards in education was. The term "school board" in future should be synonymous with involved parents, committed teachers and good schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been very generous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the Minister has been generous in giving way. He made the point that the concept of the school board was not alien to the culture of education in Scotland. But they were abolished in 1918 and it was hoped at that time that it was not a temporary respite from the school board system to be reintroduced subsequently by a Conservative Government. The Minister has not grappled with the serious intellectual point about the terminology. The argument is not about the substance of the issue, but about the change to the word "board" which does nothing for the debate and is provocative. While the name "school council" hides a myriad sins in different authorities, it is a concept that sits well in the Scottish culture. Why can we not continue with it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has already made those points in his previous contributions to this debate. I take exception to his suggestion that I am not dealing with the arguments, intellectual or otherwise, put before the Committee.

	<i>[Interruption.]</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall spell it out for the hon. Gentleman. The term "school councils" has been associated with failure and we do not wish to burden the new bodies with that failure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other argument advanced by Opposition Members is that this proposal is an alien import from England. That is not true. School boards are part of our history. The hon. Gentleman is right to point out that the school boards abolished at the turn of the century had different functions and powers and we shall discuss the powers that the proposed school boards will have. I reject the view that this is an alian import into Scottish education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) fairly argued that there was a balance to be considered as to whether we should embrace a new term when we had a perfectly acceptable existing term. That is a good Conservative position, but I take issue with him on one point. He suggested—the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) reinforced the point with the help of his coverless dictionary—that generally boards were appointed bodies and councils were elected bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The old school boards in Scotland were fiercely contested in elections. They were elected bodies. Although it may be the practice in some quoted companies to appoint directors to the board, they are subject to election by shareholders. Debating points aside, there is a fundamental difference between the terms "council" and "board". The term "council" suggests a body that discusses, debates, considers and consults. A "board" suggests an effective organisation that has a job to do and gets on with it. If Opposition Members nod in agreement, they must understand why we wish to pursue our adherence to that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has quoted the dictionary definition of "council". Will he be rigid in his logic and stick with the definition of "board"? If he does so, that will reinforce the point made by the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the Minister's opinion of the proposals in the Macbeth report? What does he think is wrong with them? As the report was commissioned by the Scottish Education Department, it is important that the Minister formulate his views on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt that we shall go on to discuss the report later. The hon. Gentleman will find that the response to the consultative paper, which was dismissed by his party as a climb-down by the Government and widely welcomed, sets out all the arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) asked earlier what members of school boards would be called and said that he would table a new clause on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>64</span>
	<i>[Interuption]</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He now tells me from a sedentary position that he has already done so. I could have spared him the trouble. The collective term is "board members". Clause 2 says that individual members are referred to as "parent members", "staff members" or "co-opted members".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those terms will be subject to amendment because the terminology used in clause 2 is not satisfactory. We shall table amendments to describe members as "school councillors".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We look forward to that, but I thought that I should respond to the hon. Gentleman as he asked me specifically to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked about the number of school boards that would be created. There will be 2,800 school boards and about 25,000 board members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was puzzled that earlier the Minister equated women's committees, which Strathclyde does not have, with the 1,200 school boards—which Strathclyde will have to have. Why did he do that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did no such thing. I responded to a point that the hon. Gentleman made—that the Government would seek to intervene if local authorities, using the powers available to them, took decisions or actions in extending the powers to school councils. I gave the setting up women's committees as an example of the type of body that they could establish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that we are discussing setting up 2,800 elected bodies in Scotland, which will be run by 25,000 parent members, staff members or co-opted members? Let us refer to them generally as "elected members". When local authorities realise that 25,000 elected members will be involved, they will wonder where the money is to come from.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the Minister will not follow that particular hare just now, as he will have the opportunity to do so later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He raised it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I raised it in response to the hon. Member's for Clydebank and Milngavie and for Dundee, East. We are talking about whether the bodies should be called school councils or school boards. I can offer the prospect of salvation for the term "school council", because it might be possible to use both names. The hon. Member for Dundee, East knows that school councils have been umbrella organisations, which have brought together feeder primary schools and secondary schools in each area. They vary from place to place, depending on what is appropriate or convenient. If the House passes the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0788">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>65</span>
Bill as drafted, there is no reason why local authorities could not use their existing powers to continue to operate umbrella organisations. Indeed, later amendments such as amendment No. 60, tabled by the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce), provides for that. The term "school council" which has been associated in Scotland with those forums could, if it was considered appropriate at the local level, continue to be used to describe a body which provides an opportunity for discussion on matters of mutual interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for drawing attention to that fact. I am sure that Catholic schools in Scotland will be grateful to learn that they will not be able to continue as units with feeder, primary schools and secondary schools combined. To settle the argument, could not the Minister allow schools boards or councils to make up their own mind? The legislation could contain provision for each board or council to determine what it shall be called.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So far as I am aware, the hon. Gentleman has not tabled an amendment to that effect. We are discussing whether the bodies that we propose to establish shall be called school boards or school councils. I have to set out the reasons why I think they should be called school boards but in an effort to be helpful to the hon. Gentleman and in recognition of his sense of history and disappointment about the term "school council", I have drawn attention to the fact that school councils could continue to exist in name to describe the bodies that will be set up to provide liaison between individual boards. During the consultation process we received a number of representations to the effect that such bodies would be required, but that is a matter for local determination.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an extremely important point, because in the justification for the Bill there is reference to the cost savings that will be accomplished—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That may well be an important point, but it has nothing to do with the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unusually, I offer the Committee the opportunity to reject the amendment—or the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth may wish to withdraw it—on the basis that it is possible for us to have our cake and eat it on this occasion. Much emphasis has rightly been placed on the consultation process and I reject the view that we did not expect to receive so many representations. We should not have produced 850,000 leaflets and sent them to parents if we did not wish to know parent's views. I am sad that so many Labour authorities were not as helpful as they might have been in getting the leaflets to parents. We wanted to hear and respond to people's views and, as my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) kindly pointed out, we did so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who have combed the many responses that we received will confirm that among the many
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>66</span>
positive ideas, few representations suggested that we should change the name "school board" to "school council" or anything else. Most of the representations rightly concerned the powers and functions, which we shall debate later. I urge the Committee to move on to that business and resolve to attach the name school boards to the bodies that the Bill will set up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the Minister has not taken the opportunity to accept the term "school council". It would have helped our later deliberations if he had been willing to compromise on the matter. Three of his hon. Friends spoke in varying degrees of support of the amendment. His refusal means that I shall have to ask my hon. Friends, to divide the Committee.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are seeking to make the legislation more specific. I do not understand why the Bill is so vague. It ought to spell out what we are talking about. In later amendments we shall discuss widening the scope of the Bill to include private education. This amendment seeks simply to identify which schools we are talking about. There is little more to it than that. There has been a deal of interest in Scotland about the scope of the Bill. I have been asked whether it will apply to this or that type of school. I hope that when the Minister replies to this brief debate he will tell us in some detail to whom this rather general terminology applies. That is what the amendment seeks to clarify. To that extent it is a probing amendment and I do not intend to speak at length on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can help the hon. Gentleman. I understand the thinking behind the amendment. The amendment is not necessary. The notes on clauses which we have made available to all members of the Committee contain a fairly full explanation of clause 1. By virtue of the interpretation clause, clause 22, and the definition which arises from the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 the term "school" here means a public, primary or secondary school. It is clear in the notes on clauses. The hon. Gentleman may have been worried about the position of community schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall have an opportunity to debate that later in the Bill. There are provisions in the Bill to provide for co-options, and so on, to deal with that. The hon. Gentleman may not feel that that is adequate but we can discuss that then. However, he need have no fears about the term "school" being too narrow in this respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of clarification, I understand that clause 22 defines every school as every public primary school, public secondary school and public special school. I am concerned about the list D sector. They are special schools in Scotland, but a number of them are not run by the state or the local authorities. They are not public schools but, for example Church of Scotland schools or Catholic schools. Would those schools be covered by the requirement to have a school council or would they be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>68</span>
regarded as private schools and therefore outwith the terms of the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The terms of the Bill apply to those schools which are covered by the 1980 Act—namely, public primaryu or secondary schools in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So the Minister is saying that list D schools will not be covered, that pupils who attend list D schools in the independent sector will not be covered by the Bill and that their parents will not have a right to have any say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am being advised here. With his experience in local government and in list D schools—
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<i>[Interruption]</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
the hon. Gentleman is perhaps better qualified than I to make the point that list D schools are not under the managemnt of education authorities and as such are not covered by the provisions of the 1980 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we return to private sector schooling on later amendments, I hope that we shall have the opportunity to debate schools in the independent sector, including list D schools. Parents should have a say in the running of those schools because they can sometimes have discipline regimes that some parents may find offensive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give an undertaking to investigate this issue further. He said that list D schools were not run by the local authority. In some cases at least, that is not true. Some list D schools are run by local authorities, and there has been a change in their management in recent years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not use the term "run". I said that they were not under the management of the education authorities. The position is clear. The hon. Gentleman should look at the 1980 Act and the notes on clauses. If a school falls within those definitions, it will clearly be met by the provisions of the Bill. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to extend the scope of the Bill to cover other schools which are not defined in the 1980 Act, he would need to table amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm

The hon. Gentleman's amendment and the questions arising from it arose from an anxiety that the term "school" would not cover all the schools that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee understand as being within the scope of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>No. 38, in page 1, line 24, at end add—
	<br><q><p>"(6) Notwithstanding any of the above it shall be the right of the parents of a school not to have a School Board subject to the following:</p></q>
	<br><q><p>If at the initial establishment of a School Board or at the time of any subsequent biennial election a number of parents, as specified in section 13(1), request in writing of the Education Authority that the functions of the School Board should be exercised by the Authority, the Authority shall proceed to a ballot (in accordance with provisions of Schedule 1) of all parents of pupils in attendance at the school to determine whether a majority of all parents voting in the ballot are in support of the request. Given that there is a majority of all parents in favour of the request, the functions of the School Board shall be exercised by the education authority until such time as a request for a School Board and a ballot in favour are carried out under the conditions specified above and at the times specified above.".</p></q></p>
	<p>No. 39, in page 1, line 24, at end add—
	<br><q><p>"(6) This section shall not apply where not more than 42 days before the date prescribed under section 2(3)(c) of this Act the Education Authority has carried out a ballot of all parents of pupils in attendance at schools in its area and—

	<li>the parents have been invited to vote "yes" or "no" to the establishment of School Boards; and</li>
	<li>a majority of the parents voting have voted "no".</li></ol>
and such a ballot shall be conducted in accordance with Schedule 1 of this Act.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(7) Where, under subsection (6) above, School Boards have not been established the Education Authority shall every two years thereafter carry out a ballot in accordance with that subsection and this section shall apply if a majority of the parents voting vote "yes.".</p></q></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These amendments would allow parents to decide whether they want school boards in their area. Amendment No. 38 specifies that if 30 parents, or one quarter of parents who can vote—whichever is the smaller—specified to their education authority that they thought that the school would be better served if the functions of the school board were taken over by the educational authority, the authority could ballot all members to ascertain whether that was the majority view, and if it was, the authority would take over the functions until request to the contrary was made. That is a reasonable proposal. We are trying to inject choice into the Bill. The Conservative party has hijacked choice and made it one of its favourite words. Conservatives are forever going on about choice and on this occasion, we think that there is a strong case for it—hence our amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 70 provides that the timing of the establishment of school boards should be conditional upon adequate financial provision being made to education authorities to establish and support such boards. The level of financial provision would be the subject of consultation and agreement with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already heard two interesting statistics this morning. They are different from the statistics which I put to the Committee because I was simply looking at schools in Scotland and seeking to work out the numbers that would be required to come forward and serve on the school boards. During the debate on the last amendment, the Minister helpfully identified that we are talking about 2,800 school boards and 28,000 elected persons—that is, new persons offering themselves for election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>70</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for interrupting the hon. Gentleman, but I said 25,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry; I misheard the Minister. He said 25,000. That is still a substantial number of people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. John MacKay has been running around Scotland trying to persuade anyone who is alive and well to come forward as a Tory candidate in the district council elections. The Minister is optimistic if he thinks that he can find 25,000 people in Scotland willing to offer themselves for elected office. That is a remarkable proposition. I hope that his optimism is well founded. I should like to believe that it is, but, after a lifetime's involvement in elections of different sorts, I should be surprised if we do not find that, as with the school councils, there are simply not enough people available to do the work. That would be most unfortunate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the point made by the Educational Institute of Scotland that the functions of the schools councils were too minimal and that, if those functions increased, more people might be interested in administering them. I do not dissent from that view. However, it is wildly optimistic to think that 25,000 people will come forward in Scotland to offer themselves for election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not talking about only 25,000 people coming forward for election, we are talking about a lot more. There are 25,000 seats. Therefore, presumably we are looking for considerably more than 25,000 candidates. If two candidates offered themselves for election for every seat, 50,000 people would have to be found in Scotland to offer themselves for election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know where the Minister thinks that those people are. The proposals are unlikely to encourage that number of people to come forward. I hope that the Minister has something convincing to say about that, because it is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cash is also important. The Tory party likes to think that it understands money. The Prime Minister, the right hon. Member for Finchley (Mrs. Thatcher) and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the right hon. Member for Blaby (Mr. Lawson) are forever going on about sound money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall tell you something about Aberdonians, Mr. Knox, and I am sure that a good Dumfries man like yourself will appreciate it. When it comes to money, we Aberdonians can leave the world behind. We know how to turn a pretty penny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The serious point that I am coming to—[	<i>Hon. Members:</i> "Next Tuesday."] No, we shall deal with the amendment this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must give us a definitive statement about how much it will cost the Scottish education budget to run elections for 50,000 candidates, to elect 25,000 members of school boards. The proposals do not seem to me to make a contribution to Scottish education, although they may contribute to an increased awareness of the importance of seeking
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0791">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>71</span>
election to various sorts of office. The proposals will not add to the excellence of our schools, but will simply spend cash that could otherwise be directed to the main function of schools—educating children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Suggestions about the cost of the proposals have varied considerably. Conservative run Dunfries and Galloway regional council has told us that it will cost £20 million to run school boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has the Minister to say to Conservatives members of that authority so that they know whether the information that they have received from local government officers is correct? The Minister should respond to the claim made by Dumfries and Galloway education authority. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) has temporarily left the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to hear what the Minister has to say to the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, which is a well-respected body in Scottish local government. COSLA says that the cost of school boards will be £15 million. That figure is based on inquiries made among members of COSLA, which covers all Scottish authorities. As far as I know, Kincardine and Deeside district council—I am trying to catch the eye of the right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith)—has not left the convention, although there was a threat that it might. I gather that it has not. So every education authority and every district council is a member of COSLA, which has concluded that the cost of school boards will be £15 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are convinced that the cost will be £5 million. I do not know where the Government got those figures. Are they consulting the same people as COSLA? I do not understand how there can be such a difference. The amendment seeks to establish the facts and to provide that local authorities will not be put in the unfortunate position of having to find vast sums to run elections and then adminster and service school boards while not receiving financial recompense to enable them to continue their routine and appropriate functions of running education in the regions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 69 is a technical amendment to facilitate the others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have been brief and kept to the point and that the Minister can now say how much school boards will cost the Scottish people in hard cash. It seems that we are being asked to pay for something that will be extremely costly. I do not know how we can run elections for so many candidates without massive costs. Can the Minister say who gives him his financial advice and why he has concluded that such a small sum is involved when a major education authority has claimed that it will cost four times that amount?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman grouped amendment No. 70 with those that I have selected?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I turn first to amendments Nos 38 and 39, which deal with the right of parents to use the ballot box to decide whether they wish to have a school board for their school. Parents in Scotland may decide not to avail themselves of the opportunity that this legislation presents. Some parents might have good reasons for not wanting a school board to run their school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is common knowledge that the number of pupils in Scotland is anywhere between 1,800 and 2,000 per school. Technically, therefore, as many as 4,000 electors may be voting seven parent members onto a board. Those parent members would form a majority of the board and would run the school. The 4,000 electors may ask whether they can trust seven individuals with the running of their children's school, especially if they do not know a great deal about those seven individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister gave an assurance that it will not be allowed for those elections to be conducted on party political lines. None of the candidates for election to the school board will be able to present themselves as candidates of a given political party expressing a given political view on education and how schools should be run.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think my hon. Friend has misquoted the Minister. The Minister did not say that candidates would not be allowed to conduct elections in such a way. He said that he would discourage it. In that respect, he was admirably different from the Secretary of State for Education and Science in England and Wales, who was encouraging Conservatives to stand for the English equivalent of school boards. There seems to be a split in the attitude of Ministers in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a fair point. I understood from the Minister's response that there would be no party politics within our schools and our education system. That now seems not to be the case. The Minister harked back to the pre-1918 school boards in Scotland, He said that they had been fiercely contested on party political grounds by party political candidates and that people were elected to run the boards with a specific party political views. I shall give way to the Minister so that he can explain what he said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0792">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>73</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman studies the 	<i>Official Report</i> he will discover that I said that we would not consider such a contest desirable, or words to that effect. I did not say that it would not be allowed. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to extend the provision so that it would not be allowed, it is open to him to table an amendment that we could discuss at a suitable point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly the Minister intends that school boards elections will be elected to run schools. A Conservative school board may run schools in one part of the town. In the next ward there may be a Labour school board, in the next an alliance school board and somewhere else a nationalist school board. How that would achieve a cohesive educational system in a city such as Dundee is beyond me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parents may say that if that is what the Minister is offering the education system in Scotland they should have the right at the ballot box to say that they prefer to leave the schools in the hands of the education authorities. Those authorities are elected on a party political basis which is well understood throughout Scotland and with which people are happy. Our amendments would allow parents to decide whether they want their school to be politicised rather than leaving it up to this Committee, the House or local education authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Coming from Dundee, I am worried that a small group of parents will be in control of considerable sums of money. It will have the right to raise, spend and invest money and 4,000 parents may ask why seven parents should have control over such a great sum of money. The Bill provides no method by which the parents could scrutinise how the seven elected people fulfill their responsibilities to control the budget. That budget will not be given to them by the education authorities. They will raise it and spend it under their own steam. I am not satisfied that that is a good idea and I am sure that many parents will not think it a good idea to allow small and possibly unrepresentative groups of parents to handle money for the school. Although provision may be made for a postal ballot, people could be elected on turnouts as low as 10, 15 or 20 per cent, of the potential electorate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The sort of percentage who voted Tory in the general election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That group will have control over money and selection of staff and influence over the curriculum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does not the hon. Gentleman table an amendment about what is worrying him? That would give us the opportunity to consider the matter in some depth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the amendment that we are discussing confronts the matter directly. If parents do not wish to go down the road that the Minister is offering to them, the amendment will allow them to say, "No, we do not want anything to do with school boards. Leave our schools as they are and leave our school councils as they are."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>74</span>
Parents in some areas of Scotland may be grateful for the opportunity to use the ballot box to reject the structure that the Minister is trying to impose upon them by the medium of the Bill. All members of the Committee should think very carefully about that before they decide how to vote on this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to amendment No. 70. My regional council—Tayside—has not yet had an opportunity to make a formal representation to the Minister on the financial implications of school boards. However, their officers have already made available to members of the council and to other interested bodies their initial thoughts about the problems and the cost that may arise from setting up school boards. For example, they observe that education authorities will now be expected to supply a range of new information to, in the case of Tayside, more than 400 school boards. They will have to provide all sorts of detailed financial information and information about the curriculum, per capita expenditure and regional council policy directives, with which the school board will have to be in line. All that will necessitate extra expenditure and extra staff. The regional councils do not know what the extra cost will be. The Committee is being asked to write a blank cheque, which the Minister may or may not honour. The Minister does not know what the cost will be but he asks us to approve the measure and to allow it to go through. He probably expects local authorities rather than central Government to carry the burden of the extra costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Head teachers will have more onerous duties in respect of school boards than they have now in respect of school councils. Teacher representatives will perhaps have to take their membership of school boards more seriously than they do that of school councils. Therefore, head teachers and teacher representatives will need time off to enable them to fulfill their functions in a more realistic way. There will be implications for staffing of schools. More staff will have to be taken on to enable head teachers and teachers to fulfill their responsibilities. That, in turn, will have cost implications for local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr.Hogg) said, the elections will also cost money. Tayside will have to hold more than 400 elections to school boards, involving many thousands of parents, which will involve massive costs. Local authorities do not know exactly what the costs will be but they will certainly be well in excess of anything that the Minister has allowed for in his preposterous figure of £5 million for the whole of Scotland. If school boards are to receive vast amounts of information about finance, curriculum, policy directives, curriculum assessment and so on, they will need computers to enable them to control, collate and use it in a way that will enhance education in schools. That, too will have cost implications.

I make no comparison between the Minister and Adolf Hitler; for a start, the Minister's hair is swept back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I made a serious point in saying that the Bill has grave cost implications for education authorities. The Minister has made no real attempt to consider those implications and to say that money will be made available to education authorities to enable them to fulfill their responsibilites under the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In taking up the hon. Gentleman's serious point, I want to be clear about what he is saying. When he says that we have made no real attempt to follow up the question of cost, is he arguing that there should be a specific grant for that purpose?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whether it be a specific grant, or whether the Secretary of State for Scotland, when he decides on the rate support grant for individual education authorities, makes sure that an increased grant is given, is a matter for the Government to decide. But the Government must make available money to underpin the costs of implementing the Bill because they are imposing it on education authorities in Scotland. Therefore, they should not expect education authorities to pay for it from their existing budget. Is the Minister saying that local education authorities must make financial provision for setting up school boards, which no one in Scotland really wants? The answer was made absolutely clear by the Government's consultative process.

The Minister is imposing a system on Scotland which, he says, will cost about £5 million. That is unrealistic. He has yet to produce a shred of evidence to substantiate his claim. Indeed, £5 million extra would hardly pay for the school board system in Tayside region, let alone throughout Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So the Minister must state precisely where he gets that figure from. How will he equip school boards with computers and allow teachers and head teachers time off to attend school board meetings? Furthermore how will he provide the information and extra local authority staff to allow the school board system to work? Until he answers these points the Bill will be seen for what it is, and ideological sham.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that Tayside region has no computers? In the education department and the schools there are plenty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am suggesting nothing of the sort. Of course there are computer systems in the education authority. The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) should listen to members of the Committee rather than getting on with his contituency work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>76</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was listening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He just does not understand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was arguing that new computers would be needed for the school boards. The school boards do not yet exist, and those who work on them will need access to computers at their own convenience, rather that queing up on a waiting list that is 400 schools long before thay gain access to a computer at Tayside house. If that is what the hon. Gentleman suggests should be done in Tayside region, it shows how unrealistic his attitude is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such serious points have been raised by officials, not by elected, political people in Tayside region. Officials are expressing grave concern about the cost implications of the new system. It is time that elected members, of local authorities and we in this place listened to what the officials, who know what they are talking about, are saying, and started to find means of providing money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the hon. Gentleman that it is always wise to remember what those officials said in the past. I remind him of what they said when we were introducing the legislation on the parents' charter. Much of what was said then has not happened in practice. We must always listen to officials, but we must measure what they are saying against their previous comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Tory elected representatives of Tayside regional councils had listened to officials before the 1986 elections, they may not have attempted the school closure programme which ended with them being kicked out of office by the people of Tayside. One should listen to officials and make judgments about their advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<i>[Interruption.]</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I missed that point. If the Secretary of State wishes to intervene, I shall give way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are serious matters. The Minister is forcing a half-baked scheme upon local education authorities and the people of Scotland. He has not thought out the cost implications or the political implications of politicising the Scottish education system, which he has admitted may well be at the end of the road that we are starting on this morning. Members of the Committee should consider that carefully before voting with the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important issue and worthy of careful study, because the primary amendment seeks to ascertain whether the Minister really wishes to give parents a choice. Tories talk a great deal about freedom of choice in health care and education, and it is sad that in practice that is the freedom to use the privilege of one's birth or fortunate financial circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the libertarian perspective which the Minister is supposed to hold from his background in economics, he should allow parents who are responsible people to decide for themselves whether
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0794">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>77</span>
they wish to assume the burden of managing a school. If they are responsible, they should be given both sides of the choice—true freedom of choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are examples of the Government's attitude to choice. Last week the Inner London education authority ballot of parents took place. An overall majority—53 per cent.—of parents of children in the ILEA area rejected the Government's proposals to abolish ILEA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It depends on what questions are asked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: the question was, "Do you want ILEA to be abolished or not?"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is in order for the hon. Gentleman to allude to that, but I hope that he will not go down that road to far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The role of temptor—or temptress—is not one to which I would normally ascribe to the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<i>[Laughter.]</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mean temptor—it is the skirts that do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I used the example of ILEA to illustrate the point that freedom of choice is not empty rhetoric and that it should be adhered to in practice. When the Goverment were given the opportunity to demonstrate freedom of choice with ILEA, they showed that they did not adhere to it in practice. I am trying to give the Minister the opportunity to show that he really believes in freedom of choice for parents by giving them the choice to opt out—Oops! The hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) is not here. I mean, of course, the choice to opt out from the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<i>[Interruption.]</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was said intentionally, not accidentally. The hon. Member for Eastwood, who has just returned to the Committee room, opted out of government a long time ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parents have rights, so they should be able to decide for themselves. The Bill should allow for that. Do parents want to manage schools? I do not think so. I have spoken to many parents on the issue. Meetings were held in my constituency, which were widely attended, but the consensus was that parents did not want to run their schools. They want their children professionally to be educated and properly cared for in schools. They want to be consulted regularly and informed about how their own child is doing, not how the child down the road is doing. They are interested in other people only in the altruistic sense with regard to their general well-being. They want individual advice and help from teachers and staff when necessary. They do not want to tell teachers what to do and, generally, they do not wish to manage schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of cost has been aired in earlier speeches
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>78</span>
and I do not propsoe to spend long on that. Judging by other measures, they are generally much more expensive than first thought. I am not implying any great criticism by that as there are often unforeseen costs. In the computerisation of housing benefit, local authorities—on one of which I served—were told clearly about the expected costs, but the actual cost was, for my own authority, many thousand of pounds greater. That is a typical example of how costs can overrun.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will not put their hand in their pocket and fork out for the extra costs. Local authorities will be expected to provide the money from within their limited resources, and if they overspend according to the Government's artificial guidelines, that amount will not be disregarded and so they will incur penalties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally in support of my argument, I shall quote the Secretary of State's opening words on Second Reading: He said:
	<br><q><p>"the extent to which parents in any community with regard to any school should assume executive or advisory resonsibilities over that school should be determined by the parents themselves and not by the Government or by the local authority. If we believe in the principal of parental involvement, clearly it is inappropriate for the Government or for local authorities to determine the extent to which parents should be able, permitted or empowered to take into account the responsibilities that they wish to enjoy."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 12 April 1988; Vol. 131, c. 30.]</p></q>
I could not have put it better myself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to develop the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie). The most powerful critique of the Bill is that it bypasses parents, and when the Minister reads the 	<i>Official Report</i> he will become more aware of what I am saying. That is important. My hon. Friends have alluded to the question of choice, and all the Government's proposals are littered with the word, "choice". But this set of proposals attacks and undermines local authority education provision and involves a major attack on professionalism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These two attacks culminate in the Government suggesting that the best solution would be to have a small number of parents representing a large number of parents in the running and management of particular schools. I am anxious about the worries of parents and organisations over the proposals and it is important to record some of these.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy referred to the set of criteria on which most parents would judge a good school's performance—very few of which are in the Bill. Parents want involvement, participation and partnership in the running of schools, but they are strongly against having an executive or management role. That became clear in the consultation process, and I am sure that the Government would not distance themselves from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government seek to foist a rigid system on every school in Scotland, that should be accompanied by what my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy referred to as an opting-out provision within the Bill that would allow parents to say, "Yes, we want to participate in a particular school, but we should prefer
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0795">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>79</span>
education authority and the teachers to run it."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parents are interested in the welfare of their own children. As I have said previously, I am a parent and it is important that parents' views are put on record. Many bodies purport to represent parents, and when I read their documents I often think that they do not reflect my views as a parent or those of other parents. I am interested in the welfare of my children, and that relates to how the school performs in satisfying that objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My two children will be attending a comprehensive school in Glenrothes, which will possibly have 1,200 children. That could perhaps mean 6,000 parents, possibley more. Am I to believe that my participation in my child's education will be enhanced by a few people—
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<i>[Interruption].</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may laugh, but the idea of 25,000 people being dragooned into running education is a philistine view, and I use the word advisedly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the example that I was using, I shall be forced to participate in a ballot to elect a few people to run the school that my children attend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to finish this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall then have to accept the diktats of that group for the period of the term of election. We are arguing—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Gentleman reads his remarks, I am not sure whether he will wish to stand by what he is saying. Is he suggesting that the election of councillors to district and regional councils or of hon. Members to Parliament is different from the election of people to run schools? That is not so because it is the same process: a small number of people representating the views of many introduce measures that they believe will benefit most people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Without getting involved in a lecture on participative democracy, I should like to point out that they are two entirely different concepts. I have two children who wish to be educated and I want the best education for them. We are seeking the best way to extend parental involvement in the functions of schools. The election of a set of councillors to deal with a wide range of issues is a different concept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>80</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to bore you, Mr. Knox, by developing that point. The hon. Member for Tayside, North should reflect on it and return to it later. It is interesting that the Conservatives feel rather edgy about bypassing parents on this issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about trade unions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment seeks to provide another layer of choice. If Conservatives share my views as a parent, they might wish to say that Fife or Strathclyde is running the school in a way that will enhance my child's chances. I should be able to participate in a ballot to say whether the school should have a board to run its affairs. That seems a modest contribution to the debate, but the problem is that the rigidity of the proposals excludes the prospect of concessions that would allow the majority of parents to choose what suits their requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another fact that emerged during the consultation process was that teachers have the trust and confidence of most parents. We may argue that parents per se need to perform all executive functions, but most parents to whom I have spoken greatly admire the quality of education and of teachers. That is surely another argument for allowing choice in the ballot to decide whether or not to have a board. I hope that the Committee will take that point seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To reinforce the quality of my arguments, I shall quote the right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith). I was disappointed that he did not vote for the previous amendment this morning. On 5 November 1987 the 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> stated:
	<br><q><p>"Mr. Buchanan-Smith suggested that the new structure should be based on existing school councils which should be given a statutory right to be involved."</p></q>
He was arguing for evolution, not the revolutionary nonsence—purported by the Minister earlier in the debate. The right hon. Member for Kincadine and Deeside wanted choice to be real, not illusory. Choice is the key issue—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
