<div class='debates'><span class='label label-warning'>debates</span>

<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>School Boards (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I call the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland to move the sittings motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cumbernauld and Kilsyth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Knox. It seems that we are never able to conduct Scottish business without getting lost in arguments about procedure, the size of the Committee, and so on. I understand that you have no responsibility for appointments to the Committee or for its size, but somehow we seem unable to regulate our business through the usual channels as other Standing Committees do. On this occasion, the difficulties turn on the fact that the Government have appointed to the Committee the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) who is currently very ill. We are all very concerned for him and send him our warmest wishes for a speedy recovery. We should like to see him with us, but if his illness is as serious as is reported in the press we must conclude that he will not be able to attend the sittings of this Committee. My hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) and I therefore sought to persuade the Government through the usual channels that it would be in the interests of the Committee if the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross were released from the service of the Committee and another Member appointed. It would not be appropriate to go into detail as the discussions were confidential, but all manner of arguments ensued about the size of the Committee, and so on. The Government wanted to increase the size of the Committee.<br><br>
The point that I wish to bring to your attention, Mr. Knox, is that under the Standing Orders of the House 16 Scottish Members—hon. Members representing Scottish constituencies—are required to serve on a Standing Committee of the House when it is considering Scottish business. Surely it was in the Government's power to appoint another Scottish Member to the Committee. Had they taken that action we would not have had any of our difficulties about starting the Committee, the date of the sittings motion and all the rest of it.<br><br>
There is something wrong here and I seek your guidance, Mr. Knox, about how we might proceed. I am anxious to be as constructive and helpful as possible in our proceedings today. Is there some way in which we can tell the Government through the usual channels or whatever means are open to us that the appointment
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
of the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross is not appropriate? The Government must not be seen to be acting in this way because it is not in the interests of the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart <span class='memberconstituency'>(Eastwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Knox. It is surely without precedent for the Opposition to complain about Government proposals which have given them an extra Member on the Committee. Surely there is no precedent for the Opposition wasting the Committee's time when such a generous offer was made by the Government's business manager.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As both hon. Members know perfectly well, the selection of members of Standing Committees is nothing to do with the Government. It is a matter for the Committee of Selection. If hon. Members object to the hon. Members who have been selected to any Committee they should make their representations to the Committee of Selection.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take no exception to your ruling, Mr. Knox, but I must say that the assertion that appointments to Committees do not have anything to do with the Government will come as news to the Government Chief Whip and his hon. Friends.<br><br>
I should tell the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) that we do not seek to waste the Committee's time. We are anxious to get on with the Committee's business. The Government seem anxious to get on with the business, too, as they have called for the Committee to sit today, but they have appointed a Member to the Committee who cannot contribute to its work. That cannot be right. Surely a Standing Committee can by some means report to the Committee of Selection that a Member who has been appointed is unable to serve. I should have thought that that view would have been understood by a good parliamentarian like the hon. Member for Eastwood.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman will be aware, even the usual channels do not exist for the Chairman. However, any hon. Member who wishes to make representations about the membership of a Committee must do it through the Committee of Selection.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McAllion <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Knox. Many of the Conservative Members of the Committee are the same as those who sat on the Housing (Scotland) Bill, one of whom was the hon. and learned member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn). The honourable and learned Gentleman contributed to the work of the Bill, as did the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker). Apart from the Minister and those two Members, the other Conservative Members contributed nothing to the debate. The same is likely to be the case on this Bill.<br><br>
As the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross has been named as a member of the Committee but will not be present, the Bill would be better scrutinised and more keenly debated if he were replaced by an hon. Member likely to contribute to the work of the Committee. That is a matter for the Committee of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0756">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
Selection, in consultation with the Government Whips. As the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross cannot contribute due to illness, the Government Whips have a responsibility to suggest to the Committee of Selection an alternative hon. Member who would be able to contribute to this Committee, which is considering an important bill with great implications for education in Scotland. Proceedings on the Bill are keenly watched by parents throughout Scotland and it is an insult to them if the Government Whips cannot man the Committee properly with people able to take part.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Knox. I went to see my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) in hospital on Firday. I think that I spoke for the whole Committee when I told him to concentrate on making a full recovery from his operation. Besides telling me how we should reorganise the National Health Service as a result of his experiences, he told me that he was anxious to participate in the Committee, which I dissuaded him from doing. Surely his replacement and the Committee's composition is best settled outside the Committee. I know from Second Reading that the Opposition are anxious to improve the Bill so that, as they put it, it does not simply pay lip service to parental involvement. I should have thought that it would be wise for the Committee to get on with consideration and improvement of the Bill, rather than with detaining ourselves with this matter, which should be settled outside.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Knox. The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) mentioned that my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) had contributed in the previous Scottish Standing Committee. Anyone who has sat in Committees with my hon. and learned Friend will know that he always contributes, and that we shall miss him. Hon. Members on any Standing Committee contribute as and when they judge fit, and anyone who suggests that I do not contribute in Standing Committees of which I am a member has obviously not served on one with me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know how I am supposed to reply to that, but none of the alleged points of order is a matter for the Chair. If any Committee member rises, he will be called to speak by me, but I have no responsibility for ensuring that hon. Members speak or keep quiet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Knox. Is the Committee in order, given that your appointment as Chairman was made after the Committee notices were served, the appointments made to the Committee and the notice of this sitting of the Committee served on hon. Members? On Thursday morning we received a second notice announcing that you had been appointed as the Committee's principal Chairman, but many hon. Members did not receive that notice. The Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Grantham (Mr. Hogg) received mine, so I did not receive notice until Monday.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
That raises many interesting points on which you may feel able to rule, Mr. Knox. Is it in order for the Committee to meet this morning when the Clerks called the Committee before it had a Chairman? That cannot be in order. When my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) raised those matters in the Chamber last Thursday he was supported by Mr. Speaker. The matter cannot be put right retrospectively. That is a bad principle. The Government legislate retrospectively on many subjects. That shows what a bad example it is, and I know that you, Mr. Knox, would not want to follow a bad example. I hope that you will therefore rule on that question.<br><br>
Notwithstanding our anxiety about how it was done, we are delighted that you, Mr. Knox, were appointed as our Chairman because you have an intimate knowledge of Scottish affairs. You are the only Scotsman serving an English constituency whom my colleagues accept as legitimate at Scottish Question Time as you always table a question to the Secretary of State for Scotland. We accept you as legitimate in that respect, Mr. Knox, and you enjoy a respectability that others do not. But I invite your ruling on the important point about the appointment of a Chairman and the validity of the Committee meeting this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the postal authorities mistook the hon. Gentleman for the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department. Anybody who knows both hon. Members would not make such a mistake. A technical mistake was made last week when the notices were sent out. It was arranged that I should chair the Committee and although the Clerks were trying to find Mr. McWilliam to act as co-Chair, they had not succeeded, so Mr. Speaker had not signed the form about my appointment when the cards were sent out. So a technical mistake was make.<br><br>
When I was appointed last Thursday morning, I authorised that the note sent by Mr. John Rose to Committee members should confirm the original card that had been sent. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) did not receive his notice because it went to the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Grantham (Mr. Hogg), who must have had an awful shock to think that he would have to attend this Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the School Boards (Scotland) Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock, other than Thursday 12 May.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the sittings motion. I believe in setting precedents. The Under-Secretary of State and, indeed, the Secretary of State are used to sittings motions being hotly contested, particularly by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), who has a particular line in resisting sittings motions although he greatly enjoys sitting in Committees. He must be sorry not to be here today. As a Conservative Member once said to me, we are here to create precedents. That would no doubt be supported by the Under-Secretary of State, the hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0757">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), who never stops setting precedents. I hope that I am setting a precedent today by supporting the sittings motion. My hon. Friends will agree that the motion has great merit as it does not propose that we meet in the afternoons and reflects the fact that the Government, rightly, are not in a hurry to pass the Bill.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
Public education in Scotland has existed for a long time. Hon. Members who represent Scottish constituencies may be interested to know that education in Scotland was first determined as a matter of public policy at a meeting in the Tollbooth in Edinburgh in August 1563. I think that it was on 24 August of that year. On that occasion the Book of Discipline was signed and it was determined that there should be widespread education in every parish in Scotland. The interesting parallel between that occasion and this morning is that a Knox presided over both occasions. Your forebear, Mr. Knox, would be pleased to know that you are in the Chair today.<br><br>
The Government have recognised that we do not need to rush the Bill through but can debate it at length. They will be pleased to hear that the Opposition will probably willingly agree that the matter be concluded in the spillover in October, as that seems to be the best way in which to proceed. We want to debate all the interesting issues that the Under-Secretary of State has raised during his short tenure of office as the Minister responsible for education and, it seems, almost everything else. He has created a debate in Scotland about education, and the Bill gives us the first opportunity to debate his proposals in depth. We are pleased that the sittings motion facilitates that.<br><br>
As we progress through the Committee, we shall be able to deal with the views of parents, of parent-teacher associations, of regional education authorities, who have a significant input to make to our deliberations, and of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, which is much respected in Scotland and which will write to every member of the Committee setting out its considered reaction to each clause. We shall want to hear from the trade unions, not least the Educational Institute of Scotland, which is the largest teachers' organisation in Scotland and has a special place in the Scottish education system. We also want to hear from universities and colleges regarding higher education.<br><br>
I wish to raise the matter of two dates about which I am concerned. There is to be a conference of Scottish Conservatives in Scotland and I appreciate that that is an important date in their calendar. I was not quite sure whether that was the date that the Minister gave us when he moved the sittings motion. Many members of the Committee will want to go to Perth that day to contribute to the discussions. If we help the Government by approving this excellent sittings motion, I am certain that the hon. Member for Dorset, South (Mr. Bruce) will want to go to Perth to make his very special contribution. I note that the hon. Gentleman shares with me the distinction of having more than 50 per cent of the votes cast in his
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
constituency. In my case it is 60 per cent, but what is 10 per cent between friends? He will probably want to go to Scotland to explain to the Scottish Tories how he can get returned to Parliament with a majority in excess of 50 per cent while they, poor souls, are left struggling against terrible odds aided only by a large press corps and Mr. John Mackay.<br><br>
I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is adequately endowed to fight this corner on behalf of the Scottish Tories. He has a long history of losing seats. He fought a highly marginal seat in Burnley and lost, which was not awfully good. Then he fought a European seat, which was a huge mistake and tells us that his judgment is not very good. The hon. Gentleman is a manufacturing consultant. We could certainly use some manufacturing in Scotland. He is a company chairman—I hope that he will set up his companies in Scotland. He was founder of Trialogue—which sounds as if it might be something to do with Hong Kong, but is in fact the Yorkshire candidates forum.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman could bring himself back into order if he could suggest that the hon. Member for Dorset, South (Mr. Bruce) had some connection with education.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He has indeed, Mr. Knox. Apparently he was a scout leader. I am sure that he could be employed by the Scottish Tories to go scouting for votes in Perth.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Bruce <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dorset, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Knox. A strange attitude from the Opposition suggests that I am something other than a Scottish Tory. Newspaper articles have suggested that I am an English Conservative Member of Parliament and I cannot understand it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that is a point of order for the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it should be raised with the returning officer for Dorset, South, which I understand is somewhere in England—but that, as a famous Conservative Prime Minister might have said, is a faraway country of which we know little. I do not even know where Dorset, South is, although I believe that the trade union movement was founded in Dorset.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that there is only one English hon. Member in the Committee, the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington), who is sitting behind the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the discussion has a great deal to do with when we are sitting. I am not quite sure whether the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) is suggesting that we should sit in Dorset. Perhaps he could bring himself back into order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Certainly; I am delighted to do that, Mr. Knox. My hon. Friend the Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) will defend himself soon. The hon. Member for Dorset, South (Mr. Bruce) is, of course, welcome to our proceedings because we are

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
doing missionary work and he will benefit from that. The hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean)—the poor man's Willie Whitelaw—is here, disguised as a Whip. He fought Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber. Anybody who fights that seat has a certain distinction, and he too will want to go to the Tory conference.<br><br>
The point—which I know you are waiting for, Mr. Knox—is, where is all that in order? I shall tell you. I am led to the conclusion that when members of the Committee of Selection chose the hon. Members for Dorset, South and for Penrith and The Border to serve on this Committee, they knew that they would have to go to the Scottish conference in Scotland with their colleagues. We agree with them and I want you to know, Mr. Knox, that Labour members of this Committee—and, I am sure, the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce)—believe that it would be a good idea if they were to attend the Scottish conference.<br><br>
There is another important date which has not been included in the sittings motion. The district council elections in Scotland will take place on 5 May. I do not know why the Minister did not say that the Committee would not sit on that occasion. If there is something even more urgent than the Tory party conference, it is the district council elections on 5 May and Conservative Members will have to be away that day. I want the hon. Member for Penrith and The Border to know that we will willingly agree not to meet that day because the Tories will have to go to Scotland to fight hard to hold on to third place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I suggest to my hon. Friend one of the reasons why the Minister did not include 5 May in the sittings motion as a date on which the Committee would not sit? Conservative Members may be looking for an excuse not to be in Scotland on that day, when the Conservatives will undoubtedly be given a mauling by the electorate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend must not tempt me to be partisan when I am trying to put forward a perfectly reasonable suggestion that the ten twilight Tories should be allowed to return to Scotland to fight the district council elections. They are the last rays of the setting sun of Scottish Conservatism. One or two Conservative Members have a bit more light about them than some of the others. I have a great deal of time for the right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith). He is far too sensible to be sitting on the Government Benches. I am glad that he is sitting beside the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro), because I rather like him as well. It is difficult to imagine how two Conservative Members could go out of their way to disassociate themselves from the rest of their colleagues in the way that those two have; they are almost sitting out on the Terrace. I look forward to hearing what they have to say.<br><br>
However, far from being sunrays, some Conservative Members are sunspots and there is no doubt that the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) is in that category. He has caused more bother than anyone else. The Bill is his fault, and that is why the Government are in no
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
hurry to get on with it, and why I strongly favour the sittings motion.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
It was good of the Secretary of State for Scotland to look in this morning. I am sure that he will look in again, because he is a member of the Committee. I would be reluctant to describe him as a twilight Tory because he used to be a supernova. He came forward at a great rate of knots as someone who was to have a great future and who would be able to help with such matters, but he seems to have disappeared over the horizon. His place has been taken by the hon. Member for Stirling who is now the commissar on the ship which is sailing none too well through the troubled waters of Scottish politics. He advises the Government on policy. That is helpful because the Committee will always know the true mind of the Government. Although the right honourable and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind) now takes a back seat, the hon. Member for Stirling will head the show.<br><br>
I am sure that all his press releases and his many speeches—even the one moving the sittings motion—are currently being processed in Chester Street by the five press agents who shore up the works and put out the news.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dumfries)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Member for Dumfries supports me. He has a grasp of such matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How long will this soliloquy go on?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For a little while yet, because the Government have made clear by the sittings motion that they are not in a great hurry.<br><br>
The sittings motion is the best that I have experienced in a Standing Committee. The hon. Member for Stirling sets another precedent and on this occasion we support him 100 per cent. It is important to establish that we shall be off on the day of the district council elections. I want to be able to telephone John McKay later this morning and say, "It's all right, the ten Tories plus the hon. Member for Dorset, South are on their way to see what can be done in the district elections". I want to be able to do that because I am a wee bit sorry for him. He is struggling to get the number of candidates that he hoped to get.</span></p>
<p><i>[Interruption.]</i></p>
<p>I am told that there are more. That is wonderful news.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should be aware that the target was 600 and that we have exceeded that substantially.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I realise that the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) was provoked, but I would be grateful if the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) would occasionally mention
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0759">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
when the Committee is sitting. He did for a minute or two, but then he wandered off the subject again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If you tell me, Mr. Knox, that I am wandering out of order, I shall rapidly come back into order. I was listening carefully to my remarks, but even I could not see their relevance.<br><br>
The Bill has an importance that goes beyond its clauses and schedules. Up until a few weeks ago we concluded that the Government had changed their mind about some of the more eccentric ideas of the hon. Member for Stirling. He brought forward proposals for school boards that went far beyond the Bill. Those with a more suspicious mind, such as myself, thought it odd that he had apparently abandoned some of his ideas. We read the School Boards (Scotland) Bill carefully to see whether it contained any hidden minefields and it certainly does. Three of the clauses should be discussed in depth and I am sure that arrangements will be made to do that.<br><br>
However, we are even more worried about the Bill's hidden agenda, which is why we shall have to take our time and consider this matter carefully. The leaked letters—the latter-day casket letters—between the Cabinet Office and the Scottish Office were almost as odd as yesterday's revelations about Back Benchers beginning to understand the issues. Letters written in such a tone lead us to believe that this measure is not only designed to establish school boards but to pave the way for the opting out of schools from local authority management. Therefore, we must spend time considering the Bill to ensure that we do not concede such a measure because the Scottish electorate has not consented to that, as will be shown.<br><br>
Those considerations are important and I hope that the Government understand that we support the sittings motion but with the caveat that hon. Members should be able to attend local government elections on the first Thursday in May. I hope that the Minister will understand the merit of that, because 600 plus Conservative candidates should not be left without the services of ten Scottish hon. Members plus the hon. Member for Dorset, South (Mr. Bruce). Mr. John McKay may have hit on a brilliant wheeze by keeping hon. Members at the House, but that is an unworthy thought and I shall quickly pass to another point.<br><br>
It is 10 minutes past 11 o-clock and I have been speaking for about a half an hour. That is long enough.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Keep going.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) says that I should keep going. I do not want you to hold that against him, Mr. Knox, because he is a new hon. Member and he is doing well.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I might hold it against the hon. Gentleman for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to keep going because I have exhausted what I wanted to say. I hope in view
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
of the warm welcome that I have given to the sittings motion, that the Minister will add to it that members of the Committee will be able to attend the district council elections on Thursday 5 May. If so, we could move on to the important consideration of the Bill.<br><br>
However, I am sure that the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) will want to hear further from my colleagues because it is not every day that he gets support from all sides. That must be a unique occasion for him and he will want to savour the moment. I am sure that my hon. Friends will join me in supporting the excellent sittings motion that the Minister has proposed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Worthington <span class='memberconstituency'>(Clydebank and Milngavie)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have to rise as my parentage has been questioned. I confirm for the hon. Member for Dorset, South (Mr. Bruce) that there is no Scottish connection in my background. One of the least read books, which was produced by the Worthingtons of medieval England and written by Philip Worthington, shows that there were Worthingtons in Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire and, I think, in Dorset and a clustering in Lancashire, which is the furthest north that we went.<br><br>
However, I am consoled on the issue of who is a Scot by the authoritative ruling of the former Provost of Cumbernauld and Kilsyth, Gordon Murray of unblessed memory, of about whom my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) is familiar. The Provost pronounced that anyone in Scotland at a particular time was a Scot whether or not he wished to be. That fairly authoritative ruling qualifies me for the Committee as I have lived in Scotland for 17 years. However, the same gentleman ruled on another occasion that he had a plan for increasing the population of Scotland to 10 million, but he did not disclose the weapons by which it was to be achieved, so that perhaps invalidates his ruling on who is a Scot.<br><br>
We all support the desire of Tory Members to be present at a small intimate gathering—their conference—on 12 May. Is that the smallest gathering for which the sitting of a Committee has been cancelled? We should check the precedents. The Tory party conference would be in danger of being a loss-making venture if the eight Tory Members on this Committee could not attend. It is crucial that they attend, otherwise, as happened in my constituency, the fund raiser could be begged to cease his activities because of the damage that he is doing to the party.<br><br>
As the Bill is about involvement, I urge that the sitting scheduled for 5 May should be cancelled because it is important that the Scottish Members who wish to be in Scotland to take part in what is the best illustration of involvement should be able to do so. Some Members might want to be as far from Scotland as possible on the day of mourning, but we should overcome that and urge that the sittings motion be amended to allow us to be absent on 5 May.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friends, I want to support the sittings motion put forward by the Minister. I should particularly like to commend the opportunities that it gives Conservative Members to contribute to this important Bill as it affects Scotland. On 12 May
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0760">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
Conservative Members should be given the opportunity to return to Scotland and speak to the Scottish Conservative party. The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker), who has already said that he always contributes to the work of Committees, can return to Scotland and explain to his party the work that he does in this place on its behalf. Perhaps he could also explain the way in which he voted last night on the poll tax. The Government's majority was slashed and on the radio this morning the Secretary of State for the Environment claimed that he would persist with the poll tax because of the electoral mandate that that measure had in the recent election. The hon. Member for Tayside, North knows that there is no such mandate for the poll tax in Scotland. He will have a hard job to justify it when he returns there on 12 May.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is wandering from the sittings motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept your ruling entirely, Mr. Knox.<br><br>
The sittings motion allows contributions from Conservative Members, and I assume that they have quite a lot to offer, particularly the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart). Like many members of the Committee, he not only has a Scottish connection, but a Dundee connection. His father was a head teacher at Dundee high school, the only fee-paying school in Dundee. Therefore, the hon. Member for Eastwood is bound to have a prejudiced attitude towards fee-paying schools. No doubt he supports such schools and will take the opportunity provided by the Bill to debate the role of fee-paying and private schools in Scotland. The hon. Gentleman also attended the Bell Baxter high school in Cupar, a state school. Like many hon. Members, that gives him insight into the running of Scottish education at the chalk face. I accept that the hon. Gentleman was a pupil at that school a long time ago.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
The hon. Member for Eastwood also attended St. Andrews university, again an experience that he has in common with many members of the Committee. In mitigation I plead that liberal or even Left-wing people also went to that university. I did. It is to my eternal shame that the name of St. Andrews university is blackened by its association with such people as the hon. Members for Stirling and for Eastwood. St. Andrews university has produced many worthwhile people although those are not on the Conservative Benches. It is a fine university.<br><br>
We can expect the hon. Member for Eastwood to contribute to the work of the Committee. In an earlier Parliament, the hon. Gentleman made his name on Scottish education when he intervened in a debate on one of the Scottish education Bills. He attempted to have "incompetent" teachers sacked. The hon. Gentleman did not explain how he would define "incompetence" in teaching. It is easy to define "incompetence" in the contributions made in Committee. I say that with no great experience, but I sat on the Committee that considered the Housing
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
(Scotland) Bill. It would be "incompetent" to be elected by the people of Scotland to come here and serve on an important Bill, but to sit through 100 hours of the discussion of that Bill without contributing one word, as the hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) did. I am probably being unfair to that hon. Gentleman. He contributed one or two words—"Aye" and "No" on Divisions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Maclean <span class='memberconstituency'>(Penrith and The Border)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Three words, he also mentioned "Chair" during that Bill. The hon. Gentleman has already spoken more on this Bill than he did during the 100 hours of the Housing (Scotland) Bill.<br><br>
I was delighted to hear that the hon. Member for Dorset, South (Mr. Bruce) was a scout master. I was not so delighted to hear his attempt to play dirty by trying to taint my hon. Friend the Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) as being unfit to sit on the Committee because he is English.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not suggest that an Englishman should not serve on the Committee. Some Opposition Members are ringing Scottish newspapers suggesting that I am an English Member of Parliament, which I am not, and that, because of that, I am not a suitable person to serve on the Committee. I dispute that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting to hear the hon. Gentleman dissociate himself from England, and no doubt also from Dorset, South by saying that he is not an English Member of Parliament. I am pleased to say that I am a Scottish Member of Parliament. In the context of the Committee, a Scottish Member of Parliament is defined as someone who is elected by Scottish constituents to serve a Scottish constituency. That is the objection, not where a person has been born.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will recall that the last "Bruce" that tried to interfere in Scottish affairs was a French nobleman, and they made him king.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a fair point. Not only was that Bruce who interfered in Scottish affairs a Frenchman and a Norman, but he was present at the execution of our patriot William Wallace, and supported that execution. History is sometimes bunk, especially as portrayed by the Scottish National Party on occasions.<br><br>
I am delighted to see Conservative Members contributing to the Committee and I hope that the right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) will contribute, he spoke eloquently on Second Reading, and he has contributed to the press and the media in the run-up to the legislation. He has made clear his attitude to the Minister's original proposals. I quote from an article that the right honourable Gentleman wrote in <i>The Press and Journal.</i> The extract reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"To have a head teacher on a board which has executive power over his school and for the head teacher to have no vote on that board, makes absolutely no sense in organisational or management terms."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0761">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
That is a valid and fair point, and I am sure that the Minister will examine closely the clauses that could enable that to happen in schools where school boards have executive powers. The Minister went on to say—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is ahead of everyone else. He is now discussing the contents of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am distressed if I gave that impression, Mr. Knox. I was merely trying to show that the sittings motion gives Conservative Members an opportunity to express opinions that they have already made known to the people of Scotland.<br><br>
The right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) has made known his opposition to ceiling powers, but ceiling powers are implicit in the Bill and I look forward to his contributions.<br><br>
My main reason for supporting the sittings motion is that it gives the Committee time to debate the full implications of the Bill and to examine what was said on Second Reading. I am sad that the Secretary of State for Scotland visited the Committee for only a few minutes before leaving in a hurried fashion. I wanted to ask him about some remarks that he made on Second Reading when he maligned many people who are members of school councils. He said that
<br><blockquote><p>"relatively few parents of real ability have been drawn to serving on school councils."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 12 April 1988; Vol. 131, c.31.]</p></blockquote>
I served on a school council as a parent member before being elected to the regional council and subsequently to Parliament, so I know something about the work of school councils in Dundee. I know that the ability of parents on those councils far exceeds that of Conservative Members of the Committee. That is why I consider that the leading Scottish politician has insulted and maligned members of school councils. I thought that he would use the opportunity given by the sittings motion to apologise to them.<br><br>
The sittings motion also gives us an opportunity to examine the possibility of opting out, as my hon. Friend for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) suggested. The Secretary of State for Scotland anticipated that possibility on Second Reading and spent a great deal of time discussing it. I believe that the Committee will be concerned with opting out. We should take our time and examine the matter closely.<br><br>
It was stated recently in a book about the Educational Institute of Scotland that
<br><blockquote><p>"it is important to the success of comprehensive education that there should be a parity of esteem among schools and this objective will not be served if some schools offer a restricted curriculum or place undue emphasis on one of the three levels at the expense of the other two."</p></blockquote>
We should examine the full implications of opting out and its impact on other schools in the same area. The sittings motion provides a convenient opportunity to do that.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
I know that the major work undertaken by a Minister in the Committee that considered the Housing (Scotland) Bill was that which was performed by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton). I look forward to the contributions of the other Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth). In January, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The whole thrust of our education policy since we took office has been directed towards giving parents a better deal from the services which most of them use and for which most of them pay as ratepayers and taxpayers."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 12 January 1988; Vol. 131, c. 110.]</p></blockquote>
The sittings motion gives him the opportunity to justify that statement. How does he justify spending an unknown sum in setting up school boards and a postal ballot system while he is a member of a Government who have severely restricted the capital allocations available to regional councils to spend on schools?<br><br>
On Friday I was in a school in Dundee where the English department, the business studies department and another department were housed in a Terrapin block next to the school. There were no toilets or proper facilities and it was almost dangerous for the pupils in those schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's enthusiasm to get on with the detail of the Bill but he has jumped quite a way ahead of the rest of us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You are very proper to call me back to order, Mr. Knox. I am a new Member so I sometimes stray from the point.<br><br>
If we are properly to debate all the implications of the Bill, the Minister, in particular, must be given a substantial amount of time to debate it. I look forward to the Minister's answers to all the various points which may arise. We debated the implications of the parents' charter on Second Reading, and I hope that the sittings motion will allow us to debate that again.</span></p>
<p>[SIR HECTOR MONRO <i>in the Chair.</i>]</p>
<p>I am pleased to see the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro) take the Chair. I am sure that he will make the same contribution as he did from the Conservative Benches. He will remain impartial throughout until it comes to a vote.</p>
<p>It is important for the Minister to take the time offered by the sittings motion to debate fully the detailed content of the Bill and its implications, which go much further than some might assume. The Bill has excited much comment in Scotland and has received much attention in the press and the media. I hope that we shall have the opportunity to debate some of the issues that have been raised in the Scottish press. For example, Bob Crampsey, a sports reporter on Saturday afternoon on BBC Radio Scotland who is also a head teacher, has carefully considered the proposals in the Bill. He wrote that there is a real danger that the parents' majority on school boards, suggested by the Minister, could lead to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0762">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"a Caledonian branch of the Harper Valley PTA being formed. 'Her skirts are too short, he does not wear a tie, he voted Tory last time.' Or voted Labour—"</p></blockquote></p>
<p>They may well be the sort of questions that will be raised by school boards that are set up with a parents' majority under the present proposals.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend mentioned Bob Crampsey. He is now in an impartial position in Scotland because he has retired from his post. He is looking at education from the outside and is therefore able to give it the objectivity which some would say would be missing if he were in education. His comments are even more profound now. He was in education all his life and he now looks at it from the outside.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept my hon. Friend's point. Bob Crampsey knows a great deal about education. When I went to St. Augustine's comprehensive school in Milton in Glasgow—the first comprehensive in Scotland—Bob Crampsey was a teacher there. I never had the privilege of being taught by him personally although my elder brother did. He was a great teacher then. He knows a great deal about education whereas, it could be argued, the Minister knows little about it. Perhaps Bob Crampsey should be listened to more closely than the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that Bob Crampsey's retirement coincided with the appointment of the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) to his present position?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That may well be cause and effect. Certainly those who genuinely believe in Scottish education are deeply depressed by his appointment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will the hon. Gentleman bear in mind that Mr. Bob Crampsey is not a member of this Committee. There will be plenty of opportunities for him to deploy Mr. Crampsey's well-known expertise in education later in our proceedings. He must now return to the sittings motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept your point, Sir Hector. I shall certainly try to direct my remarks to the sittings motion. I hope that it will allow us the opportunity broadly to consider a range of opinion. Certainly we do not have a representative body of Scots in this Room. We are elected to represent people, but with our background and knowledge of education we probably represent only a small portion of the total picture in Scotland. I hope that we shall take advantage of the sittings motion to reflect accurately what the people of Scotland are saying about the Bill and the thrust of the Government's policy.<br><br>
All shades of opinion in Scotland are concerned about the Bill. The Church of Scotland has made clear that it is concerned about the Bill, which it regards as potentially divisive between parents and teachers, and bad for education in Scotland. In particular it has criticised the proposal for a parent-majority on every school board. I hope that we shall have an opportunity to debate that. I hope that for once all Conservative Members will contribute to the debate on the Bill, as
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
will all Opposition Members. Only by contributing can we hope to improve the proposed legislation, which greatly needs improving.</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Lewis Moonie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kirkcaldy)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to raise a point of order, Sir Hector, but hesitate to do so while you have so generously taken the Chair for Mr. Knox. I took the Chair on an occasion when a Chairman on another Committee had to leave the Room, and I know how I would have felt if someone had raised a point of order while I was the temporary Chairman. However, you have more experience than myself, Sir Hector, you may be able to assist me.<br><br>
The notices outside the Committee Room are wrong. They refer to a Scottish Standing Committee and to the School Boards (Education) Bill [Lords]. As far as I know, this Bill has not been to another place. Scores of people have come into the House of Commons today purely to see us and hear debating this measure, and they have been enticed in under false pretences. Should we adjourn while the matter is clarified?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, we shall not adjourn. IT there is an incorrect designation on the board, we can correct it before our next sitting. We shall proceed now with the sittings motion.</span></p>
<p>[MR. KNOX <i>in the Chair.</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for such minute attention to detail, Mr. Knox, which is perhaps out of place in the friendly spirit in which the debate has been conducted so far. I say "debate", which implies hon. Members speaking on both sides of the Question, although so far there has been little opposition to the proposal that we sit on Tuesdays and Thursday mornings with the exception of 12 May.<br><br>
I have had a great deal of experience of sittings motions. In my short time here I think that I have seen almost everything that can happen on one. I have even seen the Government defeated on such a motion on the Firearms Bill. I understand that that is almost unprecedented. It was a sign of the opposition felt by many Conservative Members to the Bill, including the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro). The hon. Gentleman voted with us on that occasion to the great embarrassment of a Minister not noted for his self-effacing nature, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Grantham (Mr. Hogg).<br><br>
I have also experienced the opposite end of the spectrum on the Committee on the Abortion (Amendment) Bill, which was given permission to sit on three full days for unlimited time. I am glad that the Minister has not suggested such a procedure for this Bill, although it is an important measure, which will have profound effects on the administration of Scottish schools. It deserves measured consideration. It will certainly be more interesting than the conference that will take place on 12 May.<br><br>
Like all politicians, Conservative Members will be eager to parade their talents before the multitude of the

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
faithful who attend such gatherings. It is probably the only occasion of the year on which they can do so in Scotland. In my area, from which you also come, Mr. Knox—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I come from Dumfries-shire.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is your misfortune, Mr. Knox, and Fife's loss. In my area, the Conservative party has been reduced to advertising for candidates in local elections; I almost felt like applying myself. Conservative Members in Fife may know the area a little better than the advertising agent.<br><br>
I had an interesting experience many years ago when a close friend—although, alas, he is misguided as he is a member of the Conservative party—told me proudly that he had been selected to fight for the Fife seat. Naturally, I was delighted for him, until he said that the seat was Ballingry. I asked my friend, who is English—I do not hold that against him—whether he had ever been to Ballingry. He had to confess that he had not, so I suggested that he visit it. He withdrew his candidature the next day, which was scarcely surprising.<br><br>
I am discussing a legitimate part of the sittings motion—that the Committee should not sit on 12 May. I wish to confine my remarks to that proposal and to work out whether such an exception should be made. Having considered it, I have decided that the matter is important, because on 12 May the Conservative party will debate the Scottish Assembly. Given the growing opposition in the Conservative party in Scotland to the Government's position regarding a Scottish Assembly, clearly the measure is important and all Conservative Members of the Committee wish to be present.<br><br>
I see that I have driven out most of the audience from the public gallery.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It does not exist.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank you, Mr. Knox, for reminding me of that matter. Like many of my hon. Friends, I am relatively new to the House and Committee work. It is difficult to understand that the public gallery does not exist. I could almost imagine that the right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) does not exist. He is so far away that I have great difficulty in picking him out in the mirk at the other side of the Room. Perhaps I should get my eyes tested before the new charges are introduced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside may exist, but the Minister wishes that he did not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take that good point. I shall have my eyes examined while eye tests are free. I am Scottish enough to appreciate the value of that, even if Conservative Members are not.<br><br>
More important than 12 May, as my hon. Friend rightly said—</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We may have jumped to the wrong conclusion about 12 May. I cannot remember whether the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Stirling, said that the reason for not meeting on 12 May was the Tory party conference. An Argentinian battleship involved in the Falklands dispute was called the 12th of May. Does the reason why we are not meeting on that day have something to do with that dispute?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suspect, Mr. Knox, that I should be trying your patience if I were to respond to that interesting intervention. Perhaps a Conservative Member will refer to it in the course of his brief remarks on the sittings motion.<br><br>
A more important day in Scotland is 5 May, and I am surprised that the Minister has not recognised that fact. The hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean)—who has an English constituency, although, from the sound of his voice, he is as entitled to call himself Scottish as anybody here—may not realise the significance of the elections in Scotland. In England, a far lower proportion of seats is fought than in Scotland. I understand that in England only a certain number of seats fall due every time that there is an election, whereas in Scotland they all fall due. I should like Scotland to return to the English system of regular elections for councils. I think that that would be to the benefit of democracy, but I shall let it pass as I do not want to stray too far from the sittings motion.<br><br>
I believe that 5 May is the most important day on which the Committee will be sitting. Surely Conservative members of the Committee will want to be in Scotland on that day to support the huge army of candidates that they have enticed to fight hopeless seats on their behalf. Although, fortunately, Conservative Members will not be defending their seats on 5 May, they will want to be present in body and spirit.<br><br>
That is an oversight by the Minister. Consider poor John Mackay, who has had a difficult time in the past year. He has had to adjust to the loss of his position in the House of Commons, and is obviously building up his spirits to fight to return. He has been given an important job, although I did not see that it had been advertised. I assume that it was done through the usual channels and awarded on the grounds of ability, common sense, hard work and—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Loss of seat.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I can think of a few other potential candidates who have been overlooked in the largesse that the Scottish Conservative party has handed out.<br><br>
Mr. Mackay has pronounced that the Conservative party in Scotland will be fighting on its record on 5 May, a day on which, sadly, the Committee will be sitting, thus depriving us all of the chance to give our support. The Conservatives will be fighting on their record on the poll tax, the National Health Service, social security and a host of other matters so dear to the hearts of the Scottish people on which the Conservative party has such an excellent record. Surely Conservative
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0764">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
Members can see their way to spending that one day in Scotland helping their colleagues at local level to explain their record to the people whom they are expecting, rather over optimistically, to support them.<br><br>
Many key areas that Conservative Members represent are involved. The conference will take place in Perth on 12 May where the Conservatives have lost their majority on the district council, but they are hoping to get it back.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Only one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One can be a lot. It may be four or five after the next district elections, especially if Conservative Members do not attend to lend political weight to the struggle.<br><br>
Two Conservative Members on this Committee represent seats in Edinburgh—the Secretary of State for Scotland and his junior colleague, the Under-Secretary of State. They represent vast swathes of the district council, which is one of the key Conservative targets. Will they not be present on 5 May?<br><br>
Stirling council is on a knife-edge. I suspect that it may slip off on to our side on 5 May, and I am sure that the people of Stirling will be grateful for that. The Conservative party has been losing ground in Dumfries and Nithsdale. The list is endless, apart from the areas in which the Conservatives have no ground left to lose.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about Eastwood?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to Eastwood shortly, if only to point out that every barrel has one rotten apple. The people of Eastwood are just a little behind the rest of Scotland in their appreciation of what the Opposition have done for them. Given time, I am sure that we shall persuade the people of Eastwood of the rights of our cause.<br><br>
Fortunately, only a small number of my Labour colleagues are on this Committee. The vast majority of them will be in Scotland on 5 May, when we shall be considering the Bill in Committee, unless the force of our logic and power of our rhetoric is enough to persuade the Minister that we should not sit on that day. We have plenty of hon. Members to carry our cause, but, sadly, that is not the case with Conservative Members, who must all attend so that the Committee meets the Standing Orders governing Scottish legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an interesting point, but I was alarmed by a sedentary remark by a Conservative Member, whom I shall not identify, who said something that sounded like "evening sittings". I am sure that my hon. Friend will want to reinforce the fact that we support the sittings motion.</span></p>
<p>11.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With the exception of 5 May, I wholeheartedly support the sitting motions, and I am sorry if I did not make that clear from the outset. It is right that we should give careful consideration to the Bill. It takes time to prepare proper contributions to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
debates, and it is easier to do so if the Committee has only two sittings per week, rather than the excessive number to which some Bills are subjected.<br><br>
I sympathise with Ministers. I should not speak about the right honourable and learned Gentleman in his absence, but I shall do so because he does not take offence readily. The Secretary of State must find the prospect of a more stringent sittings motion extremely irksome because he has so much to do, such as watching his back—particularly with regard to education.<br><br>
I have probably taxed your patience enough, Mr. Knox, about the sittings motion. It is not proper to speak at length as we are not opposing it. I stress merely that I should be grateful if the Minister would allow us the freedom of Thursday 5 May, in addition to 12 May. I have high hopes of taking at least one seat from this party on that day and I am sure that my hon. Friends are all in the same boat. On reflection, I am sure that the Minister will realise that that would be reasonable. I am prepared to give up one afternoon to ensure that that day is kept free, and it would show due respect to the people of Scotland to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Any proposal from my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary is always sound and we should support this motion.<br><br>
Much has been said about the Conservative party and 12 May. The hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie), who spoke about events on 12 May, should remember that the Labour party does not have one seat in my constituency and is unlikely to win any on 5 May. Its candidates are lucky if they save their deposits at general elections. We need no lessons from the Opposition. As they have chosen to speak about their own selected areas, I remind them that on 12 May we expect to go to the conference from north Tayside celebrating again that we have no Labour representatives at any level and are unlikely ever to have any. We look forward to the opportunity on 12 May to celebrate the good results in my constituency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the hon. Gentleman is not a drinking man, certainly not of our national product, but is he given to the odd wager on the outcome of those results?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The way in which I behave and how I live have nothing to do with the hon. Gentleman. I expect that under normal circumstances he and I should enjoy a long and happy life—he because he drinks the product and I because I support it. The effect on both of us will be beneficial. We should proceed with this important Bill, and the sooner the better. I hope that we can start debating the clauses this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I begin by offering an apology. I am a new hon. Member and, while I share the privilege of sitting on three Committees with the hon. Member for Dorset, South, this is a new subject for me. I am meant to be flattering to the Chair at the outset Mr. Knox. I am aware that your tolerance has been stretched and that your patience may run out. I ask only that you extend those two qualities for a few minutes so that I can partake of them.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0765">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) raised the question of parentage. As an hon. Member representing a Scottish constituency I have few skeletons in the proverbial cupboard. It is important to put one's credentials on the table, so I shall reveal that I made a sojourn to England when I signed for Leeds United as a schoolboy professional football player. I did not stay long as I was homesick. I returned to my native north, signed for a small, humble club called East Fife and stayed there for five years. I say that because it is important to put my credentials on the record in case the facts leak out at an inconvenient moment.<br><br>
Ireland is germane to the education debate and the sittings motion. In my dim and distant past I had Irish connections. I remain neutral about that point, but I mention it as the education system in the Republic of Ireland is very interesting. The Republic of Ireland decided to abolish rates to support educational development—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is stretching his remarks well beyond the sittings motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Knox. I am not seeking to challenge your ruling, but my hon. Friend has made an interesting point by drawing attention to the Republic of Ireland. Would it be in order for the Committee to visit the Republic of Ireland to see those provisions at first hand?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Knox. During the debate on the Housing (Scotland) Bill the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn), who is a member of the Committee but is not here today, questioned the credentials of members of the Committee. I and my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galloway) question why we should serve on a Scottish Committee as we both have Irish parentage. May we have a ruling from the Chair that Irish parentage is not a qualification for serving on this Committee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is quite correct.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They were interesting points of order, but I was not declaring any Irish parentage. I said that in the dim and distant past I had Irish connections.<br><br>
In Ireland, the rating system was abolished and all teachers became civil servants. In view of the vote in the House yesterday, the Government may be looking for alternatives. If so, they should examine the education system in Ireland, which has resulted from the abolition of rates. However, I shall move on before you rise again, Mr. Knox.<br><br>
I had a meeting last night which was germane to the sittings motion. I mention that because my enthusiasm and excitement overnight mean that I must give vent to my feelings. I met the Prime Minister last night. I thought that that would draw such gasps. I was standing at the Bar of the Chamber at 11.15 pm with
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
my wife and parents. I shook the Prime Minister's hand and introduced myself, which is, I believe, more than some Conservative Members have done.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: She was looking for the Mace.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall ignore the temptation to respond to that comment.<br><br>
The Prime Minister commented on the litter in the House, which resulted from the emotion and excitement of last night's debate. She said that she was extremely worried about the mess left by hon. Members. I responded by saying that it was important for her to bring a litter campaign from an adjacent park into the House of Commons, and she agreed that she would take that idea away.<br><br>
I mention the Prime Minister because I had no time to discuss Scottish education with her. Her detective—a large man—was standing beside her and wanted to move her on. I am aware that over the past few months she has developed an extraordinary interest in what happens to the proposals for Scottish education proposed by the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth).<br><br>
What links will be built up between this Committee and No. 10 Downing street to ensure that Government action is in full accord with the Prime Minister's wishes for Scottish education? I do not want to do anything to upset the Prime Minister, and I am sure that that sentiment is shared by my hon. Friends. If Scottish education is important enough for the Prime Minister to take a personal interest, we shall upset the delicate balance between the Scottish Ministers, the Whips' Office and No. 10 Downing street. The Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Stirling, might say what electronic communication or other links are available to ensure that the work of the House does not upset the Prime Minister. I make that point sincerely, as someone who values the importance of Scottish education and is delighted to note Mrs Thatcher's extraordinary interest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman must not refer by name to hon. Members, other than myself and Mr. McWilliam.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Links are vital to our work.<br><br>
We have talked about 5 May and 12 May. In view of the subject matter, the Government could consider sitting only on Tuesdays. The subject is so important that we might want to discuss at greater length, in a more informal environment, some of the implications of the measures. I say that in passing and shall not take it further.<br><br>
The sittings motion is crucial to how we shall structure our work over the next few weeks and possibly months. I am a parent as well as a politician. My younger son, who is 14, attends a school run by Fyfe regional council education authority, which is one of the most progressive education authorities in Europe, as are most of the Labour-controlled regional councils in Scotland that administer education.<br><br>
The Bill is about parental power in education, which is an interesting and important subject. My son attends
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0766">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
a comprehensive school in Scotland. Tonight he will discuss with his teachers the subjects he will study for the next two years to gain his certificates. He benefits from one of the finest education services that are available. If we are to change that approach dramatically, it is crucial that as many hon. Members as possible are present for every sitting.<br><br>
That is why my hon. Friends have spoken about 5 May. For the sake of democracy—I am sure that that is still a subject close to the hearts of Conservative Members—we want to participate and assist in local elections. You may say, Mr. Knox, that there is no need for five Labour Members—including the hon. Member for Kirkaldy (Dr. Moonie)—to be in Scotland when Labour has such majorities and rules virtually every district council in the industrial heartlands of Scotland. We should be there in the interests not of the Labour party but democracy.<br><br>
I hope that when the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Stirling, replies to the sittings motion, he will take seriously the points that have been made about 5 May and respond accordingly.<br><br>
I suspect that you are coming to the end of your patience and tolerance, Mr. Knox. I am glad that you extended those two qualities, which I mentioned at the start of my contribution, and I look forward to a long and happy involvement with this Committee, and I hope that we will be allowed to make sense of a nonsensical measure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gordon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have an embarrassment of riches with two Bruces on one Committee. I am sure that Robert would have been proud of us, although he may have been prouder of my defence of Scotland than that of the hon. Member for Dorset, South (Mr. Bruce).<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
I do not wish to prolong the debate. I am anxious to debate the 14 amendments and one new clause that I tabled, but I was astonished that the Minister moved such a sittings motion. I do not wish to spoil the bonhomie that has developed over the past hour and a half, but it is impertinent to ask the Committee to agree not to sit on one day for the convenience of the Conservative party conference when it is expected to sit on the day of local elections. The demonstration of democracy in action on 5 May seems a more important and relevant reason to adjourn the Committee than the Conservative party conference. The Minister knows that hon. Members play significant roles in supporting candidates in local elections.<br><br>
I may be speaking against the interests of my party because the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Stirling, said that four years ago his personal intervention in Bridge of Allan prevented my good friend Mrs Barbara Dean from taking the seat from the Conservatives. She is standing again on 5 May, so it may be in my interests to ensure that the hon. Member for Stirling is not present. Nevertheless, most of us are genuinely committed to local elections.<br><br>
Some hon. Members may recall a former Member for East Aberdeenshire, Patrick Wolridge Gordon. He
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
has decided to raise his ambitions and stand as Conservative candidate for the district council of Gordon. That possibly reflects his territorial ownership of part of the constituency. I am not sure whether it is appropriate, but it shows some of the problems faced by Conservatives fighting local elections that Mr. Wolridge Gordon has told a local newspaper that he did not wish to stand. He said that his arm was twisted by the local Conservative Association and that he had no pretensions of winning. That is helpful to our candidate.<br><br>
The Bill is important and numerous important amendments have been tabled. If the Minister is unable to say something about 5 May, the day of the local elections, I am not sure how I shall vote on the motion. It would have been appropriate to move a sittings motion to sit Tuesday and Thursday mornings and leave other matters for negotiation as the Committee proceeds. Given that the Minister has said that 12 May should be set aside for the convenience of Ministers, it would be appropriate to set aside 5 May so that we know from the outset where we stand and can plan accordingly. It would be most unfortunate if hon. Members who have tabled amendments have to decide between being in Committee or in Scotland to promote the local elections.<br><br>
I am a member of the Select Committee on Trade and Industry, which meets Wednesday mornings and afternoons. I have already advised that Committee that I shall be unable to take part in their briefing in Brussels, because of meetings next week. I have another constraint, with which I would not dream of detaining the Committee, because the Prince of Wales is visiting my constituency next week to open the welcome development of a new oilfield.<br><br>
All hon. Members have particular problems with which it is not necessary to detain the Committee, but it is impertinent for the Government to expect their political problems to be sorted out in advance but not the issue of the local election. I hope that the Minister will modify his motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to ask whether my hon. Friend thinks that we should sit more rather than less often. It is strange that Opposition Members should suggest that they can do anything about local election results on 5 May, when people are voting rather than being canvassed. So far it has taken one hour and 35 minutes to discuss the sittings motion, which the Opposition support. It will take even longer if we discuss the inconsistencies of having on the Committee hon. Members who were born in Scotland rather than hon. Members who represent Scottish constituencies.<br><br>
There has been much talk this morning about the relevance of people selected for Committees. Standing Orders make it clear that 16 hon. Members representing Scottish constituencies should be on the Committee. It is sensible that people with experience of sitting on school governing bodies in England and with relevant information to contribute should be on the Committee. I hope that people educated in Scotland and England who have a contribution to make about the two relevant systems would also be welcome to sit on the Committee.<br><br>
Opposition Members suggest that we have all the time in the world, but we should deal urgently with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0767">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
these new measures to give parents in Scotland the same powers that will be available to parents in England and Wales.<br><br>
I do not dispute anyone's right to sit on this Committee, whatever his parentage. I ran a company in Scotland in the Borders, and when people were annoyed by one of my pronouncements and called me a bloody Englishman, I used to say that I was born in Wales of a Scottish father and an Irish mother and that I am many things but not a bloody Englishman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am reluctant to speak again, but I am distressed by the identity crisis of the hon. Member for Dorset, South (Mr. Bruce). We do not challenge the right of the Committee of Selection to appoint whomever it deems appropriate to serve on the Committee. Our point was that Standing Orders require that 16 members of the Committee should be hon. Members representing Scottish constituencies. We would have helped the Government by putting another Labour Member on the Committee or, if they wished, an hon. Member from the Social Liberal and Democratic party or the Scottish National party, which is not represented on the Committee. We would have been flexible.<br><br>
The Committee has selected an hon. and learned Member who is ill and who will have on his record the fact that he was summoned to X number of Committee sittings but did not attend any of them. That is unfair to the hon. and learned Gentleman. However, we can do nothing to help the hon. Member for Dorset, South, who has an identity crisis. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie), who specialised in psychiatry before becoming an hon. Member, will gladly assist in any way that he can.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McFall <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to support the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Cumberland and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) about the identity crisis of the hon. Member for Dorset, South (Mr. Bruce). The hon. Gentleman missed the point. We do not want to sit on 5 May because we want to record our vote in Scotland. If we are kept down here, we shall not be able to do so in person. The democratic argument is important. Since June 1987, Conservative Members have wanted to brush that democratic argument under the carpet. We do not want to do that. We want to be in Scotland on that day. We have been flexible on that matter. The hon. Gentleman may want 12 May, but we want 5 May.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But we agree.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We agree to the sittings motion. It has already been pointed out that we do not need to consider the Bill with haste. We shall sit only Tuesday and Thursday mornings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This week.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Do I detect some secret agenda?<br><br>
As the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), moved the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
motion, it must be taken on good faith. We consider the sittings motion to be for Tuesdays and Thursdays, mornings only, until the Committee finishes. We should like that to be the case.<br><br>
Since the consultation paper was issued last year, there has been widespread debate in Scotland. As has been said, 7,500 responses have been received. It is important that Members discussing the matter can have a channel for relating information back to Scotland to ferment the debate in Scotland.<br><br>
The Bill is important. Local authorities teaching unions, voluntary organisations and churches are anxious about it. They want to know who is in charge of the Scottish Office. That is the question on everybody's lips in Scotland. I suggest that perhaps the Under-Secretary includes a provision to allow some of our sittings to take place in Scotland. That would put extra focus on the Bill. Perhaps we should have an inbuilt disadvantage if there were such an arrangement. The Under-Secretary would have the authority of the Tory party behind him, and John Mackay would be ready to pump out his message. However, we are willing to risk that in the name of democracy and to get the message across to the Scottish people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are evangelical.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Exactly, evangelical. That has been the message since the consultation paper was issued. As the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) said, he has tabled some amendments. We have tabled 53 amendments and we do not want to sit on 5 May. Neither do we want to miss any important aspects of the Bill. The Scottish education system is distinctive. Will the Under-Secretary consider seriously allowing us not to sit on 5 May as well as 12 May?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting discussion. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) for supporting me in what he described as a new precedent. Agreeing to a motion that I proposed is perhaps also a new precedent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should not want the Under-Secretary to think that we support the motion overwhelmingly. He suggests that we meet every Tuesday. That is a little over the top.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Every time I say that I agree with the hon. Gentleman, he backs off. I understand why.<br><br>
I have listened carefully to the arguments about 5 May and the local elections. Like the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce), I should also like to be involved in the election campaign. However, it is difficult to support the view that the Committee should not sit on that day if we continue to take up time that we could otherwise spend discussing some of the interesting amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth. The hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) may be keen to vote in person, but he could take advantage of the postal vote system to cast his vote on 5 May.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is too late.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Labour party in Scotland is supposed to be very organised. My agent organised my postal vote in anticipation of my being unable to do so. The hon. Gentleman should have taken similar steps.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can suggest a solution to the Minister's dilemma. If the Committee met in Scotland on 5 May we could vote while we were up there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) is very reasonable, but I must not get involved in matters that are not for me. If we made some progress I know that my hon.

The hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth has assembled around him not only the crème de la crème of the Opposition in Scotland but the House as a whole. I should have thought that he would be anxious to allow the Committee to benefit from their talents in putting forward the various suggestions contained in the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must remind the Minister that we support his motion. He must not endanger that support by making asides. We are anxious and willing to get on and to be constructive, I an sure that we will be able to prove that before this morning is out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Gentleman's strictures as I do not want to inject a note of disharmony into our discussions.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We tabled the amendments because we were concerned that the Government appeared to be departing from a terminology that had become understood in Scotland a long time ago, and they played a valuable part in sustaining the principle of education being available to every child in Scotland. We do not deny that they did a good job in their day, but events have moved on and education authorities have assumed the role that school boards fulfilled.<br><br>
A consensus has grown up in Scotland that those best able to administer education are elected local authorities, with specific powers as education authorities enabling them to act in certain matters. Those are important factors in the structure of education in Scotland, around which a consensus has emerged.<br><br>
It is important to sustain that consensus. We feel strongly about some aspects of this Bill, which is why we tabled a reasoned amendment and voted only for that reasoned amendment. It is must be understood that on that occasion we were reaffirming the view that parents have a distinct and important role in the education system which should be developed. We have reservations because we are worried that this may be a paving measure. That is how the Prime Minister appears to regard it, according to an interview on Scottish television.<br><br>
Therefore, it is important to determine at the beginning of the Committee's proceedings that the terminology used is part of the development of education in Scotland and is understood by parents and teachers—the two important groups involved in the management of schools and education. For that reason, use of the term "Board" will reintroduce into the language of Scottish education a word that dropped out because it had served its time.<br><br>
The Minister may say that Victorian times produced certain values and that there is a case for returning to them. That may be true, but the school board had a connotation appropriate for that time, but which is not appropriate now. We want to withdraw that term and use instead the widely understood word "Council".<br><br>

I accept that school councils have not been a great success, but the fact that they were called school councils was not a contributory factor to their fall into disuse, which has happened in some local authorities. In my constituency—this has nothing to do with me—school councils are a considerable success. There is competition to serve on the two councils and much interest in the appointment of their chairmen. Their affairs are reported in detail in the local newspaper and they have the benefit of the services of good people in education, such as Mr. Douglas Gilchrist, who is a member of the general teaching council and a district councillor. He has a far wider experience of education than a teacher, parent or someone merely interested and he is able to bring that experience to the school council on which he serves as a district council representative.<br><br>
The Minister rightly said that school councils have not succeeded in some places partly because we have not given them proper functions, to which they can relate and in which they can develop an interest. However, we challenge the extent to which he was prepared to go, which we did not consider appropriate, as shown in the 7,500 responses to which my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) referred.<br><br>
It is important to get the terminology right from the beginning. We know from leaked letters that the School Boards (Scotland) Bill is an unfortunate title. I do not know where these letters come from, but they are much more interesting than the ones we get in our mail every day. I do not know how that happens, but I shall talk to my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell), who has an understanding of these matters. I noticed that he was here this morning looking somewhat like the pied piper of Hamelin with a large group of youngsters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman did not notice the hon. Member here, because the public gallery does not exist.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You are so right, Mr. Knox. It is ridiculous to think that the public gallery exists, and I understand that. The hon. Member for Linlithgow understands how letters and documents emerge into what is euphemistically called the public domain—a phrase that we hear all the time.<br><br>
Among letters that emerged recently between the Cabinet Office and the Scottish Office were some that drew our attention to the fact that next year—this is good news—we shall have an Education (Scotland) Bill. It is fortunate that we shall all meet here again to discuss that Bill. It is unfortunate that that measure will be the "son of Education Reform Bill"—the Scottish son of the Education Reform Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A wee gem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A wee gem indeed. That Bill may be a consequence of this measure. The Minister has a duty to reassure us that this measure is not a paving measure, although I do not think that he will be able to do so.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
I hope that the Minister will understand my argument about the word "Board". It is interesting that the Government do not like the term "Board" when it is applied to anything else. They do not like electricity or gas boards, which they have sold, they much prefer a term such a "company".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Coal boards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government do not like coal boards either, and the National Coal Board had to become British Coal, except for those under the South of Scotland Electricity Board, which is called Polish Coal.<br><br>
A school board is not an appropriate term to describe what we are proposing to set up. People have not thought in terms of boards since the 1920s.<br><br>
I attended an excellent school in Aberdeen called Causewayend school, which had "Aberdeen school board" carved in granite above the door in letters about two feet high. The term "school board" is taking us back into the past. It would be better if they were called schools councils.<br><br>
The Minister might say that he does not wish that term to be used, as by and large school councils have not been a success. That is not because of what they are called, but because we do not have the right balance of functions for school councils. That has dogged the matter from the outset.<br><br>
In the last regional elections which were fought in 1986—my hon. Friend the Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) will correct me if I am wrong, as he was a candidate then—Strathclyde regional council Labour party fought the election on a published manifesto. It said that it would seek to set up a school council for each school and develop the powers of school councils because it recognised that they had not been as successful as was hoped when they were first introduced.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
None of that lack of success can be attributed to their name; it can be attributed to the fact that there was insufficient interest in what they did. The Minister is right to seek to improve that, but he is wrong in fact in what he seeks to do, although the general objective of improving parents' role and making their task more meaningful is right. Opposition Members—I am sure that I also speak for the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce)—accept that there must be greater parental involvement, but that does not turn on what the organisations are called.<br><br>
Moreover, the word "board" generally applies to a body that is very large. That is why we have the National Coal Board, the electricity board and the gas board. They are national organisations. The term "board" may put some parents off. They may conclude that a school board is too big a body for them to be involved in, as it implies importance. It is rather like being a regional councillor. Parents would rather be members of a school council. Councils are understood to be smaller and local organisations.<br><br>
We are considering setting up 3,200 school boards. That will mean that there will be about 32,000 school
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0770">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
governors. Do Conservative Members realise that that will cost a pretty penny?<br><br>
We have not yet discussed what parents who serve on school boards will be called. Shall we call them "boarders"? The Tories understand that word. Some were boarders at dreadful establishments that present themselves as schools and I am sure that Conservative Members would not want to use that term. The Bill does not suggest a name, but I intend to table a new clause defining what they are to be called.<br><br>
Our amendments to clause 1 have been tabled to establish what the organisation is to be called at the outset so we shall know where we are in regard to the rest of the Bill. I hope that the Minister accepts that I am trying to be reasonable.<br><br>
I do not want to detain the Committee, but the name is important. I hope that the Minister can describe those school boards, tell us whether he is prepared to be flexible and call them something else, and also tell us how we are to describe those who serve on them. Shall we have school governors of the type referred to by the hon. Member for Dorset, South (Mr. Bruce)?<br><br>
I know a little about school governors because my secretary in the House is a former mayor of Camden. She serves in Camden as a school governor and knows a great deal about these matters. I am intrigued to hear about the expensive functions of school boards in Camden schools. I am interested in how they will be described and I look forward to the Minister's reply. My hon. Friends may wish to reinforce my remarks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is good to start the Committee stage with the good will created by the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg). It is useful to have an informal debate at the beginning about whether these organisations should be called school boards, councils or anything else. After all, they will be around for many years and we should get the name right.<br><br>
I appreciate that boards have a place in education, especially in independent schools which have boards of governors. In the distant past, church schools had school boards. The feeling is that people are appointed to a board, whereas they are elected to a council. There is a significant difference, and it would be interesting to know the Government's feeling on the matter.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman has rightly said that broadly speaking the school councils have not lived up to expectations. In some areas, such as Dumfries and Galloway, there are only three or four in the whole region. They did not fulfil what was anticipated of them. However, that failure is no reason to ban the name. Instead, that might be a basis on which to reconstitute school councils under different legislation. I shall listen with interest to the other views expressed in the debate, but at this stage I feel that a school council might perhaps sound like a more attractive organisation to belong to than a school board. We should give the matter careful consideration in debating this important legislation.<br><br>
As I said earlier, it is common parlance in education that independent schools have boards of governors. However, we are considering organisations which have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
a very different form of administration from those which currently exist in independent schools.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth mentioned the proposed number of school boards or councils throughout Scotland. I feel considerable concern about the cost of those organisations, whether they will be administered adequately and whether they will fulfil the purpose that is shown in principle in the legislation. Just because broadly speaking school councils may have failed over the past seven, eight or 10 years we should not feel that the name is inappropriate today.<br><br>
I am not pushing anything in any direction. I have a very open mind about the matter, but I should like to know why the Government want the administrative set-up to be called a board and not a council, bearing in mind appointments to boards and elections to councils, and why they believe that it would be more appropriate to the legislation.<br><br>
I have some doubt about calling the organisation a board, but I do not feel strongly about it at present. I should be interested to hear the views of other hon. Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro) made a powerful argument supporting the amendment which Opposition Members have tabled to retain the name of school councils and do away with the name of school boards.<br><br>
I was saddened to hear the hon. Gentleman say that he did not feel very strongly about the matter, after putting forward such a strong argument in its favour. It is important to realise that there is a distinction in the language and that councils and councillors are known to be elected whereas boards and those who sit on them are known to be appointed. Therefore, it is most important to continue with the democratic title of school councils rather than with the undemocratic one of school boards.<br><br>
There are other reasons for supporting our amendment, some of which were mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg). He said that it was important to use a term which is widely understood by the people of Scotland and especially by the parents who will be affected. As the Committee knows, there is often a time lapse between legislative changes which are enacted in Parliament and those changes being fully understood by people in Scotland. I refer, for example, to the changes in the system of local government in Scotland which led to corporations being replaced by regional councils and district councils. As yet, those changes have not been fully appreciated by a number of people in Scotland. I am repeatedly stopped in the street by people who speak about Dundee corporation, which ceased to exist in 1974. They appear not to know about Tayside regional council and Dundee district council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is quite correct and he will know that people in Broughty Ferry still hanker after the old Broughty Ferry administration, which has been out of existence for many, many decades.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0771">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point. I am arguing that school councils are a relatively new concept, even in Scotland. The 1980 Macbeth report on school councils referred to their newness, and they have not been fully understood by all parents. At this stage, when people are beginning to understand the words "school councils", it would be silly to move in a completely new direction by introducing a new term which will take even longer for people to understand.<br><br>
There are other reasons for continuing with the term "school councils", and one of them is to recognise the worthwhile role which they have played since their inception in Scotland just over a decade ago. There have been references to the failure of school councils, and on Second Reading the Secretary of State attacked school council members. If school councils have failed, it is not because of the work which is undertaken by the parents and teachers elected to them and the councillors and others who sit on them. They give up a great deal of their time in their commitment to those councils and they work extremely hard.<br><br>
In my area of Tayside, a magnificent campaign was fought against the Tory regional council's programme of school closures which closed primaries in Dundee. The school councils were in the forefront of that campaign and they fought a marvellous rearguard action in trying to defend their schools. Unfortunately, they were unsuccessful because the Tory regional council did not listen to them and went ahead with the closures. However, it paid the price at the ballot box in the election that followed in 1986.<br><br>
Therefore, school councils are worthwhile institutions in their own right. If they have failed, it is because Parliament and the Ministers responsible have never given them the sort of constructive role that would enable them genuinely to be involved in Scottish education. If there was failure, it occurred here in the House of Commons and not in the school councils in Scotland. It is important to recognise that and to stay with the title of school councils.<br><br>
Another reason for supporting our amendment is that the use of the word "boards" smacks of an importation from England. The Committee knows that the Scottish education system is distinctively different from that which pertains in England, and that reflects the different origins of the two systems. The Scottish system had its origins in Europe, as I said on Second Reading, and it has had a far more democratic tradition ever since the Middle Ages, when it was first introduced into Scotland. For example, the Lad o' Pairts is well known in Scottish mythology, but there is no such equivalent in England where education depends on background, class and income. In Scotland, there was always at least a chink of light to enable people from poor backgrounds to go through the Scottish system of education and make it successful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: By 1696, education had been established in every parish in Scotland but that position was not reached in England until 1870.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a fair point. If I may say so, Mr. Knox, your namesake was largely
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
responsible for the democratic education system that was set up in Scotland at that time.<br><br>
The distinctive tradition of Scottish education must be maintained. Scottish society is far less class ridden than English society. That is reflected in our school system, in which the private sector plays a minor role. The vast majority of Scottish children attend state schools and are very happy to do so.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
I think that only in Edinburgh is the education system distorted and damaged by the private sector. I hope that all members of the Committee are anxious to retain that position and that they do not wish to embark on any road that will lead to an increased role for the private sector in Scottish education at the expense of the public sector and of the 97 per cent of Scottish pupils who attend state schools and are very happy in them.<br><br>
We may well be on a slippery slope. I think that the hon. Member for Dorset, South (Mr. Bruce) has now left the room. Someone said that he has had enough but we have certainly had enough of him this morning. He gave the game away when he referred to his worthiness to serve on the Committee. He based it on his proven worth as a governor of an English school, implying that his English experience would be relevant for setting up school boards in Scotland, that the Government's legislation was really about a slow but steady anglicisation of Scottish education and that the Bill was beginning that process by introducing the board of governors system which has applied in England for a long time, but never in Scotland. We must be careful not to anglicise the Scottish education system.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dumfries said that boards were a known vehicle in the independent, fee-paying sector. That is something about which we must be very wary. It is important to resist the slide towards importing from England ideas and concepts that are essentially alien to Scottish education. In that I do not speak only for myself and the people in Dundee, East; I think that I voice the broad range of opinion in Scotland—certainly that of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, which represents local authorities of all political descriptions. COSLA supports the idea of parental involvement in the Bill, but it does so on the clear understanding that the distinctive nature of the Scottish education system will be maintained. I am sure that there is widespread support for that position in Scotland. People will watch carefully for any attempt to bring in new, alien concepts.<br><br>
Some people may say, "What is in a name?" However, terminology is important as we have already seen when the Government use words that mean exactly the opposite of what they are describing. For example, they say that the poll tax is a fairer way of collecting local government taxes. Even the children who were here this morning understand clearly that the poll tax is unfair. Language is important and sometimes people use it to try to get away with political tricks. It is important that we do not give way on this matter and that we do not accept the word "board" but stick with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0772">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
the word "council". That is the democratic word and it is understood by the people of Scotland. It should apply to the bodies that will play an important and constructive role in Scottish education.<br><br>
I hope that both Opposition and Conservative Members will decide to drop the alien import and stick with the Scottish term "school council".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise to speak to the amendment. For a number of reasons, I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will advise my colleagues to resist it.<br><br>
First, I want to get rid of the myth that we are importing an English system. That is not so because the English bodies that look after schools are the governing bodies. We are talking about something that is historically Scottish. When I was at school, one knew what school boards meant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way? Will he confirm that the system is being imported not from England, but from America?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, it is not. If the hon. Gentleman is a student of history—with his background, he must be—he will know that large sectors of the United States are just 100 years old or less. Indeed, California is less than 100 years old, and school boards existed in Scotland before California existed.<br><br>
However, that is not the only reason why we should reject the amendment. We should reject it because, sadly, councils have politicised schools and we want to change the effect of that. The councils which have done that are mostly Left wing and the result is that many parents are unhappy with the term, "council".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was astonished to hear the hon. Gentleman accuse councils of becoming politicised. Does he deny the fact that the Secretary of State for Education and Science has urged Tories in England and Wales to become involved with boards of governors?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Secretary of State for Scotland must not stand when another member of the Committee is on his feet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You put the fear of death into me, Mr. Knox, as I thought that I had done something wrong.<br><br>
I had concluded my intervention. It is well known that the Secretary of State for Education and Science has urged Tories to become involved with boards of governors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, that is in response to the activities of what has become fashionably known as the loony Left.<br><br>
Several hon. Members <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I answer one intervention before I move on to others?<br><br>
The term, "council", is now associated in the minds of the public at large with that sort of politicisation, wherever it comes from.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that to describe Scottish education as being run by the loony Left is very wide of the mark? Will he also concede that the quality of local authority education throughout Scotland is widely regarded as being among the best that the United Kingdom can offer? Will he reflect on his ill-considered comment about the quality of education provided mainly by Labour-controlled councils?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was an interesting intervention, because I have not yet mentioned the quality of education. If the hon. Gentleman finds the cap fitting for whatever reason, I am sorry if it pinches. I simply said that education has become politicised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to the loony Left.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was referring to councils, with whom the term, "loony Left", is associated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is perhaps better qualified than most to identify loonies. To which authorities does he attribute that term?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I could spend at least three weeks listing the authorities concerned, but I shall not detain the Committee doing so.<br><br>
Opposition Members are touchy and should recollect the recent history of Paisley. If the new school boards are to be set up, they must be accepted by parents and recognised as being vehicles that will bring about the changes in schools that parents want. Some councils have been associated with the politicisation of schools. We already have too many councils—there are community, district and regional councils. It would be wise to recognise that enough councils exist and that school councils do not have the happy history that we would have wished. Any name would be better than school council because councils have not had the results that we would have wished for. Those of us who were at school before the 1939–45 war, such as myself, remember what school boards meant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The 1914–18 war?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am proud of the school that I attended before the war. It was Blackness school in Dundee. It had a fine record and produced many fine scholars. I do not claim to be one of them. I have never claimed to be an academic. Any success that I have had in life has not been in academia, so I speak on behalf of the majority of Scottish parents and children. I represent the majority of them because the majority of Scottish children are not academic.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman in a minute. He seems impetuous. The majority of parents want their children properly to be equipped for the world. That is why the term "board" is probably the right one. It reflects people who have been elected. Contrary to the comments made earlier, most boards

are elected, not appointed. The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) will find that most boards are not appointed. I noted his comment as he said it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was merely agreeing with the point made by the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Munro) in saying that most board people were appointed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's terminology was slightly different, but sufficiently different to change the emphasis and the point. The term "board" is probably the right one because historically it is Scottish and has nothing to do with England or the United States. If the term is used in the United States, it was copied from us. Much of what happened in education there was imported from Scotland by Scots who had emigrated. Therefore, we should respect our long history and traditions, and recognise that "school boards" is the right term and that they contain the right people. I shall resist calling them councils.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) made an interesting point which his colleagues may not fully have appreciated when he said that he represents the majority of parents and children in Scotland. I am sure that that will stop them in their tracks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that by that definition only half the people are below average intelligence?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 40</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That raises a serious point. If the hon. Gentleman supports the legislation and is in favour of school boards being taken over by those who represent the majority, he will be content if they use that majority to lower the academic standards and ambitions of schools to the level of the average which he seeks to represent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must be aware that of the numerous children who leave school at the age of 16, the majority are not academic. One would expect that the majority of parents on any board would reflect that majority purely on the basis of numbers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Nevertheless, my point stands.<br><br>
One of the dilemmas faced by some of us was the abolition of junior secondary schools in most areas in favour of giving all children an equal opportunity to achieve the maximum. The hon. Gentleman seems to represent a view that goes back to that era. Some people wished to do that, but the hon. Gentleman should recognise that an academic debate took place around that matter which many of us felt was behind us.</span></p>
