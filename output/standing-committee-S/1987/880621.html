	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [16 June],</i> No. 2, in page 1, line 12, to leave out the word "solely"—[	<i>Mr. Dewar.</i>]</p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are discussing amendment No. 3, in page 1, leave out lines 18 to 21.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling) raised an important point about no fault compensation, on which I can give some up-to-date details. The introduction of no fault compensation was examined by the Royal Commission on Civil Liability and Compensation for Peronal Injury, which reported in 1978. The commission reported that there would be serious difficulties in designing and administering such a scheme and concluded that it should not be introduced. The recent report by the review body on civil justice, which was published on 9 June 1988 and applies exclusively to England and Wales, discussed the possibility of no fault compensation in paragraph 456. It recommended that in consultation with the insurance industry, my noble Friend the Lord Chancellor should consider a no fault scheme that would be restricted to less serious road accidents and financed by private insurance. That recommendation, together with the other wide-ranging recommendations made in the report, is being considered by my noble Friend the Lord Chancellor and if such a scheme proves feasible and desirable, it may be appropriate to consider similar arrangements for Scotland. I shall be in close touch with my noble Friend the Lord Chancellor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Garscadden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his courtesy in giving us that information. It is interesting that the work is being done in the Lord Chancellor's Department. I hope that we are keeping a Scottish eye on it, as we do not need to follow blindly. I do not want to deal in too much detail with no fault compensation, but I shall certainly draw the information to the attention of my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling). As he has cropped up so conveniently in the discussion, I congratulate him on behalf of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
Committee and can explain his absence today, which is due to the birth yesterday or the day before yesterday of his first child, a son called Calum. I am told that he is recovering well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we are spending a moment on opening pleasantries, I remind the Minister that in the exchanges at the end of our previous sitting on 16 June, I asked about the Scottish Law Commission and its chairman, Lord Maxwell. The Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Lord Maxwell is the chairman of the Scottish Law Commission. He is due to retire on about 30 September 1988, and a successor will be announced in due course."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> First Scottish Standing Comittee, 16 June 1988; c. 30]</p></blockquote>
I congratulate the Minister on acting with such expedition. I do not know whether we can claim all the credit, but on the following day I read in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> that Lord Davidson had been appointed chairman of the Scottish Law Commission. I am sure that we all wish him well in his task.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are engaged in the fag end of the argument about the two amendments. They could be described as fillers and I do not intend to delay the Committee. I am not entirely convinced by what the Minister said about amendment No. 2. We were arguing about whether the word "solely" was a necessary part of clause 2(1)(a). The Minister seemed to be arguing that if the word were omitted, the paragraph might then mean that
	<br><blockquote><p>"hearsay evidence could not be excluded even if there were other grounds for exclusion such as relevancy or competency."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> First Scottish Standing Committee, 16 June 1988; c. 33.]</p></blockquote>
In simple terms, that boils down to the fact that evidence shall not be excluded on the grounds that it is hearsay. He seems to equate that with saying that it shall not be excluded on any other grounds. That seems a remarkable non-sequitur, and I do not understand it in terms of parsing the sentence. It is astonishing if we put it the other way round, because saying that evidence shall not be excluded on the ground that it is hearsay is clearly not the equivalent of saying that it cannot be excluded on any other ground. I believe that the word "solely" is redundant, but it is a matter of almost theological nicety, and I shall not pursue it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2(1)(c) seems to be redundant. Clearly the Scottish Law Commission believed that it was redundant, because it did not include similar words in the original draft Bill that it produced as an appendix to the report. Perhaps the cruellest thing that can be said about the provision is that it is unnecessary, an overkill. However, as it does no harm there is no point in proceeding with the debate, unless the Minister has anything to add. In fairness to the Minister, I intend, after he has said his piece, to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I reinforce what the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said about Lord Davidson. In days gone past I was his junior counsel and I am sure that he will be happy and have a fulfilled time as chairman of the Scottish Law Commission, which has contributed such invaluable support to the Scottish legal system in recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>39</span>
I could reply on these points at considerable length but I do not think that the hon. Gentleman wishes me to do so. However, the word "solely" is useful to clarify the point that hearsay evidence may still be excluded on such grounds as relevancy and competency. To leave out "solely" could give the impression that hearsay evidence could not be excluded on any grounds. I do not wish to put it any more strongly than that. "Solely" is a useful clarifying word.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 3, it is arguable that without clause 2(1)(c), the court would still be able to decide whether it was satisfied with the evidence. That is an essential part of the rules of evidence. Clause 2(1)(c) is considered to be a useful indicator and its deletion would means that clause 1 would contain such a reference while clause 2 did not. In that light, I hope that the hon. Gentleman withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will withdraw the amendment. However, I find the Minister's second point very surprising. I take the point that there is no harm in including clause 2(1)(c) in the Bill, but to say that it is needed to ensure that the court does not go mad and proceed on the basis that it does not need to be satisfield that a fact has been established seems to be pushing matters to an extreme. However, as the next amendment is much more substantial, and I do not wish to be accused of holding up the proceedings, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 4, in page 1, line 23, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(2A)(i) The court, on the application of any party to the action, may direct that any person who made a statement which has been adduced as evidence in the proof or any other person who made such a statement from which that statement is directly or indirectly derived, shall be lead as a witness at the proof and be examined as to the statements he made by the parties to the proceedings.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(ii) Before making any such direction the court must be satisfied that it is right to do so and it is reasonable and practicable in all the circumstances".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 6, in page 2, line 17, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2) Without prejudice to subsection (1) above, in any civil proceedings a statement in the precognition of a person who at the proof is examined as to the statement shall be admissable as evidence in so far as it tends to reflect unfavourably on that person's credibility.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a more substantial subject and I apologise if the argument takes a little longer than on previous amendments. I want to consider the points with care, and no doubt the Minister will reply to them with his usual courtesy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee who have been following our proceedings—I am not sure how many that is, given the eager attention with which the other Ministers are attending to their correspondence—will recognise that amendment No. 4 is a attempt to move some way back towards a recommendation that was made by the Scottish law Commission after a good deal of arguing and canvassing of the points. It was
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
part of the draft Bill which has been referred to a number of times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to get back to the principle of the safeguard recommended by the Scottish Law Commission, without groping in for the very complicated provision which was in the draft Bill. That was the counter—notice provision under which objection could be made after intermission that hearsay evidence was to be called. The courts then proceeded to apply a test of reasonableness and practicality. If they were satisfied, they directed that the evidence be led. That is an important matter which was argued at great length in the Scottish Law Commission report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am usually extremely critical of unexpected arrivals in Scottish debates because they are not always helpful or based upon a sympathetic interest in Scottish affairs. However, on Second Reading the hon. Member for Lancashire, West (Mr. Hind) intervened in the Minister's speech, he is not one of my favourites, for although I m sure that he is excellent in Lancashire, imported into Scotland he is obtrusive. However, on that occasion he made a good point picking up the main thrust of the amendment. He asked the Minister to consider the Civil Evidence Act 1968 for England and Wales. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is interesting to note that the Scottish Law Commission drew a parallel between the Bill and the 1968 Act, and recommended that the party against whom hearsay evidence is to be used should put the other party on notice. Has my hon. Friend now totally discounted that as a possibility? Such an action would be taking one by surprise and would be almost 'ambush evidence'. Has my hon. Friend decided not to putrsue that?"</p></blockquote>
I pay tribute to the hon. Gentleman because he has clearly followed the argument in detail. His reasonable point goes to the heart of our debate. The Minister did not disagree. He replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"My hon. Friend has raised an important point to which I shall come in a moment."</p></blockquote>
Ministers have an irritating, but no doubt, wise habit of coming to matters in a moment. They can then make sure that the script is written.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Lancashire, West argued that the Scottish Law Commission had a good point. If people did not have advance notice, or if there were no way to challenge hearsay evidence and ensure that the person responsible for the words was called, the party might be put at the wrong end of the evidence and at a considerable disadvantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made it clear that the Association of Reporters of Children's Panels was against the notice procedure as was the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, Lord Elliot of the Lands Court and the Faculty of Advocates. It is puzzling that COSLA is involved in such an argument although it has expert legal staff. Just because those groups were against the notice procedure does not mean that they would not be worried about the principle of hearsay evidence being introduced without the right of cross-examination and scrutiny. That is the kernel of the argument of the Scottish Law Commission. When the Minister listed those against the notice procedure, he failed to deal with the central fact that the Scottish Law Commission was in favour of building in safeguards. The Minister was in fine and confident
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0030">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>41</span>
mood that day. He said of the Scottish Law Commission report:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have absorbed every word of the report, which makes it clear that these difficulties might arise."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, we shall have a fluent response to the report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of people oppose the notice procedure but that does not mean that they would not be impressed by the argument that lies behind amendment No. 4. They are not here to say whether they would be impressed or not and I cannot even quote hearsay from them one way or tother.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was not impressed by the Minister's argument in dismissing the Law Commission's amendment. On Second Reading he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A number of those who responded to the consultation on behalf of my noble and learned Friend the Lord Advocate were of the view that while reform was necessary, the commissions proposal to allow the courts to retain a power to refuse to admit hearsay evidence, together with an associated notice procedure, could have the effect simply of reintroducing the rule against hearsay. The Government were persuaded by this argument and the Bill simply abolishes the rule against hearsay".—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 16 May 1988; Vol. 133, c. 737–9.]</p></blockquote>
I am being fair when I say that that was the Minister's entire argument. He merely told us that a number of those who responded—I do not whether it was a majority, two or three or large number with a great weight of learned expertise behind them—I felt that it would be reintroducing hearsay by the back door. The Government were persuaded of that and that was the end of the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Minister's defence, he was positively expansive in his arguments compared with what the Lord Advocate said in another place, but the Law Commission's case was fully-argued and we are entitled to hear more from the Minister today. That is why we have tabled this amendment, which is not just a probing amendment. There is more to it than that. I maintain an open mind and I want to hear what the Minister has to say before deciding. The amendment would allow the court on application of any party to direct that a witness responsible for a hearsay statement or whose hearsay statement had been quoted in evidence must be led. That person must be led if so directed, but the court must consider safeguards and decide whether it is reasonable, practical and right so to do. That is the essence of the matter very simply. The arguments produced by the Scottish Law Commission were extensive and much thought was given by Lord Maxwell and his experienced colleagues, Dr. Clive and Sheriff Gordon Nicholson, who are known to the Minister and others, when they made this recommendation. Hon. Members will remember the broad outline of the argument. Paragraph 3.15 argues for the retention of the general rule excluding hearsay evidence, which was overturned by the Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What gave the Scottish Law Commission the greatest anxiety—it comes through loud and clear in its report—is that hearsay evidence is
	<br><blockquote><p>"a statement made by a person when not under oath and"—</p></blockquote>
this is the key point—
	<br><blockquote><p>"not subject to cross-examination or the scrutiny of the court".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
Paragraph 3.21 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"No doubt cross-examination may sometimes be unduly prolonged"—</p></blockquote>
like speeches, it can sometimes be a pain—
	<br><blockquote><p>"but in our view under our system of adversary procedure it can often be an essential tool for extracting the truth."</p></blockquote>
I do not pretend that my anecdotal experience is of great relevance, because it is many years since I stood in court and acted in a trial—getting on for a decade perhaps. To allow hearsay evidence without the right of cross-examination of the person whose words are being relied on must be taken seriously. It is right that all the facts should be before the court and if they are hearsay facts, the court must give them proper weight—they should not be excluded. I have sufficient respect for the rights of the other parties to the action in civil procedure—the principles are the same for criminal procedure—to believe that, if possible it is desirable to give them the right to cross examine. I am not convinced by the Minister's argument that it is a dangerous precedent to allow the court to insist upon that and so admit hearsay evidence by the back door. Even if the court cannot allow cross-examination, it has the power to exclude that evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 3.21 of the Scottish Law Commission's report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Sometimes, though perhaps not very frequently, it enables one party to demonstrate that his opponent's witness it dishonest. More often, it enables the real import and weight of evidence, which it not actually dishonest, to be ascertained by an exploration of the sources, basis and context of the evidence in chief. Even more important, in our view, it enables the witness to be asked questions about matters which may be relevant to the case but on which he has not been examined in chief. If hearsay were always to be permitted without further safeguard, it would enable any person through the medium of hearsay to give evidence on some matters while remaining shielded from questions on other matters … For these reasons we could not recommend a simple abolition of the rule against hearsay without making some further provision."</p></blockquote>
That is a firm statement from the Scottish Law Commission, which has been swept aside in only two or three lines. I repeat its conclusions:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For these reasons we could not recommend a simple abolition of the rule against hearsay"</p></blockquote>
However a simple abolition of the rule against hearsay will take place. The Minister must give more information about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wherever posible, if the statement is relevant and central to the issue of a proof, it should be tested by cross-examination. That can be achieved only by directing that, wherever practicable, the person involved is produced as a witness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a different context, the Scottish Law Commission has also produced discussion paper no. 75 on "The Evidence of Children and Other Potentially Vulnerable Witnesses". That paper is hot off the press, as it was published only a few weeks' ago. The Minister will be fairly familiar with it, although I do not expect that, on this occasion, he has absorbed every word as it contains many words. The paper is largely the work of sheriff Nicholson and when assessing and weighing the evidence of children, he considers the problems of hearsay in a criminal context. The authors of the document were understandably anxious about criminal trials,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0031">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>43</span>
particularly involving allegations against children, but some of the principles that they found remain the same for civil actions. It is worth giving that document a quick glance to reinforce my primary theme that the Scottish Law Commission is right to give weight to the important of cross-examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 4.13 of "The Evidence of Children and Other Potentially Vulnerable Witnesses" says that the sixth amendment to the constitution of the United State of America deals specifically with the right to confront witnesses. That right is written into the constitution. In the case of Coy 	<i>v.</i> State of Iowa, current litigation is considering whether the use of one-way screens breaches the constitution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nearer to home is article 6(3)(d) of the European Convention on Human Rights, which, I hasten to add, deals specifically with criminal offences. It says that everyone charged with a criminal offence has certain minimum rights. The one of particular interest to us is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"to examine or have examined witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against him".</p></blockquote>
That is a safeguard in criminal procedure and it demonstrates the importance of cross-examination. There are substantial and important issues in civil proofs. In a case of personal damages when someone has been badly crippled, and when the outcome of the proof will lead to substantial damages that will give the victim financial security throughout his life, the rules of evidence on which the decision will be made are of great importance. Another important area involves children's panel proofs before the sheriff. Section 44 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 deals with the twilight area between criminal and civil law, where there is always controversy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will accept that there is a strong reason for serious examination of the right to cross-examine safeguard. Paragraph 3.38 of the Scottish Law Commission report, which is the basis of the Bill says—I shall put it in short compass.
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have concluded that the only safe way to deal with this is to confer upon the court a power to exclude hearsay evidence in certain prescribed circumstances unless the original maker of the statement has been called as a witness and has been examined in relation to the statement."</p></blockquote>
That was the Scottish Law Commission's final decision. "The only safe way" was a strong statement for such a body to make. The only safe way in which to deal with the self-evident dangers to which it points in its detailed arguments is to give the court a power to exclude hearsay evidence in certain prescribed circumstances. We have a duty to consider that finding carefully. We then have the problem, however, of deciding what the safeguard should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I explained to the Committee, the Scottish Law Commission decided on a complicated procedure by which a notice and then a counter notice are served. A debate then takes place before the judge or sheriff to decide whether the court should direct that a person be led in evidence. I presume that the commission's final decision was that, if proper arrangements could not be made, the evidence could be excluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
I have tabled a simple amendment, which does not seem to lead to some of the problems that may have weighted with the Minister and others when they considered those matters. The amendment says that the court shall
	<br><blockquote><p>"direct that any person who made a statement which has been adduced as evidence in the proof or any other person who made such a statement from which that statement is directly or indirectly derived, shall be led as a witness at the proof and be examined as to the statements he made by the parties to the proceedings.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(ii) Before making any such direction the court must be satisfied that it is right to do so and it is reasonable and practicable in all the circumstances."</p></blockquote>
That seems to be an uncomplicated, sensible provision. I do not want to plunge into the notice procedure. It is not included in the amendment as the nuts and bolts are much more simple. The principle is the kernel of the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have kept the same tests as the Scottish Law Commission recommends and the qualifications, which are sensible. It is required that any direction is to be based on a test of whether it is practical. That covers a situation where, to take the point to extremes, someone is dead and cannot give evidence. In those circumstances, the hearsay evidence might be admissible, but that is going to extremes. The direction for such evidence should also be reasonable in terms of trouble and expense. Paragraph 3.42 of the Scottish Law Commission's report raises the point that it should not be exercisable ex proprio motu by the court, but must be on the application of one of the parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have gone some way towards explaining some of my doubts and why I am anxious to tempt the Minister into giving a fuller explanation than he has given so far. The central case of the Scottish Law Commission is persuasive and it is not enough for the Government to say that they were not persuaded by a number of those who responded to the discussion document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A relevant matter, which no doubt the Minister will wish to discuss, is clause 4, which is headed "Leading of additional evidence". I mention it here only because of its impact upon the amendment and clause before us. We may debate it later. Will the Minister explain how it fits into the general pattern?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notes on clauses—always a helpful document—say about clause 4:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Although a party to an action is to be entiled by clause 2 to rely on hearsay evidence it may in some circumstances be necessary for him to seek to lead evidence from a witness. That witness may already have been in court either because he has given evidence already on another aspect or because he did not expect to be called as a witness."</p></blockquote>
It is to get over that difficulty that we have clause 4. It disapplies section 3 of the Evidence (Scotland) Act 1840 and no doubt that makes some sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, the Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Clause 4 ensures that the fact that a person has been present in court during the proceedings does not prevent him from being called as a witness or recalled to give evidence to clarify hearsay evidence admitted under clause 2."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 16 May 1988; Vol. 133, c. 741.]</p></blockquote>
The Minister will be able to help me on this matter, because he has had much more experience of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0032">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>45</span>
litigation than I have. I presume that if someone knows that he has to rely on hearsay, or that hearsay evidence will come up, there is nothing to stop him putting into the box the person whose words are being used if he or she is available, at his discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If hearsay unexpectedly appears in evidence, the other party can then busy itself tracing the person responsible for uttering that hearsay and then call him in his turn. I presume that there are existing powers, even as the Bill is debated, for the court to allow that, even if the witness had not appeared on a witness list and normal notice had not been given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be extraordinary if there was what the hon. Member for Lancashire, West described on Second Reading as an ambush and an ambush was sprung, in that something of real importance emerged in the form of hearsay and the other party immediately began digging out the person, who did not appear on a witness list, and getting him cited to appear at the action. Have people an unfettered right to do so, or would they run into difficulties in terms of notice and witness lists? That is important. If people have an unfettered right to do that, it removes a little of the strain and some of the arguments that have been deployed. I ask the Minister to respond specifically to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that in such circumstances the alternative is to say to the court that a piece of hearsay evidence is germane and explain what the person meant when he uttered the words. The Minister will have had, as I have, experience of the tremendous intellectual games that can be played by both sides in a civil action or a criminal trial about the proper interpretation of a particular word.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember a famous criminal trial in Greenock in which a client of a firm with which I am still associated was alleged to have replied to a caution on a charge of armed robbery, "I demand an identification parade. I was wearing a mask when I done it". He was acquitted by the jury, which after long argument about the proper interpretation of those words, decided that they had been uttered in jest. The jury was presumably helped to that apparently surprising conclusion by the fact that the accused went into the box and explained what he meant by those words and the way in which he said them. If he had not given evidence, he would have been dead in terms of that trial and it would also have made the jury's task much more difficult. I give that example because even in a civil trial, there will clearly be occasions on which interpretations of words will be important. If they are hearsay, the court, the jury—if it is a civil jury trial—the judge or the sheriff will be in acute difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I ask the Minister again whether it is clear that if such an ambush arises, anyone can seek cite and have the opportunity of producing the person. What would be the procedure if there were difficulties of citation and time of citation? What is wrong with the principle enshrined in the amendment, which provides that to avoid doubt someone can go to the sheriff and say, "We know that this guy is living in X town. We know that the hearsay evidence will be important to you or the jury. Please give a direction that he be brought here,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
cited by the court and produced so that he can be cross-examined."? That seems a sensible provision and I urge the Minister to accept it. I hope that I have said enough to convince the Minister that he has more to deal with than he realised on Second Reading. It is an obscure matter, but the arguments and principle are important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 3.51 of the Scottish Law Commission's report refers to the present law and practice in court. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the court may sometimes refuse to allow a person to be called as a witness if he has previously been present in court".</p></blockquote>
The report then deals with the arguments relating to clause 4, to which I referred. It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"While we consider that this power to call or recall is probably a necessary ingredient for the working of the scheme, we think that in many cases it would have to be resorted to."</p></blockquote>
I find that extremely puzzling. I presume that the word "not" is missing from that sentence. Perhaps the Minister will explain, as it does not make sense as it stands. I say that merely as an aside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In refuting the need for this type of amendment, the Minister is relying on the fact that it amounts to a reintroduction of hearsay. That may be so if one assumes that the evidence can be excluded. However, a simpler proposition is that the court should have powers to ensure that, whenever practical, someone gives evidence. That would not involve such difficulties. On the basis of what the Minister has said, it appears that he has a poor opinion of the courts' judgments. That is surprising as the Minister has always struck me as someone who would take a straightforward—I was going to say simplistic, but that sounds insulting and I do not mean to be—view of the wisdom of our judicial system. If he is saying that the introduction of the power offered by the Scottish Law Commission would reintroduce hearsay by the back door, that would mean that the courts were taking a broad and destructive view of their remit to apply a reasonable and practical test. The intention of the statute would be that unless there were special reasons—such as the availability of evidence, reasonably and practically—which were not being advanced, hearsay should normally be admitted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we agree that the best evidence rule is important, it is right for the witness whose hearsay is being relied on to be in court. That is not a partisan matter—the witness should be there to help to court. Because we have a clear Scottish Law Commission recommendation, argued at length, with no counter arguments, we should challenge the Minister to produce more information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 6 deals with precognition. We need not spend much time on that, but it is quite important and I want to hear the Minister's views. The amendment is another reinstatement job, if I may put it like that. Clause 5 of the Scottish Law Commission's draft Bill, which is effectively our amendment No. 6, says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In any civil proceedings a statement in the precognition of a person who at the proof is examined as to the statement shall be admissable as evidence insofar as it tends to reflect unfavourably on that person's credibility."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0033">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
I am not attacking the main provision of clause 3 which seeks to broaden the issue and make it clear that
	<br><blockquote><p>"a statement made otherwise than in the course of the proof by a person who at the proof is examined as to the statement shall be admissable as evidence insofar as it tends to reflect favourably or unfavourably on that person's credibility."</p></blockquote>
Up to now, evidence could be admissable only if it reflected unfavourably and the clause seeks to broaden that to become a buttress to, as well as an attack on, credibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the general proposition that a precognition must be treated on a different basis from that of other statements. That is achieved in the interpretation in clause 9, in which the word "statement" is defined. I accept that difference, but I am worried that we may be taking it too far. It is valid that precognition has special status because it is not a statement by the person. I have spent enough weary hours during my career taking precognitions to know what an imaginative gloss they can sometimes be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A precognition is a statement taken in preparation for the case—a criminal case, or a civil case in this instance. It is a reinterpretation of what the witness says by the precognition clerk or the solicitor who takes the precognition. While that is a useful aide-memoire and a warning about that the witness is likely to say, it is by definition not necessarily in the witness's exact words. It could merely be a résumé of his position, into which inaccuracy may creep. Therefore, it must be treated specially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we reject clause 5 of the draft Bill of the Scottish Law Commission and reject amendment No. 6, we shall stop anyone putting to a witness a precognition regarding that particular proof on which they have gone back at the trial or at the proof itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that a key witness described how the accident in a personal injury case happened and there is a clash of evidence between a representative of the employer and the pursuer. The counsel hears a totally different account from the one he expected from the precognition that he took.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Should not one be able to ask a witness whether he was precognosed on a certain day, whether what he said contradicts his present evidence, and what is the explanation? The Government should comment on that because it may be extremely important for credibility. Presumably, counsel cannot do that on the grounds that precognition is not a statement and, therefore, cannot be used in the way described in cluse 3. I wish to write it in, in the narrow terms that I have described, as something which can be put to a witness if an agent or counsel is satisfied that the witness has gone back on an earlier statement. I am happy that that possibility should be excluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am critical of the Minister because he took 47 minutes to introduce the Bill, which is even longer than I shall take now, but he took only a fraction of that time dealing with this point:
	<br><blockquote><p>"However, there is an exception to that broad rule. By virtue of the definition of 'statement' in clause 9 a precognition cannot be used to support or attack credibility. A precognition is simply an
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
account prepared by another person, such as a solicitor, of the evidence likely to be available from a witness. Thus, a statement in a precognition is different in nature from a statement made by the witness himself."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 16 May 1988; Vol. 133, col. 741.]</p></blockquote>
Full stop, end of story. That is an unexceptionable statement. Perhaps the Minister could elaborate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already dealt with liability, so I can keep within the time limit. I shall leave it there, and invite the Minister to comment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) for speaking to these important amendments. A number of us have dismantled the credibility of Minisers for some time, but it does not seem to do much good, because they carry on regardless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend is right to examine the sources of hearsay evidence. He read out the specific arguments for the retention of the rule to which the Scottish Law Commission referred, including the fact that hearsay evidence may be concocted. Therefore, anyone who may fall foul of such hearsay evidence should have the right to undermine the credibility of it. What better way is there to do that than to subject the source of that evidence to cross-examination?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By a strange co-incidence, each member of the Committee has a special reason for being interested in the threat of civil action this morning, because we have all received impressive-looking legal documents from the High Court of Justice, Queen's bench division in Sheffield district registry. I know not whether they are forgeries, but someone has spent a fortune on postage alone. They are signed by no less a person than Christ, otherwise known as A. J. Hill. He has laid this action and his claim is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"1. My rightful sovereignty over the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to be recognised by the Defendant."</p></blockquote>
It is addressed to all Members of the House of Lords and the House of Commons, royal Dukes and all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"2. My rightful ownership of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and everything thereupon and appertaining thereto to be recognised by the Defendant."—</p></blockquote>
and just to tidy things up—
	<br><blockquote><p>"3. £100,000,000 Damages."</p></blockquote>
Obviously, we shall have to defend ourselves against this important claim. I do not know whether documentary evidence will be advanced in support of this claim: there may be tablets of stone, or concrete or whatever one gets in Sheffield these days, based on scripture. Perhaps Mr. A. J. Hill may simply base his case on the hearsay evidence that the Almighty has stated that he has a right to the things set out in the summons. In that case there should be a way of cross-examing the source of such hearsay evidence.

We are assembled here with a wealth of legal expertise at the disposal of the Minister and my hon.

We could do with some advice on how to defend ourselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not strictly necessary for the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) to seek legal advice on that point, but serious matters have been raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) criticised me mildly for speaking for 45 minutes on Second Reading. He spoke for about 45 minutes on the clause stand part debate during our previous sitting and for about 45 minutes this morning. The difference between our speeches is that mine covered a much wider and larger area of ground. We shall consider evidence for children under amendment No. 11 because it is an important point that merits detailed consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to those who made representations against the notice procedure during our previous sitting, the hon. Member for Garscadden implied that our support for all Scottish Law Commission reports is a knee-jerk reaction. It is not a knee-jerk reaction because we are bound to take into account the representations sent to us. Lord Elliott was not responding as an individual, but as president of the court concerned. The other body, which the hon. Gentleman did not mention, was the Association of Sheriffs Principal, which is not in favour of a notice procedure. The majority of those who submitted representations were against the notice procedure. As the hon. Member for Garscadden said, those views were from well-respected sources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill makes hearsay evidence admissible, but places the onus on a party to decide whether the person concerned can rely on that evidence or should make every effort to bring along the maker of the statement. I would always recommend that the person should go for the best evidence available and hearsay evidence can still be characterised as such. If a party could bring the maker of a hearsay statement to court as a witness and does not do so, the court would automatically give regard to that fact. The hon. Member for Garscadden made that point in relation to the due weight given to evidence available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a witness is available and is not called, the hearsay evidence is not the best evidence and the court would attach considerably less weight to it. If the party challenges the hearsay evidence and seeks leave of the court, the court can adjourn and summon the witness by citation. I shall come to that when we discuss clause 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, many tribunals operate by allowing hearsay evidence without a cumbersome notice procedure. To my knowledge, that has not been the subject of substantial criticism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Garscadden asked about adequate notice for the calling of witnesses. The court has competence to call witnesses, and may adjourn a case as necessary to allow witnesses to be brought. Those powers are contained in clause 4, which I shall deal with in more detail later. The question about who is competent and who is compellable was set in my degree exams, and the same rules apply: not everyone who is competent is compellable. For example, a wife is not necessarily compellable against her husband.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>50</span>
The hon. Gentleman asked about a missing "not" and I shall look at the draft Scottish Law Commission Bill to see whether further clarification is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 4 would enable the court to direct that the maker of a statement should be led as a witness. I cannot accept the amendment, as it is, in essence, a resuscitation of the Scottish Law Commission's proposal to have a notice procedure for hearsay evidence. On Second Reading, I said that the Government had not implemented that proposal as it would re-introduce the rule against hearsay. The amendment would have the same effect, and would be entirely contrary to the manner in which the Bill seeks to deal with hearsay evidence: by admitting the evidence and allowing the court to accord the appropriate weight to that evidence. That is the best way to deal with that type of evidence because it achieves simplicity and availability of evidence in accordance with the guiding principles adopted by the Scottish Law Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In no sense do we have a poor judgment of the courts, as the hon. Member for Garscadden suggested. I take a straightforward view and believe that our approach makes for simplicity and avoids the danger of making court proceedings too cumbersome. Naturally, I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point about safeguards. His amendment is unnecessary because there is alreay a safeguard. If either party wishes to have the maker of a statement brought before the court to clarify hearsay evidence, clause 4 provides for that by enabling the calling of an additional witness or the recalling of a previous witness. A witness could be compelled to attend by being cited to appear. That is the best way to deal with such a situation. The parties remain in control of their case and can chooe whether to lead evidence direct from the maker of a statement or leave it to the court to decide what weight should be given to hearsay evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A fundamental difference between what somebody says in court and a precognition is that a precognition is not given under oath—in most cases it is a statement made in confidence by a client to his solicitor. The amendment introduces a provision similar to clause 5 of the draft Bill, whereby a statement in a precognition can be used to attach the credibility of a witness. The Lord Advocate consulted on the proposed use of precognitions in that way and the proposal was rejected by the Law Society of Scotland, the Faculty of Advocates and the Lord President of the Court of Session, who went so far as to say that the proposal was "utterly misconceived".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My objections to the amendment are based on the nature of a precognition, outlined in paragraph 3.57 of the Scottish Law Commission report. Although those comments were about another proposal on precognitions, they are equally relevant to attacks on credibility. The essential characteristic of a precognition is that it is the product of the maker of a statement and the precognoscer. It may contain certain glosses supplied by the precognoscer and may be slanted towards the interests of the party on whose behalf the questions are being asked. Therefore, I do not believe that such documents are reliable sources of an attack on credibility.

11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not stopping a statement being used to attack credibility, but we are not allowing a version of the statement, the precognition, to be used in that way. In view of what I have said and the considerable weight of views and representations against such use of precognitions, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is interesting. To put the record straight, the issue of the missing "not" was meant as an aside and I did not intend the Minister to follow it up with great energy. It was not in the draft Bill, but in paragraph 3.51 of the Law Commission's report, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"While we consider that this power to call or recall is probably a necessary ingredient for the working of the scheme, we think that in many cases it would have to be resorted to. A court could always, if it thought fit, hear evidence"</p></blockquote>
and so on. I thought that the word "not" should be included and that it should read
	<br><blockquote><p>"in many cases it would not have to be resorted to".</p></blockquote>
However, I may have misunderstood the paragraph—it is not unknown for me to misunderstand paragraphs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made an interesting point about precognitions. I did not develop the point at great length, but it is an interesting and important one. He said that the concept is unsound. I did not weary the Committee in my first contribution with the arguments put forward by the Scottish Law Commission, which made the recommendations that the Minister attacked. I certainly exonerate him from the charge of knee-jerk reaction—he attacked them with vim and vigour. Paragraph 3.57 of the report, referring to earlier doubts that the Scottish Law Commission had expressed, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"However, we do think that there is a case for allowing the use of precognitions for the limited purpose of challenging a witness's credibility. If, for example, a person is precognosced on behalf of one party to a litigation and when called as a witness for another party, gives evidence in flat contradiction of what he said on precognition, we think that this is a matter which should properly be available to the court."</p></blockquote>
That is the argument that I adduced, it is a self-evident argument, culled from the bottom of paragraph 3.57.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the Minister said that that was nonsense, because a precognition was unsound. It could not be used as a statement in the normal sense, because it was a gloss that had been sieved by someone else. It was someone's account of what someone had said. I should like the Minister to comment on the fact that the Bill allows multiple as well as simple hearsay. The definition of multiple hearsay is that it has passed through that very process—it is what someone said someone had told him that someone had said. That apparently does not strike at the usefulness of multiple hearsay. The Scottish Law Commission said that both simple and multiple hearsay should be admissible, although the fact that multiple hearsay is not direct hearsay could be borne in mind. If multiple hearsay is to be allowed, why is a precognition anathema in the absolute sense suggested by the Minister? It may be that the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>52</span>
precognition clerk has been inaccurate and that it is not a fair representation. That would be true of any second-hand hearsay and that fact should be assimilated by the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if I accept the Minister's argument—and I am not sure that I do—it is fair to ask him to apply it in criminal cases. He may think that it is wrong to allow a precognition to be used and put to a witness, but it is an every-day occurrence for the Crown or the defence witness. I have often asked Mr. So-and-so, "Do you remember that someone took a statement from you on such-and-such a day?" The answer can be yes or no. If the witness says no, he can be pressed very hard, and the precognition clerk can be called which will put the witness's credibiity at risk. If the witness says yes, it clearly implies that he is now lying. He can then be asked on which occasion he was telling the truth, and why he has changed his story. Is the Minister saying that that should not be allowed in a criminal trial? His arguments against amendment No. 6 under a civil setting must also apply to criminal evidence. Will the Minister explain exactly why a precognition can be used in one case but not in another?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I were in the circumstances described in paragraph 3.57 and were acting for my client, I would find it professionally frustrating when I cross-examined a key witness for the other side, whom I had taken care to precognosce in advance had had obtained a version that was extremely helpful to my client, if he said something totally different—not just a nice little change of emphasis but a change of absolute essentials—and he went back on what he said to my precognition clerk or myself. Is it right that I should not be able to put that to him on the grounds that precognitions are excluded from the definition of statement in clause 9? The argument is doubtful, and the Minister should attack it with more open vigour than he has done hitherto.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some sympathy with what the Minister has said, but I wish to tidy up some of the edges. I have not tried to reintroduce the Scottish Law Commission's version. The essence of its version is that when a notice, a counter-notice or a challenge has been served "the court may hold that any such statement is not admissible unless and until the person concerned has been led and examined. That seems to be a vote of no confidence in the court, and readmits hearsay evidence by the back door. One must assume that some crusty old judge will say that the abolition of hearsay except under certain circumstances in the 1988 Act, means nothing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am prepared to listen to the Minister when he tells me that I do not need to worry because my amendment simply allows the court to direct that the witness be produced. The only reason for not producing the witness would be reasonableness and practicality. If I leave it on that simple note, the Minister considers it redundant because it is covered in clause 4. I am prepared to listen to the Minster's argument as long as I am sure that I have got it right. I might have gone for the Scottish Law Commission scenario which would have allowed the evidence to be struck out, but I have not done that. I merely wished to establish beyond peradventure that the evidence could be admitted if one side so wished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>53</span>
I have not done any complex civil litigation for a long time. One could count the number of proofs that I have done on the fingers of one hand. I have forgotten all the rules which have probably all changed, however, let us suppose that I am snoozing my way through what seems a strong case, confident that we are going to win when suddenly towards the end of the other side's evidence, or after I have completed my evidence and while the other side's witnesses are in the box, they suddenly produce a hearsay statement from a third party which, if it is believed, will totally strike at my case. If it is a civil jury trial, the court can presumably give a direction to the jury that it is hearsay and that they might want to consider why the person concerned was not produced when, apparently there was no reason for him not to appear. I know that a statement can be given, but it is much more satisfactory if such a person can be produced. At that stage, I have lodged my witness lists, I have concluded my case, and we are coming towards the end of hearing the evidence from the other side's witnesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister satisfied that there is no impediment in clause 4 and that, at the end of hearing the other side's evidence, I can say that I want to call an additional witness? It is nothing to do with whether that person has been in court. I realise that there could be a difficulty because of the Evidence (Scotland) Act 1840, but I want to know whether I can add that witness to my list. I have finished my evidence and have never submitted the guy concerned as a witness, but I have been ambushed by a piece of hearsay, and I want him brought to court. Do I have an unfettered right to do so? If I am satisfied on that key point, I shall rest content. There are, especially in the Court of session, strict rules about lodging lists of witnesses and production of witnesses. I suspect that in normal circumstances, having concluded my case I would be well and truly snookered—to use a technical legal term—and that I would be unable to call an additional witness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the distinction regarding the Scottish Law Commission's notice procedure, which gives the court the right to refuse to admit the evidence until someone has been called. The court, on a motion, should be able to insist that the witness be called, unless it is satisfied that it is not practical or reasonable to do so. That is not an unreasonable proposition, and may even have a little more authority than the pursuer or defender's agent saying, "We have to do this in a hell of a hurry. Go and find so-and-so and we will try for a motion to have him called as an additional witness at the end of the other party's case." There are difficulties involved in that, but there may be positive virtues in something such as the amendment, which would allow me to say that the onus should not be upon us, but on the other side, to explain why the witness cannot be produced. There is a slight but important difference and I should be interested to hear the Minister's comments on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can reassure the hon. Gentleman. I have not attacked the Scottish Law Commission, as he suggested, but have listened
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>54</span>
carefully to the representations which were made on consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman wants to know whether an additional witness can be called under clause 4. The clause provides that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any person may at the proof, with leave of the court, at any time before the commencement of the stage of closing submission"</p></blockquote>
be called as an additional witness. So that safeguard certainly exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to explain exactly what is a precognition. It is a statement, usually prepared by someone other than the witness, setting out the summary of that witness's evidence. It is usually prepared in contemplation of, or after the beginning of, legal proceedings. The fear is that if precognitions were admissible, they would be unreliable. They are not given under oath and a gloss could be placed on the words used by the person taking them down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have never suggested that the Scottish Law Commission's argument on the use of precognitions was nonsense. I have suggested, however, that a statement will be available. If it were absolutely necessary to establish what a witness said, the precognoscer could be called. That meets the hon. Gentleman's point about multiple hearsay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question then is whether the precognoscer would be compellable. He is not compellable only if there is a solicitor-client relationship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With those assurances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate becomes interesting, but I take most of the Minister's points. I am prepared to rest satisfied on the main point about clause 4. I understand what the Minister said; he has good advice and I am sure that I can take it at face value. I was a little doubtful because the notes on clauses are ambiguous. The arguments are based on section 3 of the Evidence (Scotland) Act 1840 and the need to get over the difficulty of someone who has been in court not being able to give evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the Minister's point that anyone can be recalled at any time on the leave of the court. Presumably, someone before a judge might say that he has suddenly been presented with a hearsay statement by Mr. X who is not on the witness list. He might believe that he could find him and want an adjournment of three days. He might have to cite Mr. X and there are time limits on proper citation. Or would the court give an order? I am not sure, so perhaps the Minister can deal with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. X might be prayed in evidence but his body might not be there to be cross-examined. The sheriff might be told, "This is a matter of importance and we want to cross-examine Mr. X about this. We intend to ask your Lordship's permission to have him added at the end of the case, which we expect to finish later this afternoon. Clearly, we need time to look for him and if he is not willing to come we must cite him on a proper induciae." Presumably, in those circumstances the court would have power to grant that adjournment. It may be egging the pudding to ask the Minister about that, but we should be clear about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0037">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>55</span>
If the Minister reassures me on that I shall rest content. The Scottish Law Commission had a reasonable point. We may be leaving an important argument behind us, but I accept that in closing submissions great play could be made of the fact that someone was not there to speak and that hearsay should be treated with a fair amount of scepticism. I am impressed by the argument of practicality regarding the cumbersome procedure of contest over evidence and by the possibility of it being struck out, which lies at the heart of the Scottish Law Commission formula. Therefore, subject to what the Minister says finally, I shall allow the matter to pass.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other matter, I understand what the Minister said but he did not deal with my main argument. Why should it be unacceptable in civil procedure to put a precognition to the person offering a different version in the witness box when that is commonly done in criminal proceedings presumably with the Minister's blessing, or at least without his attempt to change the law? He may say that the Scottish Law Commission is investigating the law of criminal evidence in Scotland and all may change. It is unlikely because the Scottish Law Commission has taken an opposite view to the Minister on that matter. If it left the criminal rules as they are, it would be interesting to see whether the Minister disagreed again and moved to amend the law to strike out the putting of a precognition, as he has done on this occasion by leaving out clause 5 of the Law Commission's draft Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no question of compellability because the situation would arise only if the precognition had been taken by one's own side and on behalf of one's client. One will know whether the bloke has gone back on his precognition only because one has it in one's hand. He is a witness for the other side, he is properly precognosced, one has one's own precognition and it would be possible to lead the precognition taker to say, "I saw him on such-and-such a day and he told me a totally different story". I am confused about that. Obviously, one cannot do that until one knows that the witness has gone back on his story.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that the witness is for the defender. After one has completed one's case and called all the witnesses, this wretched witness goes into the box and, as his evidence unfolds, one realises that he is telling a totally different story from the one that he told two weeks previously on precognition. One cannot put that to the witness, because one is excluded from doing so by the definition of "statement" in the Bill, and because one has closed one's case. If one tries to lead in evidence and say that that witness is lying, one must put that to him, but one cannot do so because of the clause and because one has closed one's case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister, who is doubtless more up to date that me on such matters, explain how it can be worked? If the way out of the difficulty is to lead the precognition clerk, how can one do that if one has closed one's case? Is it proper to do that when one has not put it to the witness involved? I am doubtful about that. Will the Minister explain the difference
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>56</span>
in criminal proceedings, which I presume that he is attacking?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While the Miniser is pondering on the important and fascinating point about precognition clerks, I shall raise a further issue which is relevant to the hearsay evidence that Members of Parliament commit to paper almost every week. For example, how often have you, Mr. Martin, written to the chief constable saying, "Dear Chief Constable, my constituent, Mr. X, alleges that he saw his neighbour, Mr. Y, setting fire to his car in such-and-such a place on such-and-such a day and he cannot understand why the police are not investigating that allegation." We alldo that—it is part of our job—and we do so onthe strength of an allegation made to us, as Members of Parliament, by individual constituents and without hearing the other side of the story.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be worried if such documentary evidence that an allegation had been made could be accepted in court as hearsay evidence. If anything that I committed to paper were to appear in such circumstances, I should want to set the record straight and to explain to the court that I had written the account of the allegation on the basis of what I had heard from one constituent without hearing the other side of the story. I am worried that hearsay evidence, in documentary form or otherwise, could get into circulation in a court and give rise to unsafe findings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The detailed point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) is technically more interesting but as a humble, lay Member of Parliament who, by the nature of my job, is a purveyor of hearsay allegations, I think that we should have some assurances and safeguards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In response to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dear), there is no question that, in principle, additional witnesses can be called right up to the commencement of closing submissions. Regarding the citation of witnesses, if a party is taken by surprise by hearsay evidence, he could say that he wanted to call the witness involved. It is more likely that the witness is available, but not called. In those circumstances, the other party could make it clear to the court that the best available evidence had not been relied upon in that the witness involved had not been called.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Garscadden asked what procedural steps would be taken. I shall make inquiries about what the relevant motion and form should be and I shall send him a letter about that. The hon. Gentleman also asked about the difference between criminal and civil evidence. As he knows, that is the subject of an inquiry by the Scottish Law Commission. Although the Bill does not extend to criminal proceedings, I appreciate the feelings of the hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members about corroboration. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to submit his views to the commission, I shall ensure that his views are communicated to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present the Government have no plans to change the law on corroboration. The Law

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>57</span>
Commission is reviewing the whole area of criminal evidence and is carrying out extensive consultation. The hon. Member for Garscadden will not wish me to speculate about the commission's likely recommenations, nor would he wish me to prejudice the issues with which it is dealing. Such action would render pointless the detailed consideration being undertaken by the commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a general level, there is a difference in scale between types of cases in criminal law. A murder case in which someone's life has been taken differs from a case in which someone has been severely injured. But obviously, all the evidence is a matter for the commission, and we look forward to receiving its proposals in due course. There will certainly be no knee-jerk response, which the hon. Member for Garscadden feared. We are prepared to consider outside views on the ultimate recommendations before taking any action. As the Bill shows, we are prepared to depart from the commission's detailed recommendations when we consider that to be appropriate. I shall study the points of procedure and write to the hon. Gentleman about the correct and most appropriate steps.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intervene for the last time on this matter, you will be relieved to hear, Mr. Martin—I fear that we are battering against a cotton wool wall and will get no further. I seldom accuse the Minister of a touch of malice. But his suggestion that I should submit evidence to the inquiry strays across the boundaries of malice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To my hon. Friend or to the commission?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Possibly to both. I should be grateful if the Minister took the trouble to write to me—it is partly curiosity on my part, but it is important—to explain what would happen if a precognition could not be put in a civil proof of a party, but where it was determined to lead the precognition clerk in an attempt to destroy the credibility of the witness, having failed to shake him on cross-examination without that weapon. What motion would be moved to do that, and would the witness concerned be subsequently recalled? It would be wrong to say that the precognition clerk was lying without allowing the witness to rebut that claim and explain. Clearly, there would have to be machinery for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister understands the point. If his answer is that we do not need to worry about that because there is a way round it by leading the person who took the precognition, we must know the machinery for it and how to cross-examine. Surely we must cross-examine and give the witness whose credibility is being attacked the chance to defend himself. I am prepared to leave the matter at that now and let the Minister write to me about it. I know that it is always a nuisance, but I should be grateful if the Minister wrote to me about that before Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not press amendment No. 6. Subject to the proper procedures, selection and so on, I shall return to the point later. I am still not convinced by the Minister's argument that the matter is being
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>58</span>
considered by the Law Commission. He made a root and branch attack on the idea that a precognition should, for the purposes of challenging credibility, be included in the definition of a statement. He has still not explained why, if that idea is so unacceptable, it should be allowed in the other code. I am a little surprised that he has not been unable to agree with the proposition that if the one is anathema, the second must be similarly classed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment I shall be willing, but not happy, to help the Committee progress by withdrawing amendment No. 6. I reserve the right, if selection favours me, to return to it when we have had an opportunity to assess what the Minister says in correspondence in the intervening period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that I was prepared to rest content on amendment No. 4 and I shall do so, although I have some thoughts on what has been said. As I have not tried to reintroduce the Scottish Law Commission concept, which allows the courts to strike out evidence as inadmissible if the principal witness is not led in evidence, it is merely a matter of protecting the rights of the other party. The Minister was adamant that they are fully covered, particularly by clause 4 and I am happy to accept his assurances. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 5, in page 1, line 24, leave out subsection (3).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not a matter of substance. I presume that the Minister will explain that his amendment, which seeks to remove a reference to the Administration of Justice (Scotland) Act 1933 and insert instead a reference to the relevant section of the Court of Session Act 1988, takes account of the fact that there is a codification measure currently wending its way through Parliament. We are all in favour of codification and I am happy to learn of the introduction of what must be a very technical amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose that it is long-hallowed custom and tradition, but the amendment refers to legislation—the Court of Session Act 1988, as the Minister calls it—which does not yet exist. According to my information, that Bill has completed its passage through another place where it began and has not yet had its Second Reading in the House. It is purely a matter of codification and unless something extraordinary happens, it will complete the rest of its stages speedily. I am curious about the habit of popping in references to statutes that are not yet statutes in the happy assumption that Parliament will do what is expected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall probably retreat quickly on my amendment. I tabled it because I did not understand what is a technical matter. It would be helpful if the Minister would put a brief explanation on the record. I consulted the notes on clause 2, with which he kindly
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0039">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>59</span>
supplied us. Although subsection (3) is largely technical, those who composed the notes set about it with considerable energy. A great deal of space has been taken up in the effort to explain it. The Minister will no doubt confirm if I am right, but I believe that under clause 2, all statements are admissible, but under the Court of Session rules there is a special and privileged class of admissible heresay evidence, including certain documents and so on, which are self proving. In such circumstances, a distinction must be made between general admissible heresay evidence and that which is not only admissible but has the magic property of being self proving. The rather arcane and difficult-looking subsection is designed to make that definition and to tidy up that matter. That is my understanding, but, as my understanding can often be defective, I thought it right to table a brief amendment to invite the Minister's comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the appearance of a ministerial amendment—it makes for variety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In relation to the Court of Session Act 1988 this is a drafting point to ensure that the Bill refers correctly to that Act—assuming that Parliament approves the enactment of the Bill. It is competent to table such an amendment at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For my general education, as it is clear that that Act will be an Act before the Bill before us is enacted, what would happen if, through oversight, or some other perverse set of circumstances, the Civil Evidence (Scotland) Bill became an Act, but the Court of Session Act 1988 was not on the statute book? Would that be proper?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, the law would be an ass. It is most unlikely that those circumstances would arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, the Bill refers to section 16(e) of the Administration of Justice (Scotland) Act 1933, that is the power under which procedural rules are made for the admission of written statements in place of parole evidence in Court of Session actions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman may know that the Court of Session Bill is now before this House, having been considered by the House of Lords. That Bill consolidates enactments relating to the Court of Session and, interestingly enough, like the Bill we are looking at today, has its origins in a report by the Scottish Law Commission. That Bill repeals the powers in section 16 of 1933 Act, but re-enacts them in clause 5 of the Bill. If Parliament approves both of those Bills, it is anticipated that the Court of Session Bill will be in force some time before the Civil Evidence (Scotland) Bill. Therefore, section 16 of the 1933 Act will already have been repealed and replaced by section 5 of the 1988 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment ensures that the Bill will refer correctly to the rule-making power contained in the Court of Session legislation rather than the repealed powers in the 1933 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that explanation, I submit to the hon. Gentleman that it is reasonable to proceed as the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>60</span>
consolidation measure is likely to go through fairly soon. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] If the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) wishes to cross-examine me, he is welcome to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We are seeking a word for it—perhaps "anticipatory" legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is sensible that we should implement legislation that will stand the test of time and be absolutely accurate. The amendment is merely technical and is not of enormous consequence. I am certain that it will be correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am unable to accept amendment No. 50. I had assumed that the hon. Member for Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) was trying to establish the purpose of this subsection rather than seriously seeking to remove it from the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At first sight the provisions seem merely technical, but they are important. Subsections (3) and (4) of the clause refine the existing powers of the Court of Session to make procedural rules for the admission of written statements instead of oral evidence. To the extent that the rules can provide for admissibility of evidence, they are overtaken by clause 2(1)(b) of the Bill, which provides for the general admissibility of statements. I assure the hon. Gentleman that an amendment of the rule-making powers in the way proposed in the Bill is necessary. Without that amendment the existing powers would stand in apparent conflict with the Bill, insofar as they purported to allow the making of rules for admissibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments in the Bill to the rule-making powers then go on to provide for the self-proving aspect of documents, as the hon. Gentleman imagined. The existing rules at the moment appear to be generally accepted in practice as having the effect of making documents, such as affidavits, admitted under them as self-proving—that is, capable of being received in evidence without having to be spoken to by a witness. Although, as I have said, that is generally accepted in practice it is not entirely clear in all cases. In addition, there is some doubt whether the existing powers would be sufficiently wide to enable rules to specify that a document is self-proving in isolation from specifying its admissibility. The provisions restate the rule—making powers in a form designed to deal with the self-proving aspect. The Bill therefore deals with admissibility of statements and allows the court to provide, by rules, that an admitted statement can also be self-proving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sought to deal with that aspect of the Bill on Second Reading. I hope that the explanation that I have just given will satisfy the hon. Member for Garscadden and that he will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am, by nature, suspicious. I am particularly suspicious of Tories and even more suspicious of Scottish Tories. Is it coincidence that a subsection is being introduced that provides for short

cuts to be taken, either on rules set by the court of—I wonder—on rules set by the Government, for the handling of debt cases, when the introduction of the poll tax legislation next year, with all its complications, and the threat of collecting the tax mean that a substantial number of debt cases are likely to be enforced by the poll tax authorities, or by local authorities forced to act as agents for the poll tax authorities? There has been speculation that many people will be unable to pay their poll tax for reasons that were debated during the Committee stage of that legislation just over a year ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the nature of the poll tax legislation, there is likely to be a spate of cases for the collection of relatively small debts in every part of Scotland next year. It would be disturbing if the Government were to seek says of making it easier than it should be to collect such debts using the civil debt procedures. I fear that that may be part of the Government's thinking in drafting the subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister take us through exactly what happens at present in dealing with action by a local authority to collect arrears of rates and the evidence that has to be led and provided in those circumstances? Is it necessary for people to appear in court and support the fact that the debt is due, has not been paid, and so on? Will the Minister compare that with the procedures that are likely to result from the legislation? Given the present circumstances, it would be intolerable if the Government could lay down rules for the court to take batches of cases all at once on the basis of a document provided by a local authority's finance officer or a poll tax officer. It is bad enough that the Government use the power that they have in Parliament—despite their minority in Scotland—to impose such legislation on Scotland. It would be worse still if they abused the courts to enforce such pernicious legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The rules that we are discussing are procedural rules: they are made by the courts, not the Government.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Minister for confirming that it is up to the courts, not the Government, to set such rules. How do the courts go about drafting the rules? Does the Lord Advocate—who is of course a Minister—have no say in their drafting? I am a layman in regard to such matters. I doubt whether individual sheriff courts up and down Scotland will make up their mind on how they will handle evidence in different types of civil cases. There must be a centralised procedure for establishing court rules in sheriff courts. How is it done and who does it?Who
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>62</span>

	<p>12.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has done well. This is perhaps not the place to discuss the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson), but what he is driving at is that there is considerable anxiety. To be fair the provision is not an innovation; it was true under the rate collection system and will be so under the poll tax system. Diligence can be done by summary warrant. That may be convenient, but there is always a concern. It is probably the only expedient way, but the basis of the diligence is not an individual court proceeding, but merely the production of written evidence citing a warrant and that is it. I accept that that goes wider than this debate and could be pursued in other ways at other times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The minister is correct in assuming that this is a probing amendment. I am reasonably satisfied with what he said.

Much of the ground has been covered, at least in passing, in the arguments on amendment No. 4. The Government are justified in accepting the Scottish Law Commission's principal recommendation that heresay evidence should be admissable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already expressed my doubts—I put it no stronger than that—and passing concerns about the cross-examination argument. The overwhelming

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>63</span>
need is to get all the relevant and useful evidence before the court and allow the court to weigh it in the balance before deciding what facts are found, proved and what inference should be drawn from them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This matter is not as straightforward as it seems. I referred to paragraph 3.15 of the Scottish Law Commission's report, which sets out a substantial number of arguments against the admission of heresay evidence. Some of those arguments are not very impressive, such as "heresay may be concocted" or "may be superfluous", but undoutedly there are substantial points, many of which we argued about earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument that
	<br><blockquote><p>"heresay is not 'the best evidence'"</p></blockquote>
is swept aside by the Scottish Law Commssion in paragraph 3.17 on the odd ground that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"To support the retention of the rule against heresay on the ground that it is not 'the best evidence' seems to beg the question. At the present time it is not 'the best evidence' merely because the law says it is not the best evidence."</p></blockquote>
There is more to it than that. I am sure that the Minister will support me because when he talked about the evidential weight that would be given to heresay evidence and when he argued that if a witness were available, the court would favour that witness being called and would comment adversely if he were not, he accepted by implication that there is some objective standing for establishing the best evidence. The argument in paragraph 3.17 is not substantial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not become involved in the vexed question of whether evidence on oath is helpful. Such evidence reinforces the majesty of the law and impresses upon people the seriousness of giving evidence—which was the view taken by the recent Select Committee—but we need not discuss that in detail now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some doubts have been expressed on the matter. On Second Reading the Minister was good enough to tell us that
	<br><blockquote><p>"For example, the Sheriffs' Association opposed the recommendation largely on the grounds that hearsay is not the best evidence."</p></blockquote>
The Sheriffs' Association was opposed to the admissibility of hearsay evidence and while I do not ask the Minister to knee jerk to sheriffs, their views are important and it is worth recording that those doubts exist. The Minister also said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Association of Sheriffs Principal was concerned that reform of the law might make the situation more complex. I think it fair to say, however, that its comments were directed more at what it saw as procedural difficulties."</p></blockquote>
I want to give the whole flavour of the Minister's remarks rather than be selective and his interpretation of the opposition of the Sheriffs' Association and the sheriffs principal should be properly recorded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps more interesingly, and most mysteriously, the Minister went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A working party of Court of Session judges also conceded that some judges of the Court of Session held the view that the hearsay rule might, with advantage, be abolished."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 16 May 1988; Vol. 133, c. 737.]</p></blockquote>
That is putting the matter positively.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>64</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Some judges of the Court of Session"</p></blockquote>
thought that it could "with advantage, be abolished". Presumably, they all thought that it could be abolished as a matter of fact as Parliament is sovereign, but if some thought that it could be abolished "with advantage", it is a reasonable inference that some of the Court of Session judges did not want to see it abolished at all. The sheriffs, the sheriffs principal and, by inference, some Court of Session judges oppose that reform and so it should be approached with caution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having issued that caveat, I repeat my earlier remarks, quoting the late Lord Ross of Marnock. It is proper that all relevant evidence should be made available to the court, in the interests of establishing the truth and reaching a conclusion based on justice. We must leave to the court the sensible business of picking through the evidence and making distinctions between the weight attached to various pieces of evidence. I imagine that hearsay will still be less than best evidence, unless there are special circumstances which explain why it has to be hearsay and why it should still be relevant. I am prepared to leave that to the men of skill who sit on the bench and to their directions to a jury, which will operate in that framework and reach commonsense conclusions, although we should monitor that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point was made during the stand part debate on the previous clause and I do not want to labour it. This is not a precedent for what may happen in criminal law. I am a little more at home with criminal law. I practised for many years in the lower courts and I approach with doubt and anxiety any proposal about the admissibility of hearsay there. I do not accept the Minister's distinction that a criminal matter is always important. It certainly is, but he made the counter-distinction that a more relaxed view of the rules of evidence could be taken in, for example, a damages action. That can be argued, but someone's financial security, standing in his firm or livelihood could depend on the result of a case if it is a matter of civil liability in an accident case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to be careful about assuming automatically that the arguments are transplantable into criminal law, even through I tried to do that in my argument on precognitions. That rather undermined the Minister's horror at the proposition that precognitions should be used to attack credibility in civil cases. It is important to recognise that any changes that may happen in criminal law should be established on the merit of the argument. One cannot just switch from criminal law to civil litigation and assume that the arguments are valid for both. Excellent symbolic evidence appears on the front cover of the first report of our proceedings, which shows how easy it is to slip across the dividing line—we are said to be considering the "Criminal Evidence (Scotland) Bill". Presumably that will be a self-correcting error, but it is an interesting example of what can easily happen. Conditioning to Criminal Justice Bills through the long hours of the night, ad infinitum if not ad nauseum, no doubt finally got to our usually extremely accurate 	<i>Hansard</i> staff. However, I broadly accept the principal objectives of clause 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause deals with the admissibility of hearsay evidence. If the measure becomes law there will be some knock-on effects. The Government clearly hope that the success of hearsay evidence in tribunals will result after the Bill is enacted. The success of tribunals has obviously been their flexibility, ability to change and accessibility, so that the public can seek justice and judgments. The public probably have more chance of having some connection with a tribunal than they ever will with formal courts of law. I hope that the changes will be an asset to the courts of law and will introduce flexibility and modernisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hearsay as evidence is relatively new—hence the doubts that have been expressed in previous speeches. It has been pioneered in, for example, industrial tribunals and referrals to the Sheriff from the childrens' panels. Justice has been not hampered but advanced by the precedent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One problem about courts is their rigidity in structure, and the formality of the procedures. The tribunals have been a refreshing and dynamic force for change. If the ability to lead hearsay evidence is introduced, it will create a wider pool of available evidence for courts, but they alone will still judge the quality of that hearsay evidence and accept or reject it on its merits. It will be judged on the credibility or reliability of the witnesses and the evidence that they give.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those matters can safely and properly be left to the courts. We should remember that we are discussing civil matters. If they were transposed into criminal matters, it would be a different kettle offish. Although the Minister has given no assurances on this matter, the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) reiterated a point that deserves reiteration, that agreement obtained by the Minister in civil matters may not be repeated in criminal matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Civil litigation is different from criminal law, where the liberty of the subject is often at risk. Accordingly, the evidence in commercial matters and disputes lacks strength. The ability of the judge to admit hearsay evidence is important in such cases. Will the greater flexibility of evidence that he seeks lead equally to a greater flexibility in the attitude of the Scottish Legal Aid Board in granting legal aid? What changes does the Minister expect in the attitude of the SLAB as a result of this legislation, and will the Government issue any advice or instructions to it following the changes made by this Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If hearsay evidence is now to be accepted, we are entitled to ask what effect that will have on the Scottish Legal Aid Board when it decides whether to grant legal aid applications. We shall deal with the legal aid system in much greater detail later, but these are practical problems that need a solution, and I pass them on to the Minister. I draw to the Minister's attention the view of one of my constituents who is a solicitor and states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At the moment the Legal Aid Board will put a case out to a Reporter for an Opinion as to whether there is a probabilis causa before they will determine a legal aid application. In many cases
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>66</span>
it is becoming almost to the stage where you have to convince the Legal Aid Board that you will win your case before Legal Aid is granted. They will not consider a case until there is corrobortion on all the points of the case. Obviously the need for corroboration will be dropped by this Bill but is very important that guidance is given to the Legal Aid Board to cover this point and make sure they are not still enforcing at the moment but will accept that corroboration is no longer required."</p></blockquote>
In other words, it would be crazy if the Scottish Legal Aid Board were operating under different rules or guidelines while the courts were changing to a more flexible, reformed system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The solicitor also says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I can see this causing many problems because…it is often very difficult to tell whether a case is a 	<i>probabilis causa</i> until such time as the evidence is heard in court since in the absence of the need for corroboration many cases may turn on the credibility of the particular witnesses. You cannot really get an impression of credibility from precognitions taken from witnesses and therefore there may well be a difference between how the Legal Aid Board will view a case purely based on precognitions taken from witnesses and how a Sheriff might view a case based on having heard the witnesses in court and under cross-examination. Obviously this is a matter that cannot really be investigated fully until such time as the new Bill becomes law and is seen to be in operation but it is a point that will have to be closely monitored".</p></blockquote>
I pass that on as a problem that is worrying solicitors in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will any instructions about corroboration be given by the Government to the Scottish Legal Aid Board? I note that the Minister said that parties will not have to corroborate every point of their case, but I believe that something more substantial is needed, specifically to send out to the legal aid boards to ensure that that does not become the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the very practical point raised by my local solicitor, will the Minister tell us how the more informal structure and the modernisation that he is introducing will be reflected and have spin-off effects when practising solicitors apply to the legal aid board on behalf of their clients?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A number of points have been raised on this amendment. The hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) spoke of the success of tribunals, and I echo what he said. He asked about the Scottish Legal Aid Board, and we shall discuss the future regulations under new Clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On guidance, the Scottish Legal Aid Board does not envisage that this Bill will give rise to any problems. The Scottish Legal Aid Board has begun to review the application of procedure for legal aid and it expects that in due course it will examine its procedures for assessing probabilis causa. The probabilis causa does not usurp the place of the court in determining the action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should make it clear that the government are not empowered under existing legislation to direct or guide the Scottish Legal Aid Board in determining applications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to the report, obviously, in some circumstances, hearsay can be the best evidence. The Scottish law Commission report was emphatic in paragrah 3.22, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"we consider that the rule against hearsay, in addition to be being unduly complex, operates unreasoanbly to exclude potentially valuable evidence. We have therefore concluded that reform of the rule is required in the interests of justice."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0043">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>67</span>
If a witness cannot be brought, hearsay evidence may, in those circumstances, be the best evidence available. Of course, it is possible to take evidence on commission, but that is not possible when the witness is either dead or missing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with what the hon. Member for Garscadden said and the theme that he developed about the clause. The existing rule against hearsay, with its attendant qualifications and exceptions, is widely regarded as making the law complex and difficult. More importantly, it was found that it led, in many cases, to a risk of injustice. Against that background, I am sure that the Committee will accept the need for change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause provides a straightforward abolition of the rule against hearsay. As with clause 1 for corroboration, a party will therefore be able to pursue or defend a claim by bringing to the court all the evidence available to him or her, even if some of that evidence is hearsay. The court retains its power to accord appropriate weight to that evidence. This is an important clause, which, like clause 1, makes a considerable inroad into artificial barriers to the consideration of claims.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a good tangential discussion of the clause, as it came up in an earlier debate. We understand what the clause seeks to do and that it is based on a recommendation from the Scottish Law Commission report. I wish to make it clear from the outset that we have no objection to the clause in principle. As I understand it, the simple matter is that it has always been possible to attack the credibility of a witness by showing that he said something on a prior occasion that is different from what he says in the witness box.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just like the Secretary of State for Scotland on devolution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, as my hon. Friend says, just like the Secretary of State for Scotland on devolution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Guilty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) would be a sort of Lord Braxfield figure in relation to that cause. When I come to think of it, the hon. Gentleman, as I understand it, does not believe in devolution either so he would be a soft option, but that is by the way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is now being proposed that, in future, we should be able not only to attack, but to buttress, the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>68</span>
credibility of a witness by putting to him something that he said on a prior occasion—presumably, it would be the same as what he says in the witness box. One could show that the witness has a record of consistency, which is sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I presume that that could be done by hearsay. One could say to someone "and you said that on previous occasions?" Understandably he will say, "Yes, I said that on previous occasions." Presumably, that evidence could be buttressed further by producing the person to whom the witness said it on a previous occasion. Presumably, the evidence could also be introduced as hearsay, by taking it as hearsay from a third party, who had been told it by the second party, to whom the statement had originally been given. I presume it would be proper to do that. I want to be clear that that measure of flexibility would be available to the person who is trying to attack or defend the evidence. If it were put to a witness that previously he had said something different, or similar with good or evil intent—it would be wise to produce the witness who could give such evidence. That would carry more conviction than the asknowledgement of the person who has a vested interest in supporting his own credibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also curious to know whether it would be possible to do that by introducing documentary evidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Such as 	<i>Hansard.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, or a letter to or from a Member of Parliament. I presume that subsequent clauses will make that admissible, although they refer largely to business records, so their application is narrower. Will the Minister comment briefly on that before we nod the clause through?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to raise a point that has been put to me by yet another Angus solicitor. There are quite a few solicitors in Angus and they are all wealthy, as are solicitors throughout Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of my local solicitors wonders whether there is a danger of correspondence between solicitors on behalf of their clients being used in court. Before a litigation appears in court, there is usually correspondence and various actings by the parties and their solicitors, possibly with a view to settlement. Those letters between solicitors are usually closed with the words, "Without prejudice". Although that letter ending is commonly used in Scotland by solicitors acting on behalf of clients in dispute, I undersand that it has no real meaning and that the letter is not protected by any court privilege if the other side wishes to use it. I have read the views of a number of legal authorities on that matter and have come to the conclusion that it is a grey area. At the end of the day, only the courtesy between solicitors prevents letters with the words "Without prejudice" being lodged in court cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, at the moment such letters could not provide the necessary proof without other corroborated evidence. Is a statement made on behalf of a client and contained in a letter now to become an
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0044">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>69</span>
officially admissible item of evidence? The "Without prejudice" situation may not be directly pertinent to the debate, but the clause seems to open the door a little further towards allowing evidence that is now subject to professional restraint. Will the Minister clarify that point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that "Without prejudice" letters can be referred to in court, and that that has always been the case. So I advise solicitors to write cautiously—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With prejudice or with caution?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With caution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I always understood that "Without prejudice" meant that the letter could not be founded upon, so it had some protection. If a solicitor writes to a colleague saying, "I offer your client £300 to go away, but if he wants more I shall fight it to the last witness and the last word of evidence," the colleague could not turn up in court and say that he has had an offer of £300, and invite the court to draw inference about the merits of the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall return to the hon. Gentleman's point at the end of my remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause deals with prior statements made by someone who is subsequently examined as a witness. It deals with such statements in a twofold manner. First, it retains the existing rule whereby a witness's credibility can be attacked by referring to previous statements that are inconsistent with his evidence in the witness box. Secondly, it provides a new rule whereby the credibility of the witness can be supported by previous statements that are consistent with the evidence that he then gives in the witness box.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In dealing with previous statements in that way, the clause corrects what was considered by the Scottish Law Commission to be an anomaly in the present law. Under the current law when a witness has made a previous statement perhaps to a number of acquaintances, for example, and is subsequently examined on that statement when he is giving evidence, the previous statement is admissible as evidence only insofar as it can be used to attack his credibility. Therefore, the evidential value of a previous series of consistent statements is lost insofar as it cannot be used at the moment to support the credibility of the witness when he is actually giving evidence in court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was the point made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), but due weight would have to be attached to the evidence and whether it was disputed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the clause will allow previous statements to be used for either purpose. However, an exception to this broad rule is made for statements contained in precognitions. That is achieved by the definition of "statement" in clause 9 of the Bill,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>70</span>
which excludes statements contained in precognition. That is because a precognition is an account of the evidence that will be available from a witness. It is prepared by someone other than the witness and is thus not a verbatim account of that witness's evidence. I submit that the clause provides for a sensible and uniform treatment of previous statements made by a witness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"Without prejudice" does not bind the person writing the letter to a particular course of action. It can be departed from, but it can also be referred to in court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the new list of rules mean that such evidence could be used in court? That would mean that solicitors would either have to change current practice by dropping "Without prejudice" or find another way round it. Surely the new list of rules will entice such evidence to be used more frequently in the courts. If the Minister is encouraging hearsay, that will be part of it. The change in law will change solicitors' professional practices.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not change the position in relation to "without prejudice", although it does change the position in relation to hearsay cases. Letters marked "Without prejudice" have been produced in courts. The point about "Without prejudice" is that it is not binding upon the person.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Business must be fairly thin for solicitors in east Angus. I am a little worried at the thought of a solicitor in Friockheim, who is busy writing letters "Without prejudice" to his Member of Parliament in the hope of drumming up more business. I have often wondered what "Without prejudice" meant on lawyers' letters. I now understand that it means absolutely nothing. It might bed useful in future if Members of Parliament, when referring to allegations made by their constituents, tagged that phrase onto their letters, in case such letters or statements referred to in 	<i>Hansard</i> are put before courts as evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I made a flippant aside about the credibility of the Secretary of State for Scotland in relation to what he has said about devolution. Would it be possible for a citizen in Scotland to bring a civil action against him for the cost of converting the Royal High school? It was he who spoke in support of and voted for the establishment of a Scottish Assembly and, by inference, the conversion of the Royal High school for such purposes. He now has the power to activate that investment but refuses to do so. We could cite the hearsay evidence from 	<i>Hansard</i> and press releases from Conservative Central Office to show how he supported the principle of devolution and the expenditure of that money. Perhaps we could obtain some free legal advice about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must put the phrase "Without prejudice" in the proper context.

tenants' choice and other Tory housing reforms. It usually relates to offers and statements during current negotiations such as the purchase of a house.

This is a fine example of Opposition twitch. As one moves through a Bill one sees words and immediately thinks, "Ah, we can do without that."

Earlier, I cited the spectacular example of a case involving genuine public interest—allegations of police assault—in which the civil action was settled by the insurance company without consulting the police authority for the understandable reason that the cost of litigation was so exorbitant that it was better to pay the pursuer to go away, without prejudice to the worth or otherwise of the claim. That does not just happen with big cases in the Court of Session. On many occasions I advised a clerk that if one could settle a matter for £500, it would be cheap at the price. If people could be persuaded that they would amost certainly lose and be encouraged to go away with £500 in their pocket, one should not have to risk substantial expenses and have the inconvenience of key personnel as witnesses being tied up for lengthy periods awaiting the proof.

It is common in tribunals to say, "He will certainly win this, but it is just not worth it. If we can get him to take a couple of hundred, let's chuck it in and get the matter settled." Any measure that simplifies and speeds up the process is to be welcomed. Clause 5 and the amendment attempt to do that.

With your permission, Mr. Martin, it may be convenient to take the debates on the amendment and clause stand part together. It may shorten our proceedings if I raise one or two issues about clause 5 as a whole, if that is acceptable to you, Mr. Martin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

business? We all think of business records as the cash or stock records of a limited company. Clause 9 defines "business" as "includes trade or profession." I presume that that would include the correspondence of Members of Parliament. Part of my business is to answer constituent's letters—that is what I am elected to do.
