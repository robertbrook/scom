<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cumbernauld and Kilsyth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 177, in page 9, line 29, at end insert—
<ul>
<li>"(h) the function of consideration of matters relating to remuneration of staff and conditions of sevice;</li>
<li>(i) the function of administration and co-ordination of general education policy;</li>
<li>(j) the function of the operation of appeal committees set up under section 28(d) of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980;</li>
<li>(k) the function of granting of allowances, bursaries, and other financial aid to assist persons to take advantage of educational facilities;</li>
<li>(l) the function of opening and keeping Records of Needs in respect of children or young persons who have pronounced specific or complex special educational needs in the terms of section 60 to 65F of the Educational (Scotland) Act 1980;</li>
<li>(m) any other function relating to professional areas or to the management functions which extend beyond the interests of an individual school.".</li></ul>
To some extent, amendment No. 177 is a probing amendment. We want to know a little about what is in the Secretary of State's mind. As a trailer to that, in his speech on Second Reading on 2 April, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The House may be interested in the sort of functions that a board might obtain if it had the approval of parents as a whole. I can give examples, which are not meant to be an exhaustive list. It could seek powers over the responsibility for selecting staff below the level of assistant head teacher. It could seek responsibility for charging for the use of school premises out of hours, or for maintenance of school premises. It could seek responsibility for discipline and school rules, and for associated matters, and for determining the format of reports to parents. Most importantly, a board could seek the responsibility, if it so wished, for all matters covered by the running cost budget for a school."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 12 April 1988; Vol. 131. c.41.]</p></blockquote>
That list may not have been exhaustive, but it was extensive. I should like to hear more from the Minister about that matter when he replies to the debate.<br><br>
The amendment seeks to ensure the provision of adequate education. It is important that certain functions are not delegated to school boards but are retained as education responsibilities. The provision of education for children with specific of complex educational needs illustrates that point.<br><br>
The agencies involved in the assessment and diagnosis of a child's special educational needs operate on a regional basis. We have referred to that point before. For example, the child psychology service, which is well-developed in parts of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 484</span>
Strathclyde and other regional authorities, is founded on a regional basis. Likewise, the advice given to head teachers and heads of departments in secondary schools on aspects of their work is given by specialist advisers located at regional level, as is the management. The management is outwith the school: ultimate management and responsibility for the school lies with the education authority.<br><br>
This proposal could lead to confusion and loss of efficiency if such agencies have to play their part in a locally operating procedure. I cannot believe that that is the Government's intention. However, the Secretary of State more than hinted at that—he was quite clear about it—in his Second Reading speech.<br><br>
The main trend in the provision of special education has always been towards integrating into mainstream schools children with special educational need. That is absolutely right. Children with special educational needs frequently incur extra expense for schools, such as the provision of ramps or specialised equipment. If school boards were given power to decide who should be integrated into their schools, they might decide against the integration of pupils whose needs require considerable expenditure. That would represent a serious backward step in the development of special education.<br><br>
As education authorities—not school boards—are the employers of staff, it is appropriate that matters involving teachers' salaries and conditions of service should be dealt with by them. I am sure that the Minister is not proposing that such matters be taken out of the national context. However, to make certain, we should like to help the Minister by inserting this amendment.<br><br>
Management lies firmly with the regional authority, which should be in charge of administration and co-ordination of general educational policy, the operation of the appeals committees set up under the Education (Scotland) Act 1980, and the granting of allowances, bursaries and other financial aid to assist people to take advantage of education facilities. It should also be in charge of opening and keeping a record of needs of children or young persons who have pronounced specific or complex social and education needs under section 65 of the 1980 Act.<br><br>
It is important to get these matters right, and that those who serve on the board are clear about what the board is to do. Any confusion over that will detract from the effectiveness of the school boards system that the Government seek to introduce. The list in clause 15 does not go far enough, and our additional list is intended to clarify matters. I hope that the Minister will say that he has accepted our arguments and will accept the additional paragraphs. If so, he will have added to the quality of the legislation and clarified the role of those who will serve on school boards. I am interested to see how the Minister views the development of the delegated functions of school boards. I am not too enthusiastic about the list that he set out on Second Reading.<br><br>
This is a probing amendment, although it is intended also to improve the Bill. I hope that the Minister will see it in both lights, and that he will be helpful in going through the list.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I1019">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 485</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can probably help the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) in respect of his request for assistance on how we see delegation operating. I do not think that it is necessary to accept his amendment. I should be happy to consider any proposals to clarify and improve clause 15(2) to make matters relating to delegation as comprehensive as possible. The amendment represents a confused collection of points. I shall go through them item by item, as the hon. Gentleman requested.<br><br>
First, on remuneration and conditions of service, the education authority will remain the employer. We do not intend that decisions on the determination of teachers' salaries and conditions should be delegated to boards. They are matters for a contract of employment. Under the existing provisions of the clause, the board is not the employer of school staff. Decisions about national terms and conditions could not be delegated because, as the hon. Gentleman said, they are not authority functions. However, the amendment goes further than the hon. Gentleman suggested. It seeks to forbid boards considering terms and conditions. Why? Authorities may find it helpful for boards to consider the issue and communicate their views to the authority.<br><br>
Secondly, the hon. Gentleman wishes "general education policy" to be removed from the arena. That is misconceived. Even if an authority contemplated such a delegation, it would be impossible. The Bill allows delegation of functions only in relation to a school and general education policy is not a function in relation to a school.<br><br>
Thirdly, if the Opposition wish to exclude parents and teachers from forming part of an appeal committee for decisions taken in a school, they can rest assured. That is already impossible by virtue of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980. In any case, boards would not be involved in appeal procedures by "delegation", as section 28(d) of the 1980 Act puts a duty on authorities to form appeal committees, and gives them power to call on parents and others to serve on those committees. It is as a result of the authority carrying out its existing functions that such committees are formed. Delegation has nothing to do with it.<br><br>
The fourth item about which the hon. Gentleman was worried was the granting of financial aid. He did not say much in his opening remarks, and I do not understand why he wishes to prevent authorities from delegating detailed local management of assistance schemes. If boards were willing to take on those chores, I should have expected authorities to be delighted.<br><br>
Fifthly, on the record of needs, I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's intention, but I assure the Committee that there is no need for concern. A record of needs is a complex, professional assessment, which is made to assist in determining what schooling is appropriate for the child involved and to which school or schools he should be sent. It is by definition, not a function that relates to a particular school. Therefore, that function could not be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 486</span>
delegated—even if a board wished to seek such delegation.<br><br>
The last item in the amendment gave the game away. Having gone through the motions of trying but failing to find something that could be justified, the hon. Gentleman resorts to the phrase "any other function". I assume that it is woolly rather than mischievous drafting, because the hon. Gentleman would never be mischievious. It would appear to prevent the delegation of anything at all. It would encompass almost anything done in a secondary school, that could be said to extend to the interests of its feeder primaries. This part of the amendment is clearly tailored to prevent co-operative working between boards. Only a few clauses ago, Opposition Members told the Committee how keen they were to promote that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Worthington (Clydeband and Milngavie)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister be kind enough to go through the list of the delegated powers that he believes that it would be appropriate for the school boards to take over?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did ask that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed you did.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am not aware that I asked for anything.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Knox. The hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) caught me unaware with his sedentary intervention. The amendment is a mixed bag. There is no cause for alarm, and I ask the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth to withdraw it. In answer to the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) there are a number of responsibilities that the boards could consider taking on. I mentioned some of them on Second Reading. They include involvement in discipline matters, budgetary decision-making within the school; in fact almost any aspect of the running of the school that is not deliberately made off limits by the provisions of the Bill. It will be obvious to the hon. Gentleman from the Bill—and, I hope, from our deliberations during this sitting—that there are several opportuntiies for education authorities, by mutual agreement with the boards, to ask boards to take on responsibilities that would be more appropriately carried out at local level. There will be a wide variation in the extent of the powers that boards take to themselves according to the composition of the boards, geographical location and so on.<br><br>
The fact that the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie asked the question is revealing in itself. The thrust of Opposition amendments has been to try to prevent boards from taking on delegated functions, and the Opposition are in danger of finding themselves at odds with COSLA, which has made it clear that it does not object to delegation in principle. No doubt functions that might be delegated would be subject to discussions on the conditions that would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I1020">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 487</span>
be attached and what would be appropriate in local circumstances. It is with that in mind that we have framed the legislation. Rather than producing a prescriptive list of functions that may be delegated, we have gone for the freedom-maximising stance of limiting matters that may not be delegated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McAlltion <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister discounted the function under paragraph (<i>1</i>)—defining the special needs of pupils—being delegated to a school board. He said that that function did not relate to particular schools and that therefore, it would not be delegated to school boards. He did not apply the same principle however to other parts of the amendment. For example, paragraph (<i>h</i>) provides for
<br><blockquote><p>"the function of consideration of matters relating to remuneration of staff and conditions of service".</p></blockquote>
That does not apply to a particular school; it applies to schools throughout an education authority's area. The Minister said quite clearly that while that function would remain under the control of the education authority through the employment contract, there was nothing to prevent boards from considering the issue. What on earth can a board have to say about the remuneration and conditions of service of staff at its school? The Minister seemed to be hinting that education authorities should be listening to boards that may say that teachers at its school should be paid less or more, or work for longer hours.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said absolutely clearly that that function would not be a matter for delegation, but that there was no bar on the board giving consideration to the matter and offering advice. I understood that the Opposition believed that school boards should have a right to be consulted and to express opinions on any matter concerning the running of the school. Are we to understand that salaries or conditions are off limits? That appears to be the import of the hon. Gentleman's defence of the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not a case of what is "off limits" to a school board. The Minister is arguing that school boards should be involved only with issues that directly affect their schools and not with general issues that affect the whole education authority area.<br><br>
The conditions and employment of staff in the education authority area are matters for the education authority and for the contract of employment. Anyone who lives within an education authority area is free to comment on the employment conditions of staff, but if the Minister is saying that school boards have a specific role to play, he must spell it out. Is he suggesting that there should be a differentiation between employment conditions and salaries for teachers at different schools in the same education authority area? That seems to be the gist of his argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am suggesting that the Committee should reject the Opposition's amendment that seeks to forbid school boards from discussing terms and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 488</span>
conditions. That is not in line with the view that Opposition Members expressed on boards having a right to be consulted and to express views on those or any other matters that are the education authority's responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again the Minister misrepresents what the amendment seeks to do. It does not prevent schools boards from discussing anything that they wish to discuss; it prevents them from taking over the function of consideration of matters relating to salaries and conditions of employment for teachers. That is a different matter. The Minister seems to suggest that there is a role for a school board within the function of determining wages and conditions for teachers in its school. That may enable him to argue that conditions in one school could be different from those in another in the same education authority area. I am merely pointing out the contradiction in the Minister's argument because he said that delegated functions should be those that relate to a particular school only.<br><br>
That contradiction will be highlighted later when we come to granting bursaries and other financial aid to assist pupils to take advantage of education facilities. I believe that the Minister said that if boards were willing to take on that function that was fine by him, but how will boards do that? Bursaries and grants are usually left within an education authority area for all pupils in the area. The Minister seems to say that sets of grants and bursaries should be attached to a particular school and that the school board should be given the job of distributing them only to pupils in its school, thereby cutting out pupils in other schools in the area. That is woolly thinking. The Minister must make clear what school boards will do when awarding bursaries. At present they are awarded by committees based on the education authority, which cover the whole area. Any pupil within an education authority area can qualify for a bursary if he meets the conditions, but the Minister suggests that only pupils in a particular school could qualify for bursaries if they were delegated to particular school boards. That is nonsense.<br><br>
The Minister must clear up the school board's role. If the delegated function to school boards can relate only to the activities of that school, there should be no role for school boards to give their views on the general wages and conditions that apply throughout the education authority or on the bursaries and grants distributed to pupils throughout the area. They are matters for the education authority, which is elected on a wider franchise than school boards, and therefore should be left to the education authority. That is the purpose of the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain more fully the areas that
<br><blockquote><p>"shall not be delegated under this section".</p></blockquote>
Will he elaborate on the meaning of "function" and the difference between "function" and the school board using advisory powers? I realise that there will be difficulties. Subsection (2) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"There shall not be delegated under this section …</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(e) the funtion of discontinuing, changing the site of, or amalgamating with another school".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I1021">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 489</span>
Paragraphs (<i>f</i>) and (<i>g</i>) also specify limitations.<br><br>
I understand that "function" might mean purely executive powers. It would be impossible to delegate to a single school the right to decide its catchment area or delineated area—I believe that that is the expression used in Scotland. It is highly likely however that school boards will play a major part in any process that decides on "discontinuing" or "changing the site of a school, or catchment area. Does the Minister believe that school boards should not be part of that process?<br><br>
I want a specific definition of the word "function". What are the limits on school boards? Will the Minister also explain subsection 2(<i>d</i>) about pupil assessment, and the strange wording:
<br><blockquote><p>"without prejudice to the competency of delegating decisions as to the manner in which results of assessment are reported".</p></blockquote>
How broad will be the reporting of results? Will it be as narrow as listing the names or competence of children in a particular school, or will it include the nature of compiling the results or carrying out the tests? Paragraph (d) will cause considerable difficulty. The Opposition have frequently said that, unfortunately, the legislation tends towards a confrontational approach. People will deliberate long and hard about the wording and about what lies within the competency of school boards. I want to hear the Minister's views.<br><br>
Clause 15 is an important clause and the Government have included it because they envisage the school board as an evolving institution, but evolving to what? Is it interesting that the Government felt no compulsion to explain, or put in any detail, about the powers that they envisage school boards will assume. I tried to jot down the Minister's remarks. He said that there were items relating to discipline, budgeting and other aspects connected with the running of a school which offered a number of opportunities for the involvement of school boards. There should be more than "a number of opportunities."<br><br>
Throughout Scotland there was total opposition to the ceiling powers in the Government's original consultative paper. The Government said that they had taken note of those objections, but they have not. We have a clause that reinstates the ceiling powers, but the Government do not have the courage to assert exactly what role they envisage for school boards.<br><br>
I am disappointed that the Government have said nothing about what will happen to the major function of many school councils, which relates to discipline, exclusion and non-attendance at school. We must examine the consequences of establishing school boards and excluding non-attendance from their powers or remit. That is a thorny issue for local authorities as it involves the collaboration of different agencies, such as the children's panel, the social work department and different sections of the education department.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
It is a pity that the Pack report, which was produced many years ago, was not picked up systematically by
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 490</span>
local authorities or by the Government. After school boards are established, I see a difficulty in dealing with non-attendance at school. Despite the many initiatives and pilot projects of local authorities under urban aid, little developed thinking has occurred in the Scottish education system about the right way for local authorities to deal with non-attendance.<br><br>
A COSLA working party some years ago saw school councils having an enhanced role in dealing with non-attendance. I did not support that view, but we are now leaving a colossal issue to fall even deeper into limbo. I have raised the issue before, but have never succeeded in stimulating a response from the Minister. Usually it is quite easy to stimulate a response from him, but he is distinctly muted on this matter. I wonder why that is so, given the enormous work that he has put into the Bill, downgrading other work such as nursery education because of the importance that he attaches to the management of schools? [<i>Interruption.</i>] The Minister is laughing, but in a letter to me he said explicitly that nursery education was to be given less attention because of the pre-eminence of issues such as school boards. For one who is never reticent, the Minister is now displaying a curious reticence.<br><br>
How does the Minister see the issues of discipline, non-attendance and school exclusion being decentralised to school boards? Is the suggestion serious and does he feel that the school boards can genuinely implement it? Or will local authorities have to take it on and set up other bodies to deal with non-attendance? If that is so, we must examine the Government's views on the cost implications of school boards. Work that has been done previously by volunteers on school councils will perhaps have to be picked up by paid officials in future, and that will involve staffing consequences.<br><br>
That may link with a later new clause that will allow the establishment of area school councils. It has been proposed by Government supporters as a way of dealing with issues that go beyond the purview of a particular school board. I shall be grateful for a detailed response from the Minister on these matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) is largely a probing amendment to discover more about the functions of school boards. I speak as one who was opposed to the idea of the ceiling powers originally proposed by the consultative paper last summer. However, having listened to the speeches on the amendment so far, I am a little uneasy, about the comments of Opposition Members, not about the approach of my hon. Friend the Minister. The Government have decided not to proceed with the ceiling powers and I strongly support and commend that approach.<br><br>
I did not wish to see ceiling powers in place, I hope that school boards will have as much freedom as possible to exercise their functions. As I see it, my hon. Friend the Minister has sought to put a ring fence around what the school boards may do, limiting them to certain areas. I much prefer this approach—telling the boards clearly that their powers
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I1022">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 491</span>
do not extend to certain areas but giving them much more freedom of movement and discretion within other areas. For the purposes of the effective and positive functioning of the boards, that is preferable to the approach sought by the amendment of specifying the functions of the school board.<br><br>
Even in areas such as the one that I represent in Grampian, where school councils have operated reasonably well, especially in terms of machinery and structure, members serving on them have felt some frustration as to what they can do. I believe that the Bill, in describing and specifying the functions which school boards do not have, will give members of the boards a greater feeling of freedom and discretion within the areas which, broadly speaking, all members of the Committee feel that it is right for the boards to have.<br><br>
The amendment is useful in setting out the different approaches that may be needed. However, I strongly support my hon. Friend the Minister: I welcome the definition of the functions which cannot be extended to school boards, which falls in line with my comments on the consultative paper. I believe that the Bill is correctly drafted, although I accept that there may be debate about details which have been excluded. The structure of the clause is right. It will give school boards more freedom and lead to more constructive active participation by those who will eventually be elected to them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was pleased to hear the right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) say that he was uneasy again, but I was disappointed to hear that he was uneasy about our comments, not those of his hon. Friend the Minister. I do not want to be dramatic about it, but this clause is the Trojan horse of the Bill. We have had the debate about ceiling powers and floor powers. We have had the consultation exercise. Then we saw a massive Government climbdown in the face of informed education opinion in Scotland. But now we have clause 15.<br><br>
We are trying to make a serious point. We accept the areas which have been excluded from delegation to the school boards. They are major functions of the education authority and it would not be appropriate now, or in the near future, for any of those functions to be delegated to the school boards.<br><br>
Amendment No. 177 attempts to highlight the deficiencies in clause 15 as we perceive them. My hon. Friends have put forward ideas and proposals in an attempt to probe, which suggests that for good political reasons the Government have decided to ignore much of the earlier debate. The aim of the clause is clearly to consolidate the floor powers, and at an early date education authorities and school boards will be locked into battle on a number of major issues and functions which may or may not be delegated to school boards. This is a serious point and it is not right for the Minister to attack us and put the onus of proof on our comments. He must justify so many important areas in education being up for grabs in future discussions between school boards and the education authorities.<br><br>
The granting of allowances and bursaries is a function which must be kept within the education
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 492</span>
authority. An authority considers priorities over a wide area, including social and education needs. There clearly must be a central focus for the assessment of need and the distribution of the resources. Does the Minister really suggest that in the next two or three years that function will be delgated to individual school boards, which can then make decisions about their own catchment area, their set of priorities and their needs without any regard to the overall finances available within the education authority for such student support? It would be nonsense to suggest that that could happen. However, clause 15 is structured in such a way that a school board could suggest to the education authority that such decisions should be delegated to it.<br><br>
It is not good enough for the Minister merely to tell us not to worry because most of these areas are considered anyway under general education legislation. He must recognise that we are dealing with a variety of education authorities and a variety of schools throughout Scotland. Some school boards may enthusiastically embrace all the ideological concerns that preoccupy the Minister at present, and that would quickly lead to a situation where some of the issues that we have discussed which are not specifically excluded in clause 15 could be a matter of debate between the education authority and the school board and eventually the education authority and the Government, especially if the former refused to delegate such functions to a board.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) stressed that serious issues are involved here, and in his quick run through the amendment the Minister has not reassured anyone. It is clear that an important item on the education agenda is the possible transfer of these functions to school boards.<br><br>
My hon. Friends have spoken about children and young persons with special needs. School board should play a vital role in the administration in its area of education for children with special needs, but that function should be retained by the education authority. It is the only organisation which can have an overview. It can review priorities and it will have a key notion about need that can be related to financial expenditure. In a world of equal opportunities we cannot contemplate the possibility of school boards embracing all of these matters without due regard to the centralised role of the education authority. It would be an injustice to the many young people who need positive help. It would not serve any useful purpose or advance one of the finest aspects of edcuation in Scotland the provision for special needs.<br><br>
Clause 15 paves the way for the return of ceiling powers. The Minister should further identify the areas that will not be included for further delegation. If he does not do so, he will simply confirm our suspicions that the issue is a Trojan horse. As such, it will allow him to satisfy his ideological interests over the next few years. However, those are not necessarily the educational interests of the people whom the Opposition seek to represent.</span></p>

<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Lewis Moonie (Kirkaldy)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is always delightful to make the fifth or sixth contribution to a debate. We need not debate the Minister's intentions on ceiling powers—we all agree that he intends to introduce ceiling powers if he thinks that he can get away with it. Fortunately, judging from the views of the Conservative party, he will not be able to do so for some time.<br><br>
The Minsiter has been a little unfair in considering some points, because important principles are at issue. He recognised them, at least tacitly, in Committee, but now that we have formalised one or two, he appears to reject them. The Minister said that school boards will have no say on terms and conditions of service and remuneration of staff. What, then, are they supposed to do? Are they to be merely a small collection of local busybodies, searching for work for their idle hands to do? Will they say, "Let's have a look at what the teachers are doing and perhaps submit a report on it"? The idea of an education authority dealing with 200 reports on the way in which terms and conditions apply to each school is laughable. That is not an appropriate matter for boards to consider, other than in the most informal sense—in their day-to-day relationship with the head teacher.<br><br>
More important is the issue of privacy for individual pupils, and the right for a decision that affects an individual pupil to be taken by professional local authority staff, rather than by other parents, co-opted board members or teaching staff. Teachers may have a role in advising on the subject, but such a deicsion, and especially the reasons for coming to it, should be, kept private. Although the fact that a child receives some form of allowance or bursary may be kept on public records, surely the Minister will accept that each child's privacy should be respected in such a case, as it is the case of assessment in schools. The Bill should include a specific reference to ensure that that privacy is maintained.<br><br>
With regard to special needs, I hoped that the Minister would have seen the need for regional and national co-ordination and for the development of registers, which we are trying to bring about at present.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said clearly—I shall repeat it—that maintaining the record of a child's needs is not a function that relates to individual schools. Therefore, it could not be delegated. Frankly, the Committee's discussions on the subject are simply a red herring. They are irrelevant to the amendment and to the provisions of the Bill. I am happy to reassure the hon. Gentleman on that point, in the hope that other matters may command his attention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point on privacy related specifically to the granting of allowances and bursaries. I am glad to have the Minister's reassurance on special needs. Coming from Abroath, he knows much more about herrings than the rest of us. But let us not go into that matter on a Tuesday morning, when many of us have been up late considering aspects of other important legislation.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 494</span>
One or two members of the Committee are not present—possibly for that reason. The Minister looks a little bleary-eyed, having sat loyally on the Government Bench until 2 o'clock this morning doing his duty, as I did for my party, but not on the Benches—[Hon. Members: "In the showers?"]—Certainly not in the showers. Only dirty folk wash.<br><br>
Unseemly levity is enlivening our proceedings, so I shall return to the amendment. Paragraph (m) is based on the notes on clauses. The Government do not intend management functions to relate to matters that extend beyond the interests of individual schools. We merely wish that to appear on the face of the Bill, so that it is given its proper place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is on the face of the Bill. I shall try to deal with several points that have been raised.<br><br>
My right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) hit the nail on the head when he pointed out that our aim is to ring fence education authorities' functions. We wish also to create space in which boards are free to act. It has become increasingly clear from their speeches that Opposition Members are against boards having freedom and functions, and even against them talking about some matters. That is implicit in the amendment.<br><br>
Although the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) tried hard to get himself off the hook, he had to argue that boards should not be allowed to discuss the terms and conditions of members of staff. [<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Gentleman did—unless he does not support his amendment, which states that it should not be possible for
<br><blockquote><p>"the function of consideration of matters relating to remuneration of staff and conditions of service".</p></blockquote>
to be delegated to boards. The amendment does not say "the determination" but "the function of consideration".<br><br>
It is extraordinary for Opposition Members to suggest that boards should not, for example, be able to take a view that members of staff should be paid more. That stands in stark contrast to amendments giving boards the right to make representations to the Secretary of State about overall expenditure on education.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister concede that giving boards formal powers to consider the remuneration of staff is different from giving them informal powers to discuss whatever they wish? Teachers will find it exceedingly strange for the Minister to suggest giving boards powers to increase teachers' salaries, when his proven track record is of fighting tooth and nail before conceding the decent salary that teachers deserve. A formal consideration of teachers' salaries should be a matter between the employer and employee, and negotiated between the trade unions and employees. There is no formal role for school boards within that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not getting through to the hon. Gentleman. The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) asked me to explain what was meant by functions. The hon. Gentleman
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I1024">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 495</span>
must distinguish between functions that imply the ability to take executive action or decisions and the ability to give consideration to matters. Unfortunately for him, the amendment seeks to prevent boards from considering those matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Formally or informally?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that Labour party is in favour of school boards—although from the Committee proceedings I begin to doubt that—and of their having the power to discuss matters and be consulted on them. But the hon. Gentleman now says that boards can discuss matters, provided they do not do so formally. That is a new restriction on the rather wishy-washy, watered-down view that the Opposition had of school boards. I give way to the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) so that he can rescue his hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McFall <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: To what end will school boards discuss such matters? Will they consider an issue and say, "That was interesting", then put it aside? Or will they say, "We have looked at the matter and teachers should get more money"—or less money? The purpose of our probing is to find out the purpose of the discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may as well ask what is the meaning of life. He asks what is the purpose of the discussion. A school board may have a discussion in order to advise the local authority, and the local authority may ask the board for its view. There is no reason why a school board should not discuss any matter that is relevant to the functions and operation of the school and communicate its views to the education authority. In line with earlier provisions in the Bill, the education authority is under a duty to take account of those representations. The purpose of the discussions is to give the parents and members of the school board a voice in education, which is the purpose of the legislation. That is why I am surprised at the view that Opposition Members are taking at this stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has said that this measure is about parent power. That is a term with which we do not agree. Is the Minister saying now that parents can discuss an issue so that they can have a material influence on the conditions and pay of teachers in Scotland?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman will remember from our consideration of clause 1, the boards do not consist just of parents. We are talking about discussions by the board and the functions of the board. The board consists of parents, teachers and representatives from the community. The hon. Gentleman will also recall from earlier discussions that we have given the boards the ability to make representations on almost any aspect of the running and functions of the schools. That would obviously include matters such as numbers of staff, levels of remuneration, terms and conditions, and anything else that the boards think would be helpful. We are doing that as a deliberate
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 496</span>
policy to provide a voice for the school board members.<br><br>
The amendment seeks to go further than the Government are inclined to go in the Bill in extending the ring fence described by my right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) to include the right to discuss matters such as levels of remuneration of teachers. That is extraordinary. Far be it from me to interpret Opposition policy on these matters, but Opposition Members seem to be standing on their heads in terms of what they have been busily assuring the people of Scotland was their position. They now seek to limit further those functions which may be discussed. That is very much at odds with the rather wise document produced by the Labour party in England.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To which of our many wise documents is the Minister referring?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was referring to the document on parent power that the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) was quick to dismiss as—to paraphrase the <i>Glasgow Herald</i>—something produced by Jack Straw which did not, of course, apply in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister must not refer to a Member of the House by name.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Know. I was quoting what appeared in the <i>Glasgow Herald,</i> but you are right to require me to point out that it referred to the hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is dangerous to quote the <i>Glasgow Herald.</i> Is it in order to do so, Mr. Knox? Some awful people write in it. For example, Stewart Lamont is filling the paper with theological nonsense at present. It is dreadful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is certainly in order to quote the <i>Glasgow Herald</i> or any other document of that nature.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth has balanced my remarks on the <i>Glasgow Herald</i> with his own view of that newspaper.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
The hon. Membere for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) asked me to say a little more about the specific functions that have been excluded from delegation, particularly the issue of employing or dismissing a member of the school staff. That provision maintains the liabilities and responsibilities of the education authority as employer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not ask the Minister any such thing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman if he wishes to intervene.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I1025">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 497</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must have confused me with someone else.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the record will clarify that, but I think that the hon. Gentleman asked me to say a little more about the functions that would be off-limits and explain why that should be so. If he does not want me to do so, I shall not detain the Committee and we can progress.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) asked about staff remuneration. We have probably dealt with that in enough detail in the exchanges that we have just had. The hon. Gentleman was particularly worried about bursaries and assisted schemes being delegated to school boards. He asked me to give examples of the type of assisted scheme that could conceivably be delegated to local level. One example would be assistance with transport to school under section 50 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980. Clearly, if the busary scheme applied to a range of schools, it could not be delegated to a single school, but an authority might want to delegate to local management the collection of applications of the initial sifting of potential candidates. It is unlikely that, as a matter of policy and preference, boards will seek to carry out such tedious tasks, but local authorities might wish to delgate to them and the two parties would have to consider that.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish), who has just left, was also worried about bursaries. I was fascinated by his analogy—he seemed to have me delivering a ceiling in a Trojan horse, which is a new interpretation of classical mythology.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie), who is also no longer with us, was worried about busybodies in respect of discussions that might take place on teachers' remuneration. He pictured busybodies sending hundreds of unwanted reports on teachers to education authorities. That is a good hint as to the attitude of Opposition Ministers to the Bill. They regard parental involvement and discussions and the deliberations of the boards as an irritation to education authorities. The Government regard them as a way of bringing the education authorities to account.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Minister as we appear to have misunderstood each other earlier. The point that he was dealing with at that time was not raised by me but by another hon. Member, but I should be grateful if he would respond to the points that I did make, particularly with reference to the issue of function. I say that because I want to clarify in my own mind what is meant in subsection (2) by:
<br><blockquote><p>"(e) the function of discontinuing, changing the site of, or amalgamating."</p></blockquote>
as opposed to the concept of "function" in clause 10, which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Every education authority shall provide to every School Board in their area such information as the Board may from time to time reasonably request relating—
<ol>
<li>to the school for which the Boards are established; or</li>
<li>to the provision of education in the authority's area."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
The boards clearly have a general discussion function within the education authorities. School councils
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 498</span>
have been involved in decisions about issues such as catchment areas and have been delegated the task of suggesting catchment areas for particular schools. Will the provisions in paragraphs (e), (f) and (g) of subsection (2) exclude school boards from being part of the decision-making process for catchment areas and amalgamations?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman posed a number of questions. Perhaps I can help him by reiterating my point about function. Function implies having responsibility for executing or doing as opposed to considering or having views on a matter. Our earlier discussion arose because the amendment seeks to go further than limiting functions and seeks to limit a board's ability to consider a matter such as the terms and conditions of staff. Does that make the position clear?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall read the record.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman also asked what powers could be delegated. The Bill is quite clear on that. Any function
<br><blockquote><p>"in relation to a school"</p></blockquote>
could, in principle, be delegated. I cannot set out a prescriptive list for the reasons that my right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside pointed out. Our approach is to designate those areas which would not be appropriae and to leave it to local authorities and boards to consider what is appropriate in the light of local circumstances. I am not sure whether the hon. Member for Clydeband and Milngavie wants me to go through all the functions in the ring fence and our thinking behind them. If he does, I will willingly do so. If not, I shall sit down.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p>[MR. ALICK BUCHANAN-SMITH <i>in the Chair.</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 188, in page 9, line 33, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(3A) Delegation orders made under subsection (1) above shall not come into effect until three years after the formation of the School Boards to which the orders relate.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take new clause 2—<i>Review of school board powers</i>
<br><blockquote><p>"The powers given to school boards under this Act shall not be altered for a period of five years, after which the Secretary of State shall review school board powers with consideration given to different school categories and sizes.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I dare say that the Minister will resist the amendment, as he resists anything that appears
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I1026">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 499</span>
to impede the implementation of the school boards as he sees it, but we do not seek to do that. We are anxious to create the best possible atmosphere for the school boards to be able to operate, and we intend the amendment to be an aid to that end.<br><br>
The delegation provisions in schedule 3 have major implications for all education authorities. Approached on a positive basis, they provide the opportunity for progressive delegation of appropriate functions by the education authority. They open up the possibility of an agreed process for the development of individual school boards at their own pace, which is what we seek.<br><br>
We recognise that this process would operate on a selective basis, dependent on the capability and desire of individual school boards to undertake additional devolved responsibilities and on the ability of the education authority to justify, sustain and resource the potentially complex administrative and management arrangements involved. I still do not feel that I have persuaded the Minister that these management and administrative difficulties exist, and I am worried that he does not seem to appreciate the complexity of these matters. I have already dealt with that, but I wish to reinforce the point.<br><br>
The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, which supports the amendment, does not oppose the principle of delegation orders. The Minister was right when he made that point, although he announced it as though he were revealing something new and as if supporters of COSLA were supposed to fall over with shock at the revelation. We were well aware of that, and we support COSLA's stand. COSLA does not oppose the provision for school boards to take independent initiatives to seek delegated functions from authorities, but it is strongly of the view that these provisions should not be introduced with immediate effect. They should follow upon the settling-in period required for the effective implemetation of the school board machinery—a point that I made earlier.<br><br>
The work entailed for the education authorities in setting up the administrative, financial and detailed operational arrangements, coupled with the need for board members to familiarise themselves with then-basic responsibilities and establish themselves, will be such that any question of random requests for additional powers would be premature and counterproductive.<br><br>
The Minister yawned at that point, which is worrying, as it is an important matter. COSLA is urging that the delegation order procedure should not come into effect until three years after the formation of the school boards. That would provide an opportunity for the authorities and boards to consider jointly the best way forward in the light of practical experience and would permit a concentration of effort on the immediate task of establishing the boards on a sound footing.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
I believe that that is a good idea. I do not understand why the Minister thinks that he should achieve his objectives in a great hurry. He will surely want to look back on the establishment of school
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 500</span>
boards and say, "I did that—I set out to do that and the boards are in place and working well." It would aid the boards to work well if there were a period of calm and consolidation immediately after their setting up. It is difficult for anything new to fit into an organisation of the size and scale of our education authorities.<br><br>
Some years ago when I worked closely with the electricity supply industry I asked how a new power station was switched on. I was told that that was a good question and that it is difficult to introduce a new power station into the grid. It is not a matter simply of having the station there and switching it on so that it works. It takes much care and time to ensure that the system is not destroyed by the introduction of a huge new megawatt power station. The introduction of school boards is similar to that. A system and structure exists already. We must make additions in a way that guarantees that we do not upset and damage the good elements in the system. We must ensure that the addition will enhance and improve the structure. That is why we are asking for care to be taken.<br><br>
That is the kind of classical conservatism that you would understand, Mr. Buchanan-Smith, but which may fall on deaf ears as far as the Minister is concerned. We want to conserve what is good while we make improvements, additions and changes. COSLA, with its huge experience of administering the vast local authority structure and large education authorities, is saying that we should not have such delegation orders until the system is up and running. Three years is a short period in the lifetime of organisations such as local authorities.<br><br>
The Minister has not done well in accepting amendments this morning, but I am sure that when he considers this amendment he will appreciate its merits and be pleased to accept it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gordon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak to new clause 2, which takes the argument further than did the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg). The hon. Gentleman's closing remarks reminded me of a comment that I received in the west country from a former Conservative supporter who said, "You can say an awful lot of things about this Government, but it is not a conservative Government."<br><br>
There is a dynamic tension on the Conservative Benches between the Minister who wishes to charge ahead with radical new proposals and Conservative Members who are willing to support changes, as I am, but feel that we should give the changes proposed by the Bill a chance to settle in and not, to use an argument diployed on the previous debate, accept this cheerfully as a Trojan horse.<br><br>
New clause 2 says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The powers given to school boards under this Act shall not be altered for a period of five years, after which the Secretary of State shall review school board powers with consideration given to different school categories and sizes."</p></blockquote>
There are two issues to be considered. First, there should be a five-year restriction on the changes to powers given to school boards. We know that the Minister still yearns for his ceiling powers. We also
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I1027">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 501</span>
know that he has not proved that there is a demand for those ceiling powers either within his party or in the country. The five-year constraint gives the Minister the opportunity to take his ideas to the country at the next general election. Unless there is a radical change in the constitution—I do not put anything past the Government—that should take place within the next five years.<br><br>
The Minister believes that school boards should be encouraged to take on powers relating to the management and direction of schools. That matter should be debated fully and extensively throughout the country at the next general election. The five-year period has that definitive value.<br><br>
The second part of my new clause suggests that when and if the plans change, there should be a broad idea, on the basis of five years' experience, about what appropriate changes should take place, according to different schools. The Minister is keen on talking about morality and total freedom and flexibility of choice. They are good, attractive words, particularly to me as a Liberal, but I am frequently reminded that there is a fine line to be drawn between variety and anarchy. It can be argued that it is appropriate to set out broad guidelines for different types of schools. For example, powers appropriate to a large, urban secondary school may be inappropriate for a small, rural primary school. Such factors should be monitored on the basis of experience.<br><br>
Some aspects of the Bill meet the demand from school councils for more effective powers. I welcome and support that component and want to ensure that school boards operate in a constructive manner and achieve some of the objectives that school councils wanted to achieve but were prevented from doing so.</span></p>
<p>[MR. DAVID KNOX <i>in the Chair.</i>]</p>
<p>From representations that I have received I am sure that people do not wish to take over the running of schools. If they did, the constructive relationship between parents and teachers would break down. That relationship has already been developed through school councils and parent-teacher associations and may develop in some schools as a result of this legislation, which provides the powers that were not available to the school council system.</p>
<p>If the Minister has the confidence of his beliefs and convictions, he should accept the basis of the new clause: the legislation should be tested during the full term of a Parliament to see how it works out. That would determine whether his arguments are justified, or whether Opposition arguments, or other arguments within the Conservative party are closer to reality. That will reassure many people who have concluded that, as the Bill will become law, it should be implemented in a constructive manner. They do not want it to be the Trojan horse with the Minister trying to push them down a road that they do not wish to take.</p>
<p>I am sure that on many platforms, the Minister will boast that he has introduced one of the most radical reforms in the management and running of schools, which will increase parental involvement. If he wishes to make that boast, he should also
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 502</span>
boast—as some of his colleagues have tried to do—that he responded to the consultative process. Most of us know that the Ministers proposals were universally criticised, not only from outside, but from within his party. The Minister was forced to modify his stance, but I do not complain about that.</p>
<p>We are entitled to have an assurance from the Minister that, despite the fact that he has not changed his beliefs—I do not expect that—he recognises that public opinion believes that the new law should have a chance to settle down. There should be a period during which we can consider its operation.</p>
<p>The Minister may be anxious to debate raising the powers towards the ceiling. That is a legitimate issue for debate in a general election. I hope that the Minister will debate that robustly in his constituency, because, given the size of his majority, it might be a definitive comment on whether the proposals are acceptable. That is a fair challenge to the Minister. He may argue that he defied the electoral trend in Scotland which affected his colleagues, but he may have put his finger in the dam for four years only. We have yet to discover if that is the case.</p>
<p>The Minister must assure us that he recognises our anxieties and that he believes in the Bill. That belief is fair enough, but there should be time to assess the working of the Bill together with the specified level of powers. There should be no attempt to modify or increase those powers until we have seen how the Bill works. There must be a true manifestation from those operating the system that they want such increases in powers. My clause introduces a reasonable constraint, together with the interval of a general election, between that time and the present.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) studies the Prime Ministers speech to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland he will discover that it is no part of our political philosophy to indulge in boasting.<br><br>
I was interested by the hon. Gentleman's argument for his new clause. He seemed to suggest that I should accept the new clause because I should have confidence in Government policies on parental involvement.<br><br>
If the hon. Gentleman was confident about his argument, which is, as I understand it, that parents do not want any further powers—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcom Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, that they may want the extra powers—that is a change in his stance—but not yet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcom Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that either.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman if he wants to intervene because I misrepresent him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcom Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has put words into my mouth. I said that parents clearly did not, and do not, want the ceiling powers in the Ministers original proposals. They want and welcome some of

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 503</span>
the powers in the Bill, and will try to make them work. The clause refers to the ceiling powers and the potential to increase powers towards the ceiling.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot cope with all this talk about Trojan horses and ceilings. Will the hon. Gentleman spell out those powers that he believes should be deferred for five years? That may help the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should have confidence in his Bill. He has come forward with proposals that he maintains are the result of consultation. The powers, as defined in the Bill, should stand for five years without being changed. That is the point of my new clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am totally dumbfounded by the hon. Gentleman's statement. Is he referring to all the powers available to school boards under the Bill, including the power to take further delegated functions? If so, I am totally bemused about the meaning of his new clause. I can only assume that the meaning is as drafted; to provide for any function delegated to a board to remain inviolate for a five-year period after the delegation order had been made. That would be at odds with the Bill's provisions for the suspension, revocation and amendment of delegation orders. It would give school boards the ability to take the powers that the hon. Gentleman thinks should be available to them, and would prevent education authorities from suspending those powers. I find that difficult to understand. It seems wholly at odds with what the hon. Gentleman has told the Committee in the past few weeks.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
The new clause tabled by the hon. Member for Gordon is so badly drafted that its effect is uncertain. Having listened to him, I am uncertain about what he is trying to achieve. If the hon. Gentleman was correct in his assertion that the people of Scotland did not want these powers soon, now or until the general election, I do not see why he should be concerned about them. They can be obtained only if either the authorities or the school boards wish it, and, if there is any disagreement, the support of the parents is needed to appeal to the Secretary of State. If he is correct that people do not wish to take delegated powers, which I thought he believed until his remarks a few moments ago, he has nothing to fear.<br><br>
I recognise that boards will have to gain experience. The hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth sets out COSLA's position. It wants a working-in period of three years to enable boards to gain experience before they take on complex functions such as the management of the entire budget of the school. But there are other functions that boards may be keen to delegate at an earlier stage. The hon. Member for Gordon made the point that there are differences in what might be appropriate in a rural primary school and a large city secondary school. In a rural school, for example, there may be scope for the board to play a greater role in the management of the use of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 504</span>
school premises out of hours. It would be absurd to say that that could not be delegated for a period of three years.<br><br>
I must ask the Committee to reject amendment No. 188 and the new clause, because they seek once again to be prescriptive and to limit the freedom for local manoeuvre that has been so much a part of Conservative thinking. It is entirely appropriate, in view of the window dressing that Opposition Members have applied to their speeches on their amendments.<br><br>
Opposition Members say that I should not drag school boards and the education system into taking powers that they do not want, which is a suggestion I refute, as I am not dragging anyone in any direction. If they sincerely believe that there is a desire for a period of consolidation, there is nothing in the Bill to prevent that. The Bill is framed in such a way that it can meet every conceivable local circumstance in line with the wishes of the local people concerned. I thought that that was a good principle of Liberalism, but it may not be a principle that Democrats support.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcom Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find the Ministers argument wholly spurious. I am sure he knows that it was spurious, although it was good knockabout stuff. There is a serious point behind the clause, and the Ministers reply has done nothing to reassure those who might have wished for a more constructive response.<br><br>
The Minister has put forward a Bill that will shortly leave the Committee and go on to become law. It is reasonable to predict that that will happen. The Minister has made it clear that the Bill, on the basis of consultation, provides for substantial powers and represents a step forward. The new clause simply suggests that, having defined the powers on the basis of consultation, and after the legislation has gone through this House and the other place, it would be reasonable to let the Bill lie, and operate with those powers for five years.<br><br>
The question which worries many people, is whether the ceiling powers are still in the Bill. The Ministers answer seems to be a definitive yes. As to the Ministers claims and some of his more conservative supporters that their consultation efforts have modified the Bill to the point where the ceiling powers originally proposed are no longer in it, either the Minister is deceiving them, they are deceiving him, or they are both deceiving each other. That is the type of matter on which the new clause seeks the assurance that many people in Scotland want.<br><br>
The Minister attacked me, saying, "The hon. Gentleman says that people do not want these powers in general". I have made it clear, since Second Reading and throughout the Committee stage, that I supported the original proposals in the Conservative party manifesto for Scotland, because they were also in the Alliance manifesto for Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It must be wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcom Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, the right hon. Gentleman for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith)
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I1029">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 505</span>
may be horrified to hear that. I supported the proposals to increase powers for school councils. There are aspects of the Bill that deliver those reforms through the school board system and I welcome that. The Minister is unfair when he suggests that I do not want those reforms, because I have made it clear from the outset that I do. That does not mean that we must accept the whole package. It is possible to read the Bill intelligently and say that some powers are relevant and helpful while others cause concern.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. Will he explain which powers he believes should not be available to the school boards for five years? He has been ducking that question. As he is persuading the Committee that there are still ceiling powers in the Bill, where is the provision for school boards to reject staff from the school? That was one of the ceiling powers that caused immense anxiety during the consultation process.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is where I am seeking the Minister's guidance because I am not sure what variation orders the Minister may seek to introduce under the Bill.<br><br>
This is not a debate where it is particularly useful to score points—the Minister's views are known. The purpose of the new clause is to probe the Minister and get an assurance that there is a defined limitation that will not change significantly regarding the involvement of the school board in any interference in the curriculum and the appointment of staff.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, but we are not in Committee to discuss my views. We are here to discuss the Government's position on the Bill.<br><br>
Clause 15(2)(a) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"There shall not be delegated under this section—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(a) the function of giving employment to, or of dismissing or of removing from a school, any of the staff of the school".</p></blockquote>
As the function of removing staff from the school was one of the ceiling powers proposed, will the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that not all those powers are in the Bill, as he said only a few moments ago?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Bill stands, that appears to be the case. However, I am seeking a reassurance from the Minister that he does not intend to vary those proposals within a period of less than five years. If he cannot give a reassurance, we are entitled to assume that his known views are those of the Government, and that variation orders can be made. The Minister is much more familiar with the workings of the Bill than me and therefore will he give such a reassurance?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman can see for himself that nothing in the Bill gives the Secretary of State power to vary its provisions. Any changes to clause 15 would require primary legislation for consideration by Parliament. It is absurd to argue that somewhere, secretly hidden within the Bill, is the means for the Government to change the meaning of the legislation.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 506</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcom Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I am entitled to seek guidance and reassurance, will the Minister say what statutory instrument changes might be introduced under clause 23(1) that says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Any power of the Secretary of State to make regulations under this Act shall be exercised by statutory instrument which shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament"?</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No doubt we shall come to that clause later. It means that, where there is provision for the Secretary of State to make regulations, such provisions will be made by regulation. Under new clause 2 we are discussing whether the specific functions of the school boards should be available to them for five years. That is how I understand the issue, although it is not what the new clause says. As the functions of the school boards are clearly defined in the Bill, and as those matters which may not be delegated to the boards are also clearly defined in clause 15(2), the hon. Gentleman has no cause for anxiety. He was rather unfair to my right honourable and learned Friend the Secretary of State when he argued that my right honourable and learned Friend was wrong to say that the ceiling powers were not included in the Bill. They are not included in the Bill and there is no regulation-making power available to the Secretary of State to put them in the Bill, as we made clear following our consultation process.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for putting that statement on the record, and I shall refer to it in due course. I am not wholly convinced about how clause 15 will work, but I agree that it makes specific exceptions, which should continue to exist. I still argue however that variations between schools should be allowed only after a decent settling in period. That is the specific point of amendment No. 188, which I support.<br><br>
The purpose of tabling the new clause was to try to obtain an assurance that the Bill will not be used as a vehicle to introduce some of the powers about which we have expressed concern. If the Minister can give such an assurance, and say that any substantial change will require primary legislation, I am happy to accept that. My only plea—it is perhaps not entirely in order—is that I hope that that primary legislation does not come before a general election, but after, when the issue can be fully debated and once the legislation has been in place for three or four years. That was not an unreasonable matter to probe and the Minister has now made a useful statement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's said that school boards have responsibility for appointing staff, and that the power to reject school staff was one of the ceiling powers. But the consultative document said that the "ceiling" would comprise:
<br><blockquote><p>"Responsibility for choosing all members of their school staff without the involvement of authority appointment committees."</p></blockquote>
12.15 pm<br><br>
That has changed in respect of head teachers, deputy heads and assistant teachers. School boards will have the power to be represented on appointment
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I1030">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 507</span>
committees only. They will have the right to reject any nominees on a short leet, therefore they will retain power in some respects. The consultative paper also discusses the ceiling power for appointing school staff and says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Authorities would remain the employers of school staff and be obliged to redeploy or dismiss any person rejected from its staff by a Board."</p></blockquote>
Clause 15(2)(<i>a</i>) says:
<br><blockquote><p>"There shall not be delegated under this section … the function of giving employment to, or of dismissing or of removing from a school, any of the staff of the school."</p></blockquote>
That was never the case. School boards would not have had that power even as a result of the consultative document and ceiling powers. They would have had the power to select staff—that power still exists, potentially, in the Bill. School boards will have the right to be delegated the power to appoint staff; they will only be unable to take on the role of employer. If the Minister says that that is not so he must spell out in detail what would prevent a school board from choosing which members of staff to appoint. They can do that under the Bill as it now stands. The only thing that they cannot do is take on the function of employers, but they can tell the employers which staff to appoint.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It might be helpful if I clear up the matter about which the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) is concerned. He was anxious about the regulations making power over to the Secretary of State and that that would, in some way, enable the powers of school boards to be altered. Regulations can be made under clause 2(3) that deal with membership; regulations can be made under clause 6(8) that deal with public access to board meetings and under clause 17(4) to deal with the form of financial information to boards. There are no other regulation-making powers in the Bill. The Bill makes clear what the functions of school boards should be. I am still not sure which of the school boards' functions the hon. Gentleman is anxious to limit to five or three years.<br><br>
If I have helped the hon. Member for Gordon lay the ghost of the ceiling powers and to recognise that the Bill reflects the wideranging views presented to us during the consultation process, the debate has been useful. I welcome and acknowledge his generosity in making his position clear.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) asked me about the rights of school boards regarding staff appointments. He must differentiate between selecting and appointing. They can make recommendations about removal, but they cannot remove staff. That is clear under clause 15(2)(<i>a</i>).<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) will withdraw his new clause in the light of my assurances. I hope that I can persuade the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) that the freedom enjoyed by local authorities and school boards to make arrangements appropriate to their circumstances will increase if he withdraws his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For reasons entirely unrelated to the Minister's comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 508</span>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Knox. What happened to new clause 2?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was not moved. We have not yet reached it on the amendment paper. If the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) wishes to move it, he can do so formally at a later stage, but I guess that he does not want to. I believe that the hon. Member for Dumbarton wishes to address us on clause stand part.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said to the hon. Member for Gordon that he hoped that he had laid the ghost of the ceiling powers by means of the clause, but we are not convinced. We suspect that the Government are interested in encouraging unrepresentative parents to be members of the boards. That issue has not so far been covered by the delegation proposals, but it is worthy of investigation. We challenge the proposals to grant additional powers to school boards on the grounds that parents have overwhelmingly rejected the ceiling proposals put forward in the consultation paper. The delegation powers are however, in effect, the ceiling proposals, which the parents have rejected. Apparently the Government do not recognise the verdict of Scottish parents.<br><br>
The legislation rules out control of the curriculum. That would be acceptable if taken at face value, but I contend that it is meaningless because parents already have the veto on the purchase of materials, books and other educational resources. That effectively gives them control over the curriculum. The legislation allows school boards to petition for full financial control of the operation of schools. Parents have pointed out that they are not qualified to do that and do not want to do so.<br><br>
On 12 April 1988, on Second Reading, the Secretary of State for Scotland gave an example of functions that the boards might obtain with the approval of parents. He mentioned several, including seeking responsibility:
<br><blockquote><p>"for charging for the use of school premises out of hours".</p></blockquote>
That is a dangerous proposition, but I realise that it is not part of this clause—it is dealt with in clause 14. I hope that a board will not be able to levy a charge other than that fixed by the local authority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right honourable and learned Friend said that boards could seek:
<br><blockquote><p>"responsibility for charging for the use of school premises out of hours, or for maintenance of school premises".</p></blockquote>
That is not the same as determining the charges.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The last part of the Secretary of State's statement reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"Most importantly, a board could seek the responsibility, if it so wished, for all matters covered by the running cost budget for a school. Clearly that power would give a board the kind of overall responsibility for finance that is permissible under the Bill".</p></blockquote>
That concept of overall control of finance is equivalent to the thrust of the ceiling powers. It
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I1031">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 509</span>
may be given to parents who have had no previous connection with or experience of education other than as a pupil. They would be responsible for the disciplining of school staff, perhaps, even including suspension. The Jordanhill experience should warn us of the dangers of the proposals. They are a prelude to opting out, which the Government intend to pursue regardless. That point should be stressed.<br><br>
If the local authority does not grant the application for school board delegated powers, the school board may call for a ballot of parents. A simple majority will enable it to pursue the claim for new powers. The idea of a simple majority was rejected in another place during the debate on the education Reform Bill and the same should apply to Scotland.<br><br>
In justifying the inclusion of a ballot in the procedures, which would increase the delegated powers, the Secretary of State for Scotland acknowledged that parents on many school boards might be unrepresentative. Again, on Second Reading he stated that the Government
<br><blockquote><p>"accepted the basic argument of many parents that if we allowed any increase in the powers of school boards to be determined purely by the parents on those boards, an unrepresentative group of parents might facilitate a major increase in the responsibilities of school boards without the support of the parental community".—[<i>Official Report,</i> 12 April 1988; Vol. 131, c. 31, 41.]</p></blockquote>
Given that the Secretary of State has acknowledged that, it would be wise to inquire into the circumstances that would give rise to such a situation. It would occur where parents were apathetic and did not participate readily in ballots. That would apply to the application for additional powers and unrepresentative parents would, in that case, get their way.<br><br>
In view of the extensive nature of the powers and the fact that parents have overwhelmingly rejected the proposals, it is crucial that the interests of the wider community be protected. At the very least, a ballot requiring a majority of all parents, not just those participating in a ballot, is required.<br><br>
When faced with the issue of unrepresentative parents, the Government make optimistic noises. In doing that, they have ignored the experience of community councils whose history will testify to the fact that it is difficult to sustain a high level of involvement at grass roots. They have also ignored the fact that only 25 per cent. of schools have any parents' association and therefore, few schools have a foundation to build upon. At least the Secretary of State has shown some realism in admitting to the danger posed by unrepresentative school boards. He must face up to that danger and ensure that a majority of all parents in a school vote in favour of the delegated powers before the application is proceeded with.<br><br>
The Government may be relying on the fact that many school boards will be populated by unrepresentative parents. After all, they know the views of parents on school boards and they manifestly do not like them. The Government ignored the clear wishes of the parents on the Inner London Education Authority and they seem to be pursuing their intentions for Scotland in the same way. The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 510</span>
Government are interested in unrepresentative parents and those who will further their ideological assault on the state education system by taking the opting-out path that the Government intend to follow. That is the danger of the delegated powers and that is why we shall vote against the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 15 deals with functions that may or may not be delegated to school boards. The Minister has tried hard this morning to convince some of his right honourable and honourable Friends that those powers do not include the ceiling powers that were included in the consultative process, but he has failed to convince Opposition Members. I hope that he has failed to convince the right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) and that he will see through the Minister's arguments and realise that there is a potential for the essence of the ceiling powers to be delegated to school boards.<br><br>
We should put the Bill in the perspective of the consultative process. The consultative paper envisages a strategic role for education authorities that is not dissimilar from the strategic role that was envisaged for district councils under the recent Housing Bill. The consultative paper sees education authorities taking an responsibility to ensure adequate provision for their areas as a whole and to ensure that a satisfactory curriculum and common services are provided to the schools. However, it clearly states that
<br><blockquote><p>"it is neither necessary nor efficient that the education authority should also exercise control in full detail over the management of individual schools".</p></blockquote>
In other words, just as district councils are no longer to be the providers of housing, education authorities are no longer to be the district providers of education in schools. They are to be progressively disengaged from the day-to-day running of the schools.<br><br>
The paper envisages a similar radical shift in the traditional role of teachers in schools. It says that while it could hardly argue that teachers would have to be disengaged from the day-to-day running of schools and that their professional judgment should not be given due weight in school management, their professional decisions
<br><blockquote><p>"should be open to the scrutiny and responsive to the reasonable demands of parents and the local community."</p></blockquote>
The basis of the radically new approach outlined in the consultative paper was the school board, which was to have
<br><blockquote><p>"a central role in the management of the school."</p></blockquote>
The floor proposals were consultative powers to be given to school boards and dealt with issues such as the general right of parents to have access to information about the running of the school and a say in how the school was run.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
The ceiling proposals outline in the consultative paper are more important for this clause. They deal with the executive powers to be given to school boards. Ceiling powers were to be given to school boards for financial management and staffing. First, school boards were to take
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I1032">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 511</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"direct control over a budget for the recurrent costs of their schools".</p></blockquote>
Within the terms of clause 15, it is still possible for school boards to take over responsibility for the current budget of schools. Secondly, the ceiling powers were to include:
<br><blockquote><p>"Responsibility for choosing all members of their school staff without the involvement of authority appointment committees."</p></blockquote>
As I have said, that has been modified to an extent in the case of head teachers, deputy heads and assistant heads so that school boards may now nominate only on to the committee that appoints those staff members. School boards have the right to veto who can get on to the short leet for such appointments, and that is included in the Bill. Although it has been watered down, the original essence still exists for appointments of head teachers, deputy head teachers and assistant head teachers. The clause allows school boards to pick which staff members are appointed to their schools. The function of employer is the only one that school boards will not be allowed to take on. Even under the ceiling proposals, it was never intended that school boards should take on the function of employer. That was always to remain with the education authority. The ceiling proposals meant that school boards would select and the education authority would appoint staff. In essence, that is still the case under the clause. I hope that those Conservative Members who are anxious about the issue will examine the clause closely and realise that that is so. Far from the Government having backed down in essence, they have not backed down at all. The powers are still there, albeit in a slightly watered-down version, for school boards to take over the financial and staffing management of their schools within the terms of the Bill.<br><br>
The response to the consultative document was almost universally hostile, particularly in relation to the executive functions, or the ceiling powers. The survey from the Education Institute of Scotland showed that up to 97 per cent. of those consulted were opposed to school boards taking on the financial running of the school and the appointment of staff.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman gets on to the EIS survey, which has long been discredited, will he tell us where in the Bill is the power—as laid out in section 3.5.2 of the consultative paper—for school boards to be in the position where authorities would
<br><blockquote><p>"be obliged to redeploy or dismiss any person rejected from its staff by a Board"?</p></blockquote>
That is one of the most controversial aspects of the ceiling powers and it is not in the Bill. If the hon. Gentleman were being fair minded, he would have drawn that to the Committee's attention instead of glossing over it as he has just done.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister were serious in saying that school boards would not be able to select the staff appointed to their schools, that should be one of the delegated functions excluded from the powers of school boards. But it is specifically not excluded. That is why I conclude that there is nothing to prevent a school board from applying to an
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 512</span>
education authority to ask for the right to select the members of staff for their school. Will the Minister confirm that it is possible for a school board under the terms of the clause to apply to an education authority for the delegation of the function of selecting staff who are appointed to the school below the level of assistant head teacher? As I understand it, that is possible under the terms of the Bill at present.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Gentleman says about appointments is correct. I was asking him about the provisions in what have been described in our discussions as the ceiling powers for the dismissal of staff. I was asking him to comfirm that our ceiling proposal which would enable boards to oblige local authorities to redeploy or dismiss any person rejected from its staff by a board is not included in the Bill. That is a fundamental matter which caused much concern and anxiety. I am asking him to have to grace to make it clear to the Committee that he accepts that that aspect of the ceiling powers is not included in the provisions of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is being deliberately evasive. If it is possible for a school board to have the power to select appointments to the school and it does not want an individual appointed to the school, it follows that the education authority must redeploy that member of staff. There is no obligation to sack him, but if he is unacceptable to the school board and cannot be placed in that school the education authority must accept the decision of the school board and redeploy him elsewhere. How else can school boards have the power to select people appointed to their schools?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Dismissal is not about not appointing individuals to a school. Dismissal is about removing people from a school. I am asking the hon. Gentleman to address himself to dismissal. To argue that having the right to appoint a person whom it considers appropriate is the same as being able to dismiss or require the education authority to dismiss a person whom it rejects is erroneous. The hon. Gentleman should acknowledge that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I completely acknowledge that. I understand the Minister's point that it will not be in the school board's remit to apply to the education authority to have existing members of staff dismissed from the employ of the education authority, but it will be within its remit to veto appointments to that school. If there are no other vacancies within the education authority's area it will of necessity be in the board's power to ensure that that person member of staff whom it rejects for the school will be dismissed from the employ of the education authority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Minister whether—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is intervening in his hon. Friend's speech. He cannot ask questions of the Minister at this stage.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I1033">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 513</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that we are talking about appointments over which the school board has power? But we are also talking about the transfer by a local education authority of an individual to a school. The school board has no power there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a fair point. Under the provisions of the Bill, a school board may apply to the education authority to have delegated to it the function of appointing staff to that school. Should the education authority, after that function has been delegated to the school board, seek to transfer a particular member of staff to that school it would be within the remit of the school board to reject that member of staff and to send him back to the education authority. The Minister is drawing fine lines of distinction. He has given way on certain points, but the reality is still that school boards will decide who is appointed to their schools. That may well mean redeployment or even dismissal for some individuals. It will not apply to members of staff who are already at the school before the school board comes into existence, but once the school board has been established and those functions have been delegated to the board, it will control who gets jobs within that school. The Minister cannot deny that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentlman thinks that fine lines are being drawn between what was included in our original consultation paper and what is included in the Bill, why did he and the Labour party describe the Governments position as a climbdown? They are not fine lines at all. We took account of the consultation process. It is included in the Bill and the hon. Gentleman is failing lamentably to argue that the ceiling provision in the original consultation paper form any part of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is either being wilfully ignorant or he is entirely prejudiced in his failure to accept the validity of our arguments. The Minister knows that distinctions are made between the ceiling powers proposed in the consultative paper and those in the Bill. However, school boards could still have potentially wide-ranging powers over staff appointments. The point about the consultative process was that no one wanted school boards to be given those wide-ranging powers over staff appointments. The Minister is wilfully ignoring the views aired in the consultative process.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) has, time and again, publicly stated his opposition to those wide-ranging powers over staff appointments. He should be wary of the Minister's remarks. The Minister is saying that under the Bill school boards can control appointments to their schools. Once those powers have been delegated to school boards, such appointments are not under the review of the local authority.<br><br>
Minimal concessions have been made to the consultative process. At first, people interpreted the Bill differently. They believed that the Minister meant what he said and was climbing down. Far from doing that, he is determined, and has always
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 514</span>
intended, to include wide-ranging powers for school boards in the Bill. Although some members of the Committee cannot see through the Minister, people in the community can.<br><br>
Only this week, I received letters from two school councils in Dundee. The first was from the Ardler/Rockwell school council, and sets out clearly its attitude to the Bill and the consultative process. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"It was unanimously felt that parents were being presented with powers which they had not desired or requested."</p></blockquote>
St. Saviour's school council—a school at which I taught—said that
<br><blockquote><p>"the Bill as laid down would provoke an eventual breakdown of the whole Scottish education system",</p></blockquote>
and that.
<br><blockquote><p>"the vast majority of parents … did not wish to meddle in areas currently dealt with by professional educationalists. The Bill … would leave the way open for a minority of parents to impose their views on curriculum, staffing and many other areas where an unbiased and open viewpoint is vital."</p></blockquote>
The Minister is not dealing with that point. Under the Bill, it is possible for a minority of parents to gain control of a school board and through that control gain control of the school's recurrent budget and staff appointments. No one wanted those powers, but the Minister has ignored the consultative process and allowed those provisions to be included in the Bill.<br><br>
Those who are genuinely anxious about such developments should stand up and be counted. They should argue against the Minister. In the clause, he is trying to con the people who thought that he had listened to them during the consultative process when clearly he had not. It is not good enough for the Minister to argue that if people do not want the powers they need not have them. The majority clearly do not want the powers, and will not ask for the powers through their school boards, but there will always be minorities who wish to control the recurrent budget, staff and appointments in a school, perhaps for religious reasons or because they are in conflict with their local authority. Such minorities will take advantge of the powers and in so doing will discriminate against everyone else in that education area, because in the long run they will affect provision for other schools.<br><br>
I ask all members of the Committee who seriously oppose the prospect of school boards taking over the ceiling powers in something like the detail presented in the consultative process to join the Opposition in opposing the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the clause stand part debate and also to the previous debate on the amendment. The earlier debate was useful for only one purpose to educate the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) about what is in the Bill. It would have helped the Committee if the hon. Gentleman had read the Bill before he spoke to that amendment.<br><br>
I am mystified by the speech of the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion). In an earlier debate, "we considered the powers and concluded that the ceiling powers, to which I object, were not included
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I1034">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 515</span>
in the Bill and would require primary legislation. That was not to the satisfaction of the Opposition, but they are not reasonable in that attitude. If the hon. Gentleman is genuine, he should limit further by specific amendment those powers which can be delegated.</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the right hon. Gentleman not concede that under clause 15 school boards can apply for functions to be delegated to them, including control of the current budget of the school and wide control of staff appointments to the school, which were the only two ceiling powers set out in the consultative paper?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want parental involvement in those matters. That is what this legislation is all about. Listening to the speeches of the hon. Gentleman and other Opposition Members, I am increasingly of the view that they are opposed to the totality of parental involvement. Opposition Members cannot have it both ways. They cannot say that the ceiling powers are still in the Bill and at the same time say, with relish, that the Government have climbed down. Those two points conflict.<br><br>
I agree that there is scope for argument about whether some of the powers in the Bill are correct or incorrect. I accept that debate, but if we are having a structured debate about what ceiling powers are, I am absolutely clear that the Government have moved a long way from those ceiling powers. I say with sincerity, as one who was totally opposed to the ceiling powers, that the tone of some of the speeches from the Opposition Benches has left me with the view that some individual hon. Members do not trust parents. I have confidence in parental involvement and I shall support the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith). It is evident that the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) has moved nearer the Government's view as has seen the wisdom of the provisions in the Bill and that Labour Members have abandoned their public position of being in favour of parental involvement. It seems a far cry from the heyday of Second Reading when an amendment was tabled accusing us of paying only lip service to parental involvement. We have had a considerable amount of lip service from Opposition Members. Their lips have expressed views which seek to reduce the opportunities for parental involvement.<br><br>
Clause 15 is important in that it establishes the principle that any function relating to the running of individual schools should be open for delegation to school level, given the necessary provisions to protect the education authorities' statutory obligations, and so on. Yet again, Opposition Members have argued that the Bill is a prelude to opting out. I shall not go over the arguments that we have had in Committee on that matter, save to remind Opposition Members of the distinction which my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) made between a measure intended to increase parental participation, which is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 516</span>
what the Bill is about, and opting out, which is about extending choice in education.<br><br>
It was argued that the provision to delegate control of the capitation allowance would run counter to the provision to prevent schools boards from determining the form and content of the shcool curriculum. That is an absurd view, given that the average per pupil spent in Scotland is probably about £1,300 and the average capitation is about £30. It was suggested that the provision on delegated powers for a ballot was not appropriate because it relied on a majority of those voting. If that was of such great concern to Opposition Members, why did they not table an amendment to the clause to change that provision? Or was this just an afterthought in view of the need to cobble together some arguments against clause 15?<br><br>
It has been argued that parents would be apathetic. Had we accepted the speeches and injunctions of Opposition Members who have at every opportunity sought to limit the powers and responsibilities of school boards, parents and members of boards would be more likely to be apathetic, because there would be nothing for them to do. The whole attack on clause 15 has been couched in those terms. There is an echo of the arguments which I recall about trade union ballots. I understand that the Opposition have accepted our point, but it was argued that if someone did not go along to meetings and was not involved, he should not have a vote in the election of officials. So this is an interesting turnaround by the Opposition.<br><br>
If there were a very small turn-out in the ballot, my right honourable and learned Friend the Secretary of State would have to take a decision on the basis of what, it could be argued, was an unrepresentative group of parents. In exercising his powers, my right honourable and learned Friend would no doubt take account of the degree of support for delegation in determining whether it was appropriate for him to uphold an appeal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was going to raise this matter later, but it fits in with what the Minister is saying now. On the question of appeals, schedule 3(8) provides that the Secretary of State will be obliged to grant an application for delegated powers
<br><blockquote><p>"after considering the views of the education authority and of the School Board, unless he is satisfied that the delegation requested would prejudice the good running of the school".</p></blockquote>
That is the only issue that the Secretary of State has to take into account. There is nothing about prejudicing the good running of the authority or the impact on the area, and there is nothing about taking into account the fact that only a minority of people voted. The schedule simply states that the Secretary of State must grant such an application unless it prejudices the good running of the school, but that is not what the Minister is saying now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we may explore that when we debate schedule 3. The point is quite clear. My right honourable and learned Friend the Secretary of State might take the view that if, as the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington)
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I1035">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 517</span>
rgued, an unrepresentative minority had secured support in a ballot which was running counter to the wishes of the majority of parents, the ensuing row might prejudice the good running of the school, were the necessary permission for delegated powers to be given in opposition to the view of the education authority. That is consistent with my argument.<br><br>
The other point which was a red herring, made by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion), was about disciplinary powers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not mention disciplinary powers.<br><br>
Mr. Forsyth: If it was the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall), I apologise. Perhaps the two hon. Gentlemen could sort out between themselves who made that point.<br><br>
The question of disciplinary powers over staff remains with the employer and the employer remains the education authority. The Bill makes that clear. A carefully drafted provision gives the necessary requirements for freedom for school boards to take further powers by mutual agreement. Perhaps authorities could experiment with delegation on a trial basis under the provisions of clause 15(3), which permits delegation for a specified period.<br><br>
We have excluded boards from becoming involved in areas shown by consultation to cause concern in order to meet the legislative anxieties expresed. The Oppostition have sought to oppose the clause by arguing about what it does not say instead of what it provides.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the phrase "legitimate anxieties" mean that the Minister accepts that those people were right?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Several positive points were made during the consultative process that we incorporated in the Bill. On that basis, I accepted that criticisms were correct. We embarked on a consultation process to get people to come forward with positive ideas. The Opposition's stance has left me wide-eyed in astonishment. I remeber the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) going on television and announcing that this was a major victory for public opinion and represented a climbdown by the Government. He said that the proposals were very reasonable now, yet in Committee the Opposition seek to unpick that which they described as a victory. That shows that, although they feel the need to pose as being in favour of parental involvement, in reality the only power in which they are interested is in maintaining the power that education authorities have over parents and over schools.<br><br>
I have no hesitation in asking the Committee to support clause 15. It should stand part of the Bill as
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 518</span>
it is an important part of our proposals and provides for boards to grow and develop in the light of the aspirations and expectations of their members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify a point that I raised earlier about staff appointments below the level of assistant head teacher? Local authorities will have surplus staff because school rolls are falling. Can a school board oppose a teacher being transferred by the local education authority?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The provisions in the bill are clear. If boards wish to take delegated powers over the appointments of junior staff, it will be open to them to do so with the agreement of the education authority, which can attach such conditions as it thinks appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I have the final clarification? Does that mean that education authorities have full control over the transfer of staff from one school to another?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It means that whatever powers over the appointments of junior staff are delegated to the school boards will be with the consent of the education authority and with such conditions as it considers appropriate unless those powers have been granted by means of an appeal to the Secretary of State, who can also attach conditions considered to be appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I have that confirmed, because it is important? The school board can have functions delegated to it. If the local authority does not agree, the matter goes to the Secretary of State, who may well decide in favour of the school board as the grounds for not so deciding are limited. That means that the school board has the power to reject transferred staff. A local education authority may have a pool of surplus staff but nowhere to put them because school boards have enough delegated powers to reject them.<br><br>
