</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Schedule 5 provides a range of grounds for eviction, including some which have hitherto been discretionary grounds, where a sheriff had some say in the matter, and also some which the Government have dreamt up. This is the eviction schedule which the Government want to let loose on the people of Scotland. I was slightly amused to read yesterday's press reports of the Secretary of State whistling in the dark and saying that the Government had got their act together in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>674</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that the Opposition had not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He said that the Government had got their act together in Scotland. That should not be all that difficult when there are only 10 members in the cast. The Committee is in the unique position of being able to watch the four chiefs and five Indians in what is in effect the Government of Scotland perform. The Secretary of State was whistling in the dark, and I venture to suggest that he wishes this part of the Bill were being considered in the dark, because the schedule contains a whole new range of mandatory evictions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 360 deals with ground 2 for mandatory eviction, where a sheriff will have no choice but to put a person out of his house. I fear that that will be a growing feature of Scottish housing when the Bill is enacted. People tend to think of evictions as something which happened in the last century—like the highland clearances—but the Bill relies heavily on the insecurity of tenants in order to encourage landlords. That insecurity will mean that evictions will be an increasingly common sight on the streets of Scotland, with all the family tragedy that is involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ground 2 provides for a landlord to claim possession of a property if he wants the house for himself. I realise that that ground exists in current legislation, but the amendment suggests that a landlord should give a prospective tenant fair warning, before he commits himself to going into the house, that that is a possibility. The schedule says that the tenant shall given notice that this trap could be sprung.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Not later than the beginning of the tenancy".</p></blockquote>
The amendments will ensure that the prospective landlord gives tenants fair warning at or before the time of the offer of the tenancy that that possession could take place. One can envisage a tenant being offered the tenancy of a property and committing his family to moving into that house, abandoning other potentially safer accommodation, only to discover later that the landlord might use that device to put him out of his house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not like the way in which the Government are approaching this ground for eviction but believe that there is a case for discretion. We shall go on to debate other aspects of it, but at this stage I stick to the point that a prospective landlord should give a tenant fair warning of the threat at the time when the tenancy is offered, not later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) implied that there were virtually no grounds for eviction in the public sector. Grounds for eviction from council houses exist in great number. There are no less than 16 different grounds, the first seven of which are mandatory. Ground 1 is non-payment of rent; ground 2 is being guilty of criminal conduct; ground 3 is deterioration in the condition of the house; ground 4 is deterioration of furniture; ground 5 is absence from the dwelling
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0450">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>675</span>
house for over six months; ground 6 is transfer of tenancy to the spouse; and ground 7 is causing nuisance in the vicinity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a simple distinction between the private and public sectors. If a public sector landlord—a council—evicts someone from his house, it is obliged to rehouse him under the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977. No such duty accompanies evictions in the private sector. The Minister is creating rights for the private sector without the responsibility that goes with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If somebody becomes homeless, the situation is governed by the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act. We have issued a code of guidance. Our most recent information is that that is operating reasonably satisfactorily. Virtually everyone concerned is found accommodation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By the council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It puts responsibility on the council to rehouse the homeless. The purpose of this part of the Bill is to bring back into use a great deal more private housing for accommodation than exists at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened carefully to the honourable Gentleman's point that notice should be served when or before the tenancy is offered rather than when or before it begins, but I do not accept amendment No. 360. It would be impossible to serve notice formally on a tenant before a tenancy had even been offered. At that stage there would be no tenant on whom to serve the notice, not even a definite prospective tenant. The requirement that notice be served before the tenancy begins is an adequate safeguard for any tenant who may be affected by this ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn briefly to amendments Nos. 337 and 340. I am grateful to the honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) for drawing attention to the gap in ground 3. It has always been the Government's intention that notice under this ground should be served before or at the beginning of the tenancy. Although I cannot accept amendment No. 337 as it stands, I shall bring forward an amendment on this subject at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see no reason to accept amendment No. 340. The form of words both in the Bill and the amendment are well understood and in common use, and I see no point in substituting one for the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I have said demonstrates again my general willingness to consider with a completely open mind all suggestions which are made by Members or others to improve the Bill. We are about to embark on a series of debates on schedule 5, which is an especially important schedule. I do not doubt that we shall examine in detail most of the grounds for repossession contained in the schedule. It may help the Committee, and may lead to a more fruitful debate, if I make clear the Government's general attitude to these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, I am open to all constructive suggestions to improve the schedule so that we can
	<span class='label label-info column'>676</span>
get a correct balance between the rights of the tenant and the rights of the landlord. I emphasise that both have rights and duties. In drafting these grounds for possession, we have sought to recognise that there are good tenants and bad landlords. It would be helpful if the Opposition would reciprocate and abandon their polemical insistence that there are no bad tenants and no good landlords—that is the notion that seems to underlie some, if not many, of the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already shown the Government's readiness to agree to changes where changes can be justified. I have already made the important concession that, if a tenant is to be dispossessed because suitable alternative accommodation is available or he has persistently delayed paying rent, the court should have some discretion rather than none, as was originally provided. I have just promised that ground 3 will be amended to give greater protection to the tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we go through the Bill, honourable Members will find that the same spirit of reasonableness will prevail throughout, in the Government at least, in considering all points. It is therefore a pity that the honourable Member for East Lothian chose to try to make party political capital out of that reasonableness by suggesting that these concessions were extorted out of the Government. In 	<i>The Scotsman</i> yesterday, he was reported as saying that Labour had forced major concessions from the Government in the Committee with regard to the proposed mandatory grounds for eviction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome constructive criticism from wherever it may come and it requires no forcing from the Labour party for the Government to accept it. Many of those changes, and others for which we shall be putting forward Government amendments, would have been made in any case, even if Opposition Members had played no part. A number of persuasive points have, of course, been put to the Government by such organisations as Shelter and others in response to our consultation documents, and we hope to be able to respond positively to many of them, just as we have already.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This, too, shows that those who generated so much synthetic indignation, passion and anger about the fact that the Bill was published before the consultation periods had expired—those who claimed that this showed the consultation to be a sham—were wrong. As we always intended, we have been taking on board points that have been made in response to the consultation papers, both during the passage of the Bill and earlier, and we shall continue to do so. I trust that Opposition Members will have the grace to recognise that we have a very flexible, open-minded and reasonable attitude to their amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and Kinross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a simple answer for the Government. If the Labour party is to distort by imagining that it extorts, let us not give anything to the Labour party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must be careful. My honourable Friends may think that I am too

	<span class='label label-info column'>677</span>
generous, but we shall consider all amendments seriously on their merits. I hope therefore that the honourable Member for East Lothian will not press the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Doran 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister intends to start each day with a press statement, perhaps it should appear on the Amendment Paper so that we can give it its proper place. As he is in such a conciliatory mood, I want to talk about the amendments and in particular his suggestion in response to my honourable Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) that it was impossible to serve notices before the tenancy was offered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am at a loss to understand what the Minister means. The amendments seem straightforward to me. We are conscious of the fact that one of the concessions that the Minister has not made is the imposition of a written lease on landlords, although it is imposed on local authorities. Where there is no written lease I am concerned about vagueness and about protecting the interests of both sides. It strikes me that we have an open door for landords. I do not necessarily suggest that every landlord will want to take the opportunity but, if we assume that a certain amount of formality is attached to the drawing up of the tenancy agreement or a lease, the parties can enter into a contract with quite specific terms that is binding on both parties. Then, before the contract is due to be implemented with an entry date, the landlord can unilaterally change its terms under ground 2, because that simply obliges the landlord to give
	<br><blockquote><p>"notice in writing to the tenant that possession might be recovered"</p></blockquote>
in the circumstances set out. It seems to me quite wrong to recognise and support the legal process of entering into a lease or tenancy agreement and then to allow one side unilaterally to change it. It does not strike me as impossible to serve notice before the tenancy is offered if the parties enter into a contract in the normal way, as they would be required to do by any responsible landlord or agent acting on behalf of a landlord. I am interested to hear what the Minister has to say on those points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ground 2 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Not later than the beginning of the tenancy the landlord gave notice in writing to the tenant".</p></blockquote>
So notice must be given
	<br><blockquote><p>"Not later than the beginning of the tenancy".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister misses the point. A normal tenancy agreement will specify an entry date. It would be impossible for me to enter into an agreement with, for example, the Minister as my landlord whereby I would occupy one of his estate cottages and we would sanctify that in writing by a lease, and then for the Minister thereafter to serve notice on me because I had not yet moved in. There is a gap between the writing of the contract and date of entry and I am concerned about the landlord's powers within that time. There could be an opportunity for the landlord to usurp the terms of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>678</span>
original contract. That position, which is sanctified in schedule 5, is wrong, since the tenant does not have equivalent powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman raised the matter of a written lease. I made it clear earlier that I would consider that matter and return to it in due course. I do not give any guarantee but the Government are considering this aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Gentleman mentioned estate cottages. I do not have any estate cottages so that fiction could not materialise. In any case, we think that it is unreasonable to expect that notice should be given before a tenancy is even offered. Clearly, a person who is only a potential tenant would resent it if he received notice, so that would be inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is not always a gap between the date of entry and the signing of the lease. We believe that service of notice before the beginning of the tenancy is the right way to provide protection for tenants. For that reason I do not accept the amendments and I see no reason for amendment No. 340. As I have said, I shall bring forward an amendment at a later stage to deal with the point raised in amendment No. 337.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that many Opposition Members are impressed by the synthetic reasonableness of the Minister's remarks. He might have been more convincing if he had put his message across with a straight face, but I have the impression that even the honourable Gentleman did not believe it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is now claiming credit for the fact that the Government are abandoning significant aspects of the schedule as originally drafted. I wonder why it was drafted in that way in the first place. Presumably, the Government intended the provisions to be mandatory grounds for eviction, so as to encourage landlords. I am not surprised that the honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) says that he would prefer those mandatory grounds for eviction to stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government case is falling apart. They embarked on the consultation process after the legislation was drafted, so they should not be surprised that people are picking holes in it. As for whether the Government have made concessions to the Opposition or to anyone else, whether the Minister likes it or not, we moved the amendments to the preceding clause on Thursday night last, and it was he who conceded the point to us, so the Minister cannot be unduly surprised about the point that we have made. If the honourable Gentleman already recognised that it was bad law to give landlords the right to evict people, he should not have had the provision in the Bill, and he should not be surprised when we attack him for those diabolical suggestions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is demonstrating that he is not prepared to be reasonable. He is cheerfully acknowledging that it will be all right for a private landlord to lead a prospective tenant up the garden path, to lead him into a trap by saying: "I'll rent you
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0452">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>679</span>
that nice house there, and you can move in and decorate it." However, after the agreement has been made, but before the tenant moves into the house, the landlord can say that he has the right to put the tenant out at any time that he might need the house because he has lived in it himself, perhaps 40 years before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That demonstrates that the Minister has no intention of being reasonable. He is determined to give such landlords unjustifiable means of evicting families from their homes. That is why we fear for the future of many Scottish tenants who find themselves lured into the private sector as a result of the Bill. We share the Minister's hope that there will be good private landlords who will act properly, but there must be considerable alarm that the Government are creating so much scope for abuse. There is no doubt that it will occur.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The main purpose of amendment No. 239 is to take account of the fact that the Bill reduces even further the right of tenants in Scotland. It seeks to impose a time limit within which the landlord must have occupied the premises. The Bill will make it possible for a landlord to implement ground 2(a) on the basis that he has been in the house at any time during his lifetime. His only presence there may have been, for example, when he was born, some 50 or 60 years earlier. By imposing a time limit, we seek to restrict the landlord's rights. We have chosen what we believe to be a reasonable time limit of five years. Therefore, if a landlord has occupied the premises at any time within the previous five years, he will be entitled to use ground 2(a). We believe that that is reasonable and consistent.

On amendment No. 321, at present the landlord has the opportunity to require a rented dwelling house to be vacated if it is reasonably required, by himself or certain specified members of his family. Case 8 in part I of schedule 2 to the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 provides:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where the dwelling-house is reasonably required by the landlord for occupation as a residence for—
	<ol>
	<li>himself, or</li>
	<li>any son or daughter of his over 18 years of age, or</li>
	<li>his father or mother, or</li>
	<li>if the dwelling house is let on or subject to a regulated tenancy, the father or mother of his wife or husband".</li></ol></p></blockquote>
Those are specified classifications. Ground 2(b) (i) of the Bill requires the tenant to move from the premises or allows him to be evicted if the landlord
	<br><blockquote><p>"requires the house as his or her spouse's only or principal home".</p></blockquote>
We seek to remove the word "principal" because, if the landlord has more than one home, surely it is not appropriate for him to use the power in the schedule to remove the tenant. This is a completely new power, which gives far more flexibility than the reasonable needs of both landlord and tenant require. It extends the law and a landlord's power unreasonably and far beyond the investment purposes behind the schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first issue raised by the honourable Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) related to the time limit. I cannot see any sense in the amendment, which requires the landlord to have lived in the house within five years of the beginning of the tenancy. That is an unnecessary restriction. If the person concerned decided to work abroad for six years and let his house, that would severely interfere with his right of repossession. It is important that a man who has worked abroad should not be disentitled from regaining perhaps his only home. The unfortunate man would be unable to regain possession of his house because he was not in residence within five years of the beginning of the tenancy. I fear that that restriction is calculated simply to reduce the supply of private rented accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Gentleman referred to case 8, where the house is required by the landlord or family under the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984. There are even more grounds for repossession under that Act than there are under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can deal fairly quickly with amendments Nos. 321 and 322, which are also restricting. They seek to replace the test of only or principal home with a requirement that the house concerned should have been or should be intended as the landlord's only home. That is an unjust and arbitrary restriction. The kind of person who lets his house with a view to returning to it later is precisely the kind of person who is likely to have more than one home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To take my example again of the man who works abroad, for a year or two before he decides to let his house in this country he may have been living abroad at his place of work. Another example would be a person who buys a remote house in the country, intending to live there for most of the year but to retain a small flat in town for the winter months which might be his retirement home. He would find
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0453">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>681</span>
to his astonishment that he could not get the use of his retirement home. He would find to his astonishment that he could not get the use of his retirement home in town when the time came, because he had been unwise enough to retain somewhere else to live for a small part of the year. Therefore, the balance of advantage rests in the ground as drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to take up two points from what the Minister has said. First, he presented the hypothesis of the gentleman who had worked abroad for six years. I should have thought that he would be entitled to recover possession under ground 2(b) and I fail to see why the Minister uses that example. As I understand it, that person has the right to repossess his home under the existing provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Minister seems to be presenting hypotheses which are not the norm but are extremes. It is never good to legislate for extremes. We are talking about improving the rented market in Scotland. A landlords' charter which reduces and minimises any rights which tenants may have will have the opposite effect and will put the private rented market in chaos.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman's first point that repossession is covered by ground 2(b) is not correct in the case of a new tenancy while the landlord is abroad. It is necessary to have grounds in the Bill, although not so many as under former legislation, to ensure that more private houses come back into the private rented market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to take this to extremes, but I do not understand what the Minister said. This would not apply in the case of a new tenancy that was created while the owner was abroad. Presumably while he is abroad he is still in a position either to instruct agents or do it himself by giving the notice required under 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have nothing to add to what I have already said, that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the landlord who is seeking possession or, in the case of joint landlords seeking possession, at least one of them—
	<ol>
	<li>requires the house as his or his spouse's only or principal home; and</li>
	<li>(ii) did not acquire the landlord's interest in the tenancy for money or money's worth."</li></ol></p></blockquote>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government seem to be legislating in order to protect the rights of people with property in Scotland who are working abroad.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I do not wish to press too hard, because it is clear that we shall not receive much by way of an answer.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman asks about the purpose behind the grounds.

We believe that a considerable number of people want to be tenants in this sector and that there is a case for bringing back into operation many of the vacant houses—and if the grounds, which already exist under previous legislation, as the honourable Gentleman has admitted, are restricted too much under the Bill, there will not be that highly desirable revival of the private rented sector.</p>

As was made clear on the previous amendments, ground 2 is that the landlord may apply for repossession where the house was at some time prior to the commencement of the tenancy his only or principal home, or where the house was required as his spouse's only or principal home and the property was not acquired by the landlord for "money or money's worth".

I strongly support ground 2, on the reasoning put forward by my honourable Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker). This is a technical amendment.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood), whose name is also associated with the amendment, is feeling rather poorly. I do not know whether that is because of his recent exposure to the Social Democratic party. We wish him a rapid recovery from what is ailing him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment deals with ground 3, which I would describe in shorthand as the ground that publishes a right for a creditor to evict his debtor's tenant. That is a fair way to describe what the Government propose. The amendment would replace ground 3 at a later stage in the schedule in order to ensure that possession is granted on that ground only when the court considers it reasonable. It is one of the mandatory grounds for possession, as it stands; we suggest that it should be discretionary. I understood from something that the Under-Secretary of State said last Thursday night that the Government were reconsidering whether this ground was appropriate and should remain as a mandatory ground for eviction. As I said, we feel that the Government's case is falling apart in relation to this schedule. We welcome that, and hope that it will crumble a bit further this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that unscrupulous landlords are not provided with a mechanism for securing vacant possession merely to realise the value of the property. One can visualise many circumstances in which it would be easy for them to do so. Indeed, this is one aspect of the Bill that we are worried about. It will encourage a type of landlordism in Scotland where this sort of mechanism could be easy to operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been put to us by Shelter that in its experience landlord companies are often subsidiaries of larger companies, from whom they obtain the necessary mortgages to buy property for rent. As the Bill stands, a larger company wishing to realise the profit on any given property provides that company with a mechanism for obtaining vacant possession. The smaller landlord company need only default on the loan from the sister company for the larger company to be entitled to dispose of the property with vacant possession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether the Minister likes it or not, it will be very easy for many of the sort of landlord companies that the Minister wants to encourage to do just that, and that would not be reasonable. It would be far too easy for landlord companies taking advantage of the ground to undermine tenants' security and to evict people simply to realise a profit on the vacant possession. There is clearly a case for altering these circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0455">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>685</span>
I understand that in 1957, when the private rented sector was deregulated in England and Wales and security of tenure for tenants was reduced, there was a sharp drop in the amount of rented housing available, as landlords were more able to realise the value of their properties with vacant possesion. The Bill has the potential for allowing a similar situation to arise in Scotland, which would result in a decrease in the private stock available for rent and an increase in homelessness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We understand that through the Bill the Government are seeking to increase the private stock available to rent, but the fear that is expressed in the amendment is that although in the short term it might encourage some people to get involved in renting property in the private sector it would be far too easy for a wide range of commercial operations to indulge in financial shenanigans with subordinate and sister companies in order to achieve mandatory eviction of their tenants on this ground, so that they could sell off the property and make a quick profit. The Minister said last Thursday that he was prepared to consider altering the status of this ground for eviction. I invite him to say a little more about that now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This ground for eviction offends me for two reasons. First, it shows that the Government place the rights of investors and security holders above the rights of tenants. Secondly, it offends me, as a Scots lawyer. There is a long-established tradition in Scotland, based on the Leases Act 1491, which protects the tenant where there is a transfer of the landlord's interest in the property. I had intended to read from that Act, but I think I would struggle a bit. But it is worth putting it on the record that the Leases Act 1491 protected the tenant in any case where there was a transfer of property, regardless of whether there was a standard security arrangement. In any transfer of the landlord's interest, the tenant held his interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The 1491 Act was presumably enacted by a Scottish Parliament. Would it not be outrageous if this English-dominated Parliament were to try to repeal that protection?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. We have already stressed that this schedule is based almost totally on the English Housing Bill. The 1491 Act was made by the old Scottish Parliament. Most of the Acts that related to the ordinary people of Scotland were made
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the safetie and favore of the puir fowkes that labores the gruhnd."</p></blockquote>
This schedule will not do many favours for the "puir fowkes that labores the gruhnd".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1491 Act would have protected a tenant in that situation, but its effect has been removed by ground 3. As my honourable Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) pointed out, this ground opens the door to any unscrupulous landlords who choose, as many do now, to form themselves into companies. In my legal practice I have experience of landlords who did just that. They formed a multiplicity of companies, making it very
	<span class='label label-info column'>686</span>
difficult to trace the ownership of a property and, even more, who was letting it. The schedule opens up the possibility that landlords—not by creating a fictitious security, because a heritable security will have to be recorded, but simply by creating securities over ground without any specification of value and transferring between companies—could have a tenant evicted on that ground alone. It is a mandatory provision, so the court has no option so long as the creation of the security falls within those terms. There is the prospect that whole tenements or streets of tenements could be subject to a security, so a large number of tenants of an unscrupulous landlord could be put at risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am keen to see the ground removed altogether rather than to see its status changed. It is a serious imposition on a well-founded tradition in Scots law and I hope that the Minister will look at it again. There are serious issues here. The way in which we treat these old Acts is a serious matter for tenants. The legislation was created for good and honourable purposes and it offered real protection. The atmosphere with regard to private leasing in 1491 was far more in favour of the landlord than it is now and I can see no reason for the Government to remove the protection given by the old Scots Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think we need to go as far back as 1491 to find suitable grounds for Scottish leases. A similar ground existed in case 11 of schedule 2 to the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984. So this is not a new mandatory ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the point made by the honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson), I agreed to amend that ground on notice and that will be done. As the honourable Gentleman said, the purpose was to increase the private rented stock available for rent. That is one of the Government's major objectives in the Bill. One way in which this will be done in practice will be for lending institutions to advance capital to landlords and prospective landlords to enable the latter to purchase houses for letting. If the amendment were made, the lender would be left with no security for his loan. The result would inevitably be that lending institutions would simply refuse to lend on houses to be let, or refuse consent for the letting of a house already subject to a heritable security. The only effect of a measure of that nature would be to reduce the supply of houses to let. I recognise that the Opposition might be prepared to take that risk, but the Government take a different view. We want to expand the private rented sector and increase the supply of houses to let. For that reason, we reject the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal briefly with the matter of the provision of "suitable alternative accommodation" in amendment No. 438. The proposal is well intentioned, but again it is impractical. A landlord who has defaulted on mortgage payments is highly unlikely to have any other property in which to offer accommodation or to have enough funds to pay compensation. In many cases of repossession for mortgage default, the debtor will be difficult if not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0456">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>687</span>
impossible to trace, so I do not think that it would be right to give false hopes to tenants by including in the Bill a provision that might prove to be unworkable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully understand the Minister's concern about the genuine landlord who has borrowed money from a bank and needs some security against the loan. I understand the intention of ground 3 as it stands, but the Minister fails to appreciate that there are other people who are not genuine landlords. Because ground 3 is mandatory, he is making available to those people a mechanism whereby they can exploit the terms of the Bill to turn tenants out without just cause. I appeal to the Minister to try to understand those circumstances. The ground is a mandatory ground for possession by a landlord, so it will be possible for unscrupulous people to set up a mechanism whereby a landlord company—which is a legal fiction and is a sister company of a bigger company which makes the money available to that landlord company—lets a property to a tenant and then, as and when it sees fit, pretend to default on the mortgage and throw the tenant out. It is to prevent that type of development that we want to remove that ground from the mandatory grounds and make it discretionary. The sheriff court can then protect the genuine landlord and at the same time deal with the unscrupulous landlord. It is a reasonable admendment and I ask the Minister to think again and give way on this. Otherwise, the way will be left open for unscrupulous people to set up fictitious landlord companies which are really sister companies of a bigger company and then fiddle about by pretending to default on mortgages in order to get tenants out without just cause. The Minister must do something about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the honourable Gentleman is suggesting in relation to a company that may transfer some of its obligations to a sister company so that the original position may change. Ground 3 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The house is subject ot a heritable security granted before the creation of the tenancy".</p></blockquote>
The security must to exist before the tenancy is granted, so that point does not apply. Of course, prospective tenants would be well advised to look with extreme care before entering into a lease at what was being offered and whether any heritable securities were in existence. I am ready to consider any suggestion that would not have the effect of drying up the supply of houses in the private rented sector. Certainly, as I have already said ground 3 will be amended to allow notice to be given. The basic point to which we come back is that if lenders are denied security they simply will not lend, and if they do not lend, the house will unavailable for letting. That leads to a decline in the private rented sector, which is directly in conflict with our objectives. For that reason, I cannot accept the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make two points. First, the Minister has just said that tenants should look with care to see whether there are any securities in
	<span class='label label-info column'>688</span>
existence. Is he aware of the process that must be gone through before a tenant can check whether there are securities in existence? Does he expect that the average tenant will be in a position to instruct searches in the register and to check the true position of a title? That smacks of a total lack of understanding of the private rented sector as it operates in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, this is a gross incursion into the rights of tenants because the difference between the way in which the ground is worded and the terms of case 11(c)(vi) in schedule 2 to the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 opens a barn door to landlords. They simply have to create a security and have it recorded over a property. Thereafter, any tenant who moves into the property, regardless of the terms of the standard security so long as it is in statutory form, will be liable to be evicted at any time when a calling-up notice is given. That is how I understand that it would operate. Those things are easy to organise between companies and a troublesome tenant could be removed. There is no sanction, no check, and no protection for the tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that the Minister intends to look at the basis on which this ground shall apply, whether it should be mandatory or discretionary. [Honorary Members "He has not said that yet."] In that case, I urge the Minister to look at that aspect. There should be some consideration for a tenant in that position and some power for the court to find out whether the security is genuine or has been created purely for tactical reasons, to be brought into affect whenever a landlord has no other means of evicting a tenant. That should be examined carefully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to respond to the honourable Gentleman. We are discussing the terms of that amendment that I shall put forward on Report, which will ensure that the tenant will not have to make a search because he will be informed by the landlord. Our amendment will ensure that ground 3 will be established only if the landlord gives notice at or before the beginning of the tenancy that it might be invoked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These matters are of great importance. Like the honourable Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran), I have worked in a law office. One of my jobs was to go through all the old title deeds to make sure that, if there were any heritable securities, they were made known to a prospective purchaser. Therefore, that amendment will be forthcoming.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The speeches that the Minister has just made illustrate how recently some of these changes in Government policy have taken place. He has just told my honourable Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) that the Government intend to table an amendment requiring landlords to give notice to prospective tenants that this catch will exist, when a minute or so earlier he was reading a statement, presumably attached to the same brief, which said that prospective tenants would be well advised to make inquiries to find out whether securities existed over the property. So the Under-Secretary of State is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0457">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>689</span>
clearly legislating on the hoof here, so there are grounds for anxiety.

If this part of the schedule is to remain on the face of the Bill, there should be a requirement on prospective landlords to give tenants notice that this risk exists. It would be monstrous to entice a prospective tenant and his family into a property without telling them that they could face this degree of insecurity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the honourable Gentleman accept that that requirement will be included in the amendment that we shall bring forward on Report?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was quite a good recovery by the Minister from his state of confusion. I welcome the fact that there is to be a minor amendment. We should be grateful for small mercies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One aspect of the schedule occurs to me which neither my honourable Friend for Aberdeen, South nor I referred to earlier. We are not necessarily dealing with companies and corporate arrangements. I presume that it will be open to any individual landlord to go to his bank and arrange for the whole of his overdraft to be secured over a certain property and then have the tenant evicted and sell the property to clear an overdraft incurred through other business activities. That power could easily be abused if we do not succeed in making the provision discretionary rather than mandatory, and certainly if there is no significant amendment is tabled in relation to notice being given before this trap can be sprung.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course we want to encourage the provision of let property in Scotland, but with secure tenancies and fair rents. We are not prepared to sacrifice security and standards for thousands of tenants in Scotland, which is evidently what the Government intend. We must be alarmed at the prospect of insecurity and high rents which the Government are unleashing in the land. The more we listen to the debates about the grounds for eviction, the more it seems that this type of tenancy should carry a Government health warning, because there will not be much joy for tenants who land in a trap like this. We fear that this arrangement will be glorified loan sharks' charter in private sector rented housing, and we do not like it. I urge my honourable Friends and, indeed, the whole Committee to support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Amendment made:</i> No. 183, in page 55, line 30, leave out 'court' and insert 'sheriff.—	<i>[Lord James Douglas-Hamilton.]</i></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 325, in page 55, line 32, leave out from beginning to end of line 8, on page 56.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to delete ground 4, under which, if a let is for a specified period not exceeding eight months and the property has been let as a holiday let in the previous 12 months, the let may be terminated at the option and discretion of the landlord. If the landlords were drawing up a charter for themselves, they would include this ground for repossession among their rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the schedule stands, a landlord could simply make sure that he let his properties for less time than the requisite eight months, then write to each tenant at the start of the let saying that he might want to repossess the property. Having done that, he would have carte blanche to evict perfectly responsible tenants whenever it suited him to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The qualification that the property must also have been let as a holiday let in the previous 12 months does not detract from the landlord's rights. As the Minister knows, many parts of Scotland, as well as being major centres of population, are also major tourist attractions. I do not know whether that can be said of Glasgow, the city of culture, but it can certainly be said of Dundee, the city of discovery, and many thousands of people come to Dundee every year. Landlords could let their properties as holiday lets between, say, the end of May and the beginning of September every year and then, when the holiday-makers go away, let them as homes for the homeless each year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister would probably argue that the Government are encouraging such people to bring their houses back into the property market, thus helping to house the homeless, but he is really saying that the homeless can be housed between September and May every year, but will be homeless again between May and September. The homeless will become unwilling travelling people, never allowed to stay in a permanent residence. That is not the kind of option for which any member of the Committee should argue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux hit the nail on the head when it said that the clauses and schedules in part II of the Bill
	<br><blockquote><p>"will not help to achieve the Government's stated aim of revitalising the private rented sector."</p></blockquote>
The association
	<br><blockquote><p>"supports the right of every person to a home which is safe, secure and affordable."</p></blockquote>
Those tenants given a home under the conditions dealt with by ground 4 would certainly not have a secure home. The association went on to say that under part II
	<br><blockquote><p>"The balance of interests between landlord and tenant will be shifted significantly in favour of landlords."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0458">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>691</span>
Ground 4 sums that up. The Bill's provisions may bring more private housing back into the market, but it will be on terms which suit only the landlords and not the tenants who may rent the properties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no solution to the problem of the homeless to give them a home in the winter and make them homeless every summer, yet that is what would happen under ground 4. I ask the Minister to remove it from the mandatory grounds on which people can be evicted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with everything that my honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) has said. I have a constituency interest in the problem, with which the Minister may be familiar, as he is resident in the tourist area of my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every spring since I have been a Member, constituents who were about to be evicted from holiday accommodation in which they they had had shelter during the winter months have come to see me. A balance needs to be struck between the promotion of tourism in Scotland and the provision of housing for individuals and families. Inevitably, there is a conflict. I find it distressing when individuals or families who have rented a cottage, a caravan or other tourist accommodation on the coast of east Lothian, and have done a landlord a favour because they have looked after the property, heated it and kept it dry during the winter months, are made homeless as soon as there is the prospect of golfers or holiday makers coming to the area and paying much higher rent during the holiday season. With a bit of luck, the local authority may be able to do something for such folk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the problem. I would be the last person to say anything hostile or detrimental to the tourist industry, as I recognise its importance. What is the Government's thinking about the balance that has to be struck?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The matter greatly affects my constituency, which has a large tourist area, and where the tourist industry is the largest single employer. It does much more for the well being of, and wealth creation in, my constituency than any other industry. I advise my honourable Friends on the Front Bench to tread carefully, because there is no question that people occupy country cottages in the winter months knowing full well that they are being given only a short lease. Many of them come from the neighbouring cities and towns and are not natives of that part of the country. They take the lease on the understanding that they cannot stay for long. It is important to tread carefully. It is vital to keep the tourist accommodation for the purpose for which it is intended—for use in the tourist season.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Increasingly, the winter season is becoming as economically viable and profitable for the tourist industry as the summer season, with the growing importance of skiing and other winter activities. That is another matter that my honourable Friends on the Front Bench must bear in mind. I should be reluctant
	<span class='label label-info column'>692</span>
to see anything go on to the statute book that would inhibit the letting of accommodation for tourist-related activities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to respond to the points raised. The ground will assist constituents of my honourable Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) in promoting tourism in Scotland, which is very important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) asked where the balance should be drawn. This ground relates to short term accommodation for specified periods not exceeding eight months. To the honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) I say that I do not see lets for such short periods as an overall solution to the problems of Scotland's homeless. They might be for a short time, but this provision relates to tourist opportunities in Scotland and to ensuring that the houses concerned are in use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Dundee, East is under a misapprehension if he believes that removing ground 4 will improve the lot of tenants. It would not. Ground 4 allows people to let holiday homes for longer periods in the off season and still be sure of getting their back property for letting when the holiday season starts again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my honourable Friend the Member for Tayside, North will realise, letting for holidays will almost certainly be more lucrative than long-term letting—so much so that if ground 4 were not in the Bill, this useful source of accommodation might dry up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Dundee, East acknowledged that the ground might lead to more houses coming on to the market. The solution to the problem of the homeless involves a much wider spread of factors, and this provision will not be of assistance, although the Bill will bring many houses back on to the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened to the worries of Opposition Members about abuses of ground 4. There has been no evidence of widespread abuse under the indentical provision in the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984. Therefore, I see no reason to fear its emergence now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is a probing amendment which is connected with the debate on holiday letting, and deals with letting to students.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is desirable that universities and colleges have an additional source of income by letting out some of their halls of residence in the summer. The purpose of ground 5 is to allow universities, colleges and other bodies to let such accommodation in their ownership when it is not required for students and yet be sure of regaining possession when it is needed for students once more. The honourable Member will be aware that numerous conferences take place in the summer at the Pollock halls of resident at Edinburgh university.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that the provision will be available to educational institutions, rather than to private landlords who might let property to students?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To the best of my knowledge, that is certainly the case. I had not envisaged any other circumstances. The practice of temporary letting of vacant student accommodation is a common one and is a useful source of extra revenue. I can conceive of no possible objection to giving institutions the grounds for ensuring that they can get the accommodation back for the students when it is needed, to avoid the possibility of assured tenants occupying rooms in the middle of their student hostels.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>"Ground 18</i></p>
	<p>The following conditions are fulfilled—
	<ol>
	<li>the tenant has given a notice to quit which has expired and, in consequence of that notice, the landlord has contracted to sell or let the dwelling-house or has taken any other steps as the result of which he would, in the opinion of the court, be seriously prejudiced if he could not obtain possession;</li>
	<li>the tenant has remained in possession of the whole or any part of the house; and</li>
	<li>proceedings for the recovery of the possession have begun not more than three months after the expiry of the notice to quit; and</li>
	<li>the tenant is not entitled to possession of the house by virtue of a new tenancy.".</li></ol></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ground 7 as it stands is a significant departure from the grounds set out in the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984. When the tenant company gives notice to quit it is not irrevocable provided that the landlord suffers no financial loss, such as having contracted to re-let or sell the property. That is accepted by all parties as reasonable. It was accepted as reasonable in 1984 but it is not accepted by the Government as reasonable in 1988.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of problems can arise from this. Tenants will, I believe, give the minimum necessary notice to quit. They will not want to risk giving a long notice to quit, because their circumstances might then change and they would be faced with the threat of being thrown out on the street. I notice that the Minister nods in agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will restrict the mobility of the work force. Tenants who are seeking employment in another part of the country may be reluctant to give notice; they may indeed be reluctant to look for work elsewhere, in the knowledge that if something goes wrong—for example, if they accept a job and it falls through—and they have given notice to quit, the landlord can evict them without question, even though he may not have contracted to let or sell the house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I submit that it will also increase the abandonment of tenancies, so that people who have found work elsewhere or found alternative accommodation will, instead of giving notice to quit abandon the tenancy
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0460">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>695</span>
and clear off, because of their fear that the arrangements that they have made may fall through. That would do neither party any good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the proposal would penalise a number of groups. It would penalise the senior citizen who, old and infirm, plans to join his family or in-laws, when the arrangements fall through for some reason. The daughter-in-law or son-in-law may have a heart attack; the family may no longer be able to take him or her because of the sort of fall-out that occurs in all normal families. Yet the elderly person, having given notice to quit and having seen the arrangements fall through, can then be almost summarily evicted by the landlord, whereas at present the landlord must show that he has been financially or contractually disadvantaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The aspiring home owner who is bidding for house after house and who eventually secures a house and gives notice to quit, may then get a bad survey, which means that a building society will not lend on the house. That person and all his family can be thrown out on to the street if ground 7 goes through unamended. In the final category is the Minister's favourite person, the worker in Saudi Arabia. He goes off to seek work there on a speculative basis; he has the qualifications and is offered a flight out there to be interviewed for a job. He gives notice to quit, but the job offer then falls through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are so many possibilities, none of them too far-fetched, that I suspect that all the arguments were brought to bear in favour of the Rent Act 1984—arguments that were considered to be reasonable then. The Minister's civil servants could no doubt multiply them and think of better examples, as they probably did when drafting and implementing that measure. It is hard to see why the Minister should not drop ground 7 and substitute an additional ground 18, as we have done in amendment No. 403, which merely writes into the Bill what is in the existing Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that that will be a significant deterrent on tenants from serving reasonable notice to quit. Some will not serve notice to quit at all; others will not seek to become home-owners, or go for jobs, if that puts their tenancy at risk. They will not seek to move in with in-laws if they are growing old and infirm. Ground 7 will not foster the good relations that I am sure was the original purpose of the 1984 Act. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the mandatory grounds of the 1984 Act was tenants' notice to quit. In that respect, this is no different. The honourable Gentleman put forward to the Committee the range of possibilities that can arise in such circumstances, and I listened to him carefully. I still think that as a general principle it is right that a landlord should be able to recover possession of his property if the tenant has given notice of an intention to give up the tenancy—we all have the right to expect that promises will be fulfilled—but I accept the honourable Gentleman's point that there may be
	<span class='label label-info column'>696</span>
some cases in which a tenant intends to leave and then discovers that his personal circumstances have changed. In such cases I would expect a landlord to be sympathetic to the needs of the tenant and seek to make use of this ground only if he had a pressing need to repossess the house. I am convinced, therefore, that the honourable Gentleman's fears are largely unfounded. Even so, I undertake to consider the whole issue of whether the ground should be mandatory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>The landlord who is seeking possession intends to demolish or reconstruct the whole or a substantial part of the house or to carry out substantial works on the house or any part thereof or any building of which it forms a part and the following conditions are fulfilled—
	<ol>
	<li>the landlord, or in the case of joint landlords, at least one of them, did not acquire the landlord's interest in the tenancy for money or money's worth; and</li></ol></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment deals with ground 8, which gives the landlord the right to gain possession if he wants to demolish or redevelop the property. Will the Minister explain how the ground has operated in the past, and how he anticipates that it will work in the future? Where will a tenant be able to go under those circumstances? It would be open to any landlord letting houses or flats in his property suddenly to decide that it would be more lucrative to demolish the whole lot and turn it into a parking lot or an amusement arcade, or some other kind of non-housing development. As I read this ground, he would be perfectly entitled to issue notice to the tenants; and the sheriff would have no option but to put the unfortunate people out of their homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One wonders whether the sheriff should not at least be allowed to take account of whether the local authority had granted planning consent for the change of use of the property. As it stands, it does not matter how spurious the landlord's reason might be for wanting to demolish or redevelop the property; he could simply go to the sheriff and say, "I have all
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0461">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>697</span>
these tenants and I want to get them out of the property. It is my intention to demolish the property in order to do something else with it. Will you please give me carte blanche to fling them all out of their houses?" Regardless of how spurious the ground might be, and even whether the landlord ever gets round to carrying out the demolition or redevelopment of the property, the sheriff would have absolutely no choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sheriff should be able to take into account whether the landlord has planning permission from the local authority to do whatever he says he intends to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman asked what the circumstances where in the past. In the 1984 Act deterioriation of the conditions of the house was ground 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said many times already, one of the aims of the Bill is to increase the quality of housing let for private rent. Ground 8 is one of the tools to achieve that, because we must encourage landlords to improve their property, but if that aim is to be achieved, we must not erect unnecessary obstacles in the way. If a landlord honestly intends to redevelop his property, he should be able to gain possession, if he need to, to carry out the required work. The landlord will have to have a firm and provable intention to develop before ground 8 can be invoked. It will not be enough for him simply to say that he has a vague intention of doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One point that is often overlooked, and that seems to me to emphasise the need for this ground to remain mandatory, is that not to have such a ground would work to inhibit good landlords. Good landlords may wish to improve their property for the benefit of tenants but may not be able to obtain adequate access to carry out such improvements. Such landlords will most often be housing associations, but they may also be small landlords with a limited number of properties. Making ground 8 mandatory ensures that improvements can and will take place. I hope that the honourable Gentleman will seek to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not find that particularly reassuring, but I accept that it might be right to encourage responsible landlords to renovate and look after their property properly. But this ground goes to far and allows perhaps even spurious grounds to be conjured up. The landlord could tell the sheriff that it was his intention to demolish the property in order to do something totally different, which had nothing to do with landlordism but was simply to increase its value. I am not reassured, and I do not intend to seek to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to come back on that point if the honourable Gentleman wishes me to.

As the ground is drafted, the landlord would be entitled to take action on the death of a tenant against anyone who otherwise would be entitled to succeed to the tenancy. We must remember that this is a mandatory ground; the sheriff has no discretion in the matter.

	<span class='label label-info column'>699</span>
It has long been held in Scotland that the spouse had the right of succession. In the existing legislation that succession can proceed further down the line. By inserting words in the amendment we seek to protect the spouse. I could cite many examples to justify this. We are talking about a house which may have been the family home for many decades. I visited a constituent yesterday who had stayed in the same home for 58 years. If that person were widowed, it would be outrageous and monstrous to suggest that the landlord should have the opportunity to remove that individual simply on the basis of the death of the tenant. There is a reluctance among landlords to consider joint tenancies. In these circumstances, the spouse would be out on the street and would then look to the local authority. There is a declining rental market, and it is important to protect spouses. I therefore commend amendment No. 341.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 397 seeks to provide some time limits on the operation of this ground. As it stands, the ground provides that proceedings for the recovery of possession may be begun
	<br><blockquote><p>"not later than twelve months after the death of the former tenant".</p></blockquote>
That would be fine, but then the landlord has a discretion, subject to consideration by the court:
	<br><blockquote><p>"if the sheriff so directs, after the date on which, in his opinion, the landlord became aware of the former tenant's death."</p></blockquote>
It is difficult to see why landlord needs that protection. He is given a whole year in which to consider his position. Presumably, a good landlord will have contact with the tenant and will know what is going on in the household either directly or through an agent; yet he is given the opportunity to argue before the sheriff that he should have an extension if he is not sharp enough to take his application before the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that, apart from watering down the rights of tenants, this opens up a huge potential for litigation. How many tenants in bereavement would be capable of sending a formal letter to their landlord saying, "My husband—or "my wife"—has died and I now wish to succeed to the tenancy"? How many people in bereavement would be capable of that, or even consider it necessary? It strikes me as an imposition and an over-protective attitude towards landlords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Minister to consider carefully what he is doing here. There is virtually no time limit in a case like this. There is no real parameter. If we are to give landlords carte blanche, let us say that. Let us scrap the whole schedule and say that landlords can get rid of tenants whenever they like, because that is effectively what it says. We are opening the doors to endless litigation, and tenants are being put on the defensive all the time. It is not a question of whether a tenant is a good or a bad tenant—an unfortunate occurrence can bring this ground into action. We are simply seeking to protect the victims of that unfortunate occurrence. Therefore, I ask the Minister to consider the amendments sympathetically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>700</span>
presented his case for the amendments well but, despite what he has said, the Government believe that one of the problems about revitalising the private rented sector is that if succession is allowed, a landlord may be unable to regain possession of his house, sometimes for several generations. We believe that a statutory right to succession has been one factor in the decline of the private rented sector. If we wish to encourage growth, we must deal with the barriers that exist.

The honourable Gentleman expressed particular concern about the position of widowed spouses. That is the issue raised by amendments Nos. 341 and 342. He believes that landlords may try to make use of this ground. That is unlikely, but it is open to tenants who are married, or any other family group, to make a joint tenancy, so if one tenant dies, the other will continue to be entitled to the tenancy. Without giving any guarantee or commitment, I shall look at this point again, as I shall look at all other reasonable proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In terms of investment and bringing houses back on to the rented market, I fail to see how landlords are prejudiced.

If there are other grounds for removing that individual, the landlord has ample opportunity to do so.

I urge the Minister to look sympathetically at the position of spouses. The White Paper does not say anywhere that the Government intend to throw widows and widowers out on the streets, but that is effectively what the Minister is doing by leaving the decision to landlords.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments deal with grounds 10 and 11 which relate to tenants who fall into rent arrears. We have already said that we are alarmed that it will be so easy for landlords to evict tenants for many reasons. We are especially concerned about the loose way in which the grounds are drafted at present and the fact that they are to be mandatory as the Bill stands. The Minister has said that he is minded to make certain concessions in view of the panic reaction that has been seen in the Committee, and we look forward to hearing more about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to address various aspects of grounds 10 and 11 as drafted and the way that the amendments would improve the position for the tenant without necessarily making undue difficulties for the landlord. Amendments No. 244 and 245 are intended to ensure that the sheriff court has discretion to consider the reasonableness of granting a possession order and to ensure that a full three months' rent remains unpaid before such an order is granted. The amendments would have the effect of making ground 10 a discretionary rather than a mandatory ground. I understand that under the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 and the Tenants' Rights Etc. (Scotland) Act 1980, now consolidated in the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987, the sheriff, when asked to grant a possession order on the grounds of rent arrears, must first look at the reasonableness of granting such an order. We want to retain that principle, and I hope that the Minister will concede that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we all know from our constituency work, tenants fall into arrears of rent for a wide range of reasons, some of them perfectly understandable and some representing circumstances in which a court
	<span class='label label-info column'>702</span>
and a reasonable landlord should be generous to tenants. For example, illness or loss of employment resulting in reduced income may well by short-term difficulties from which the tenant soon recovers but which make it difficult for him to carry on paying his debts. Marital breakdown frequently results in financial problems. Often someone who has recently become a single parent takes time to get his or her finances sorted out. One thinks immediately of the problems that can arise in relation to claims for housing benefit. It can take a few months for such claims to be processed, especially where there is doubt about a person's income, perhaps because maintenance payments are still being negotiated. Many other difficulties can arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If ground 10 remains mandatory, such tenants experiencing short-term financial difficulties would have no right to have the sheriff look at their individual circumstances. Given the changes to housing benefit and supplementary benefit to be introduced in April this year further delays in assessment may well result—the Minister must know that—making it even more difficult for tenants to budget precisely. As the Bill is drafted, the sheriff has no choice to evict if rent arrears arise in any of those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Shelter (Scotland) has highlighted the implications of this ground remaining mandatory where a tenant has exercised his common law right to withhold rent because his landlord has failed to honour repairing obligations. As I understand it, as the Bill stands, the sheriff would still have to order repossession against such a tenant, regardless of the fact that the tenant was withholding his rent on justifiable grounds under the common law of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, it is not unheard of for landlords to refuse to accept rent from tenants when they wish to seek possession of the property. The inclusion of ground 10 as a mandatory ground would appear to allow the sheriff no discretion to consider whether the tenant had offered to pay the landlord rent which he had refused to accept. In such cases, it is imperative that discretion is exercised by the sheriff. The Committee should demand that the Government alter the status of this ground for possession from mandatory to discretionary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 404 and 395 would ensure that where the sheriff court is obliged to order possession a full three months' rent must remain outstanding. Under the present wording of ground 10, a sheriff would be obliged to grant possession if a tenant owed any amount of rent over a three-month period. Arguably, that could be a nominal sum, perhaps as low as £1, which remained unpaid for a period of three months. We know from bitter experience in our constituencies that housing benefit recipients are generally paid in the middle of the rental period, thus they often cannot meet their contractual obligations to make payment in advance at the beginning of the month. Such tenants are always about two weeks behind with rent payments, notwithstanding the fact that their rent is generally paid two weeks before the end of the period to which it relates. I fear that the loose wording of ground 10 could necessitate the sheriff granting possession in every such instance,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0464">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>703</span>
where the landlord sought to close the trap on the tenant. That cannot be reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 391 would prevent tenants being evicted when there are no outstanding rent arrears at the time of the court hearing. It is against the principles of natural justice to allow a tenant to be evicted when he or she has no outstanding rent arrears. Late payment of housing benefit, for example, could lead to arrears being outstanding at the date on which proceedings for possession were begun, but those arrears might be paid in full by the time the court hearing took place. Court time could be wasted where landlords initiate court proceedings against tenants whom they wish to evict, even though they may be aware that the rent will be forthcoming in full within a matter of days. Such cases might result in costs going against tenants, even where no possession order is granted, thus creating financial difficulties. That is another aspect of ground 10 which seems to be totally unjustifiable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move on to ground 11 and amendment No. 242. The implication of ground 11 is that many tenants could be evicted whenever the landlord chose to begin proceedings. What is the definition of "persistently"? It would be difficult to establish a consistent definition of that word. The result of using ground 11 is that sheriffs might be obliged to grant decrees against tenants who had perhaps had clear rent accounts over two years or more, provided the landlord could establish that they had been late persistently with rent payments over some previous period. The loose wording of the ground would allow that to happen, resulting in hardship to tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The implications of a ground allowing for possession order being mandatory even where there are no arrears but where there has been persistent late payment are particularly serious for housing benefit recipients. We have already referred to that. Excluding delays in benefit assessment and payment, monthly housing benefit is generally paid two weeks in arrears and two weeks in advance, with all pay dates on a specified date, usually mid-month. Given that tenancy contracts generally state that the rent for the coming month is due in advance on the first day of each month, every tenant in receipt of housing benefit will technically be a persistent late payer of rent and a possession order under ground 11 will have to be granted if the landlord starts proceeding. This will apply even where payment of housing benefit is made direct to the landlord from housing benefit sections. Administratively it is not possible for the DHSS to pay each individual claimant according to his individual terms of contract. Eviction in such circumstances must be guarded against, as rent is not being persistently withheld. The timing of payments is simply outwith the tenants' control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of other aspects of the grounds are extremely worrying. We welcomed the Minister's statement last week that he intended to review these grounds and move them from the mandatory to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>704</span>
discretionary part of the schedule. The examples of hardship and unreasonable circumstances which I cited in my introduction to this group of admendments demonstrate that it is vital that the Minister should make substantial concessions if tenants are not be evicted on totally unjustifiable grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill has all to do with encouraging private landlords and giving them major new privileges and rights to exploit and harass tenants. A window-dressing clause on harassment will be considered later. If grounds 10 and 11 do not amount to massive scope for harassment and unfair eviction of tenants in Scotland, I do not know what does. I hope that we shall be able to improve that situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Non-payment of rent also appears as ground 1 in the 1984 Act and concerns tenants in the public sector. It appears that in the past local authorities have not been slow to evict tenants on the ground of non-payment of rent. I mention that as a background fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments deal with grounds 10, 11 and 12 on rent arrears. Different considerations apply to each ground. Ground 12 is probably the least contentious. It is a discretionary ground which allows the sheriff to grant possession to the landlord when any rent was due when the landlord gave notice that he intended to begin proceedings. Amendment No. 391 tries to tighten the provision by requiring the rent to be in arrears at the date of the hearing as well. I considered the amendment carefully, but unfortunately in the past tenants have on occasions paid their arrears at the last moment when court proceedings have just begun. That imposes difficulties on the landlord. It is a matter of getting the right balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The insertion of this stipulation is not necessary. We should trust the sheriff to use sensibly the discretion that he has in relation to this ground. I expect that normally, if the rent arrears have been paid before the hearing, the sheriff will not grant the landlord possession, but he should be left the opportunity to do so if extreme circumstances warrant it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ground 11 applies when the tenant has persistently delayed paying rent lawfully due. The honourable Gentleman asked me for a definition of "persistently". I cannot do better than the dictionary definition. Every word in legislation does not need to be precisely defined; most of the words must be presumed to have their ordinary meaning. "Persistently" means "repeatedly" or "over a long time". The circumstance envisaged by ground 11 can cause real hardship to a landlord who may have to spend money on repairs to the house but regularly receives late the rent due. Honourable Members will accept that persistent delay in paying rent should be a ground for possession. The question is whether it should be mandatory or discretionary as proposed by amendments Nos. 242 and 243. As I have already told the Committee, I have been struck by the force of the arguments in favour of introducing an element of discretion in ground 11 and am considering the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0465">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>705</span>
best way to achieve that. On that basis, I hope that those two amendments will be withdrawn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ground 10 specified three months' arrears and is a more difficult matter. It seems that, if a landlord has served notice that he intends to begin proceedings and the three months' rent arrears is still unpaid by the time of the hearing, he can expect to be able to regain possession. It is therefore right that he should have a guarantee that he can regain his property. Honourable Members will realise that I do not think that ground 10 should be made discretionary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the honourable Gentleman's point but, as ground 10 stands, it simply states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"some rent lawfully due from the tenant is more than three months in arrears".</p></blockquote>
That could be pennies. The sheriff would have no option but to evict.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall look again at ground 10. My present inclination is that it should remain mandatory rather than discretionary. While I am dealing with ground 10 perhaps I may refer to amendments Nos. 316, 404 and 395. I assure the honourable Member that ground 10 should apply only when three months' rent is owing, which I think is one of his worries. I shall bring forward an amendment on Report to achieve that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Honourable Members are no doubt concerned that a tenant withholding rent legitimately because of a dispute with his landlord could be subject to eviction under the grounds covered in amendments Nos. 343, 344 and 345. I assure them that the fact that the landlord had defaulted in an obligation would be a defence for the tenant if that landlord sought possession on one of those grounds. It is not therefore necessary to amend the grounds as proposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the last point, I am intrigued by what the Minister has said. I have not had the opportunity to research the subject, but I am prepared to accept the view put forward by Shelter. It believes that the Minister is incorrect when he says that the tenant would have a defence against action being taken if he withholds rent as he now has the right to do in certain cases. The grounds in the schedule are mandatory and there is no opportunity for defence. The sheriff is given no discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be happy to accept what the Minister says if he can justify it. I see that the cavalry is coming to his aid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ground 11 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Whether or not any rent is in arrears on the date on which proceedings for possession are begun, the tenant has persistently delayed paying rent which has become lawfully due."</p></blockquote>
The emphasis is on the words "lawfully due". If the landlord had defaulted on his obligations, that would be a defence, depending upon the facts of the individual case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an intriguing prospect. There are courts that I can think of which would define "lawfully due" as in terms of the contract. However,
	<span class='label label-info column'>706</span>
I understand that the Minister is committed to reconsidering the status of ground 11.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also worried about ground 10. I accept the Minister's assurance that it would require a total of three months' rent to be outstanding, and not just any amount for three months, before action could be taken against a tenant. There are, however, many circumstances in which rent arrears arise. I accept that landlords who have an interest in a property are entitled to see the benefit of letting it. However, I have experience of the many difficulties involved. There is the example cited by my honourable Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) of difficulties arising through marital problems. That can throw couples into distress, but I have also had experience of cases where there has been no marital difficulty until it has been discovered by way of a summons through the door that one of the parties has not been paying the rent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Problems can also be caused by delays in the payment of housing benefit. Such delays are inherent in the system, given the checks that have to be made into the background of any benefit claim. I have acted for both tenants and landlords who have become frustrated by difficulties caused in that way. It is difficult sometimes for local authorities to do all that in the time limit and then process the payment. That creates an immediate difficulty for the tenant when this ground stands on its own as a mandatory ground. The rent has become lawfully due and the sheriff has no discretion to consider it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister rightly referred to case 1 in schedule 2 to the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984. It is right and proper that any tenant who falls into arrears should at least come under consideration for eviction from his property. The Minister did not say that case 1 gives the sheriff a discretion. He is entitled to look at the whole position, at whatever has brought the parties to the court, at disputes between them, at what has caused the persistent failure, if a persistent failure is alleged, or what has caused the delay of three months, and he is entitled to exercise a discretion in making his decision. Other provisions in the Act protect the tenant, but none of that is here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said earlier in response to my honourable Friend the Member for East Lothian that we should trust the sheriffs to make the right decisions in the circumstances. Why does he not trust the sheriffs in the case of ground 10 and allow discretion? The courts have operated these provisions fairly successfully since they were introduced in the 1960s and I am certainly not aware of any cause for concern. Allowing discretion would mean that both parties could go to court to argue their case and have the matter independently judged. Leaving ground 10 as a mandatory ground would give serious cause for concern. Unless the Minister has done his research and homework and can provide us with solid evidence to say that there are problems, why does he insist that ground 10 should stay mandatory?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) said that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0466">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>707</span>
he accepted my assurance on ground 10. I wish him to be in no doubt that I shall table amendments on Report to ensure that ground 10 should apply only when three months' rent is owing. I have already undertaken to reconsider ground 11. Ground 10 is the most extreme case of tenants who do not pay rent, and it seems appropriate that it should remain mandatory. Non-payment of rent under the 1984 and 1987 Acts, both in the private and public sectors, were mandatory grounds. I realise that I probably have not convinced the honourable Gentleman about ground 10, but I have moved some way on ground 11 and shall table the amendments that I have mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the Minister has convinced anyone. He said last week that he would shift ground 11 into the discretionary category and for that we are grateful. He is now making some slight movement on ground 10. I think that he is saying that the intention is that it will be possible for a landlord to gain possession of a property only if the tenant is three months in total in arrears in his rent, not only at the time that proceedings are initiated but also at the time that the hearing takes place. The little word "some" comes out. In other words, it will not be possible for a landlord to evict if the tenant is only £1 or £2 or £3 adrift in his rent payments at that stage. Again, that is a significant shift, but the Minister has not said a word about the problems of housing benefit claims—problems that are likely to become considerably worse as a result of the new regime that is to be ushered in in April this year with the social fund, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the housing benefit system it is inevitable that claimants whose rent comes from that source will be persistently in arrears. Yet, under ground 10, they could be at risk of being evicted at almost any time. It seems to be a fairly fruitful exercise to apply pressure on the Minister, because every time we say we do not like something, he jumps up and says that he will look at it again. He will be hard at work looking at these matters between now and Report, and I fear that we could be in for a rather busy Report stage. Nevertheless, any headway is welcome. It would be useful if the Minister would tell us a little more about the predicament of housing benefit claimants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I should have thought that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>708</span>
Minister might prefer to draw a veil over that provision. He is right to say that we shall debate it at some length. The trouble is that, if we wait until then and do not put more pressure on the Minister at this stage, ground 10 in all its glory will be left on the Bill. We believe that it is a pernicious ground in the context of the new assured tenancy system which the Minister is trying to usher in, and I have no intention of seeking to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I hope that the amendment commend itself to the Committee. It seeks to bring into ground 15 the words used in the equivelent provision relating to secure tenants in the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987. As drafted ground 15 can arise only if a tenant is a nuisance to his immediate neighbours.

	<br><blockquote><p>"and the court is satisfied that the landlord requires the house for a person employed or to be employed by the landlord."</p></blockquote>
The amendment intends to give some protection to the tenant who, in the course of his employment, occupies a house which is not immediately required by the landlord or his employer. The justification for that is that, where a tenant relies on his landlord both for his house and for his livelihood, that places him in a particularly vulnerable position. Anyone who loses his employment, regardless of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0467">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>709</span>
circumstances, is in a personal crisis and to lose one's home at the same time would be a double blow. It is accepted that where the landlord requires the house to carry out the job properly, and the tenant will have to be removed, but the amendment seeks to give the tenant a breathing space and the opportunity to find alternative accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must look at changes in employment practice, and I have some examples from Shelter. The obvious one is agriculture. Changes in agricultural technique mean that many houses are not now used for their original purposes. If there is a redundancy, that does not necessarily mean that another employee will come in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ground 17 is quite stark and leaves no options, although the sheriff has a discretion. However, it gives the sheriff no guidance on how he should operate the discretion. It simply applies when.
	<br><blockquote><p>"The house was let to the tenant in consequence of his employment by the landlord seeking possession or a previous landlord under the tenancy and the tenant has ceased to be in that employment."</p></blockquote>
We contrast that with the provisions of the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984. For example, case 7 begins:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where the dwelling-house is reasonably required by the landlord for occupation as a residence for some person engaged in his whole-time employment."</p></blockquote>
Therefore that conditions is already written into the 1984 Act. It is difficult to see why the Government have decided that the sheriff should have a discretion, when they have given him no guidence on the element of "reasonableness".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has said throughout that the Government intend to release housing on to the private rented market and increase choice; and there are all the other fine statements that the Government have made. We must challenge the philosophy behind this ground, because it does not relate to increasing the private sector stock or to a landlord's right to achieve the best return. It relates to employment and to houses made available in the course of employment, and that is a different set of concepts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel very strongly about this matter, not only because party policy on tied housing but because of constituency experience of the abuse of this system and personal exposure to the way in which the system operates in agriculture. I suspect that the Minister will tell us that this ground does not apply to agriculture-tied housing, but it is clearly relevant in the general debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My honourable Friend for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) is right. As the ground stands, any employer who lets the house in connection with that employment will have a ground to request a sheriff to grant possession of the property when the individual leaves his employment. There is no nonsense about that. There will be no debate on whether he needs the house for a replacement employee or for other purposes. The sheriff will be required under ground 17, as currently drafted, to exercise his discretion.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1976, my honourable Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Strang), when a junior Minister at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, took through the House the Rent (Agriculture) Bill, which amended the legislation as it affected England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It ensured that a farmer could not evict an employee or former employee unless he could demonstrate to an independent advisory committee that the house was needed for an incoming worker. I have been advised by people in agriculture that the system works well in England and Wales and is beneficial. Many cases have been taken out of the courts. Problem cases can be dealt with informally and the local authority can be given fair warning that rehousing is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system has taken the spectre of eviction out of the relationship between employer and employee in England and Wales. That is not so in Scotland unfortunately. We were unable to effect that reform in Scotland and a pernicious system still operates. I come across it fairly regularly in my constituency work. Former employees who have perhaps retired after a lifetime's work on a farm are unceremoniously evicted through the crude, legal process under the legislation. It is unnecessary, and there is a more humane, practical and reasonably alternative to this system. The Bill could provide a way to reform it. Reform of tied housing system in Scotland is long overdue. I regret that the Government appear to be re-enacting it in the Bill. I hope that the Minister will say something useful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the honourable Gentleman acknowledges, they are not assured tenancies. Under paragraphs (5) and (6) of schedule 4, they are excluded from the terms of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The kind of firm that could be caught adversely by the terms of this amendment is a building firm with a contract to build some houses. It may need temporily to house some employees. Amendment No. 393 would leave it with an obligation once the job was done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment assumes that, when an employee leaves employment, another employee of the same landlord will need to occupy the house. That assumption is not correct. The employee's job may simply have disappeared because the employer decided that no one was needed for the post or, more likely, because the work had come to an end. I cited the example of a building contractor who had completed building a number of houses. A house may be needed for a new employee, but because of different organisational arrangements, the new employee may be an employee not of the original landlord but of a sub-contractor or an associated company. Amendment No. 393 would force the employer, who is almost certainly not principally in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0468">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>711</span>

	<p>The amendment stands in the name of the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) who is unable to be with us this morning.</p>
	<p>I understand that this is a new ground for possession that has been suggested by Age Concern Scotland. I admit that I have some misgivings about the way in which it is drafted and its possible effect.

We did not inclue this ground in schedule 5 because one of our aims was to simplify the grounds for possession and to make the procedure more simple to understand for both tenant and landlord alike. The kind of case to which the honourable Gentleman has alluded would normally be covered by ground 2, which is, of course, mandatory.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Part III of schedule 5 deals with suitable alternative accommodation and refers to comparisons with accommodation that might be provided by the local authority in the neighbourhood of the house, the possession of which the landlord is seeking to recover. The reference to a local authority in this context is undersirable, given the extent of SSHA developments, but perhaps more specifically in relation to new towns. I know that from my experience in my constituency of East Kilbride that there are areas within new towns where no local houses exist. The effect of the amendment is, in a sense, to redefine "local authority" to read "public sector landlord", which takes account of the point that I have just made about the SSHA developments and the new towns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In assessing the availability and, more important, the standard of available accommodation, reference should be made to a public sector landlord rather than to a local authority. The amendments are not just reasonable. They are important because they take account of the reality of areas within the Scottish housing sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram) has put forward a persuasive case. I am attracted by the amendment, which seeks to substitute "public sector landlord" for "local authority". I am again slightly amused that the honourable Gentleman should place such trust in Scottish Homes, which will be included
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0469">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>713</span>
in the future category as well as the new towns. Be that as it may, the principle of the amendments seems right: Scottish Homes or a new town seems as trustworthy as local authorities for the purpose of issuing a certificate saying that suitable alternative accommodation is available. Unfortunately, the amendments are not technically right—for example, there is no definition of a public sector landlord—so I should be grateful if the honourable Gentleman would seek to withdraw his amendment to allow me to consider the matter further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a matter of the public sector landlords being more trustworthy.

	<p>No. 350, in page 59, line 37, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"8. In this part of this Schedule "standard of facilities" means the inclusion with the house of a garden, the provision of central heating or any other facility which is a reasonably standard feature of accommodation certified in terms of sub-paragraph 1 (a) above or is a facility of the house in respect of which the landlord is seeking an order for possession.".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments deal with what appears to be—I hope only appears—a disturbing feature of the Bill. Part III of schedule 5 appears to introduce the prospect of a landlord being allowed to move a tenant down market if he falls on hard times. In support of that contention, I refer the Committee to paragraph 3(1)(b) of part III of the schedule, which states:
	<span class='label label-info column'>714</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"reasonably suitable to the means of the tenant and to the needs of the tenant and his family as regards extent and character".</p></blockquote>
That is a most insidious phrase, because it appears to mean that a low standard of accommodation would be deemed to be suitable if the tenant were either on a low income at the time of possession or in receipt of benefit. Amendment No. 346 seeks to make the two grounds set out in subparagraphs (1)(a) and (b) joint grounds instead of separate grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment Nos. 348 and 349 add the new ground of the concept of "standard of facilities" and amendment No. 350 defines that phrase. It could mean the inclusion of a garden, the provision of central heating or any other facility which is a reasonably standard feature of accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 3(1)(b) is a disturbing provision. In view of the time, I shall leave the matter there. The debate may continue into the next sitting. It all depends on what the Minister says. If he is prepared to accept the reasonableness of the amendments, we can make progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the amendments have positive points, but they are all unnecessary. Amendment No. 346 would reduce the options for the sheriff in exercising his discretion in deciding whether accommodation is suitable. If paragraph 3(1)(a) of part III of the schedule is fulfilled, paragraph 3(1)(b) would have to be fulfilled too, but paragraph 3(1)(b) is designed to provide a further test of suitability if paragraph 3(1)(a) cannot be met.
