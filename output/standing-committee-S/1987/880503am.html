	<div class='clause'>Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>CONSTITUTION OF SCHOOL BOARDS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [28 April]:</i> No. 10, in page 1, line 12, at end insert,
	<br><blockquote><p>(c) Any functions delegated to them by the Secretary of State in exercising his powers under sections 73 to 75 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 and under this Act.".—[	<i>Mr. Allan Stewart.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this it will be convenient to take new clause 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Grant-maintained schools</i></p>
	<p>"(1) The Secretary of State may provide for the establishment of grant-maintained schools, subject to the provisions of this section, and financed under section 73 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980.</p>
	<p>(2) The Secretary of State shall arrange for a secret ballot to be held on the question of whether grant-maintained status should be sought where he receives a written request for such a ballot from a number of parents of registered pupils at the school equal to at least 20 per cent of the number of registered pupils at the school on the date on which the request is received.</p>
	<p>(3) The Secretary of State may ask the School Board to conduct the ballot, or make such other arrangements as he considers appropriate.</p>
	<p>(4) Where the result of a ballot held in accordance with subsection (2) above shows a simple majority in favour of seeking grant-maintained status for the school, the Secretary of State shall publish a draft instrument in accordance with which the school is to be governed (to be known as the articles of government).</p>
	<p>(5) After consultation with the education authority, the articles of government of the school shall be made by order of the Secretary of State. The articles will provide for the constitution of a board of management for the grant-maintained school.</p>
	<p>(6) On an incorporation date determined by the Secretary of State in relation to a grant-maintained school, the property rights and liabilities of the education authority formerly responsible for the school shall be transferred to, and by virtue of this Act rest in, the board of management of the grant-maintained school.".</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At our previous sittings I sought to assure my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) that the Bill stands in its own right as a means of involving parents in the management of our schools, and that the Government would not rule out his proposal that opting-out should be an extension of parental choice. As my hon. Friend pointed
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>160</span>
out, we have a working model in Jordanhill. At present, we should keep these matters in view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I should point to the publication of a MORI poll in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> yesterday. Opposition Members argued that there was no demand for opting-out, apart from in one or two schools prompted by particular difficulties that arose. The hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) made that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cumbernauld and Kilsyth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister is so enthusiastic about opinion polls, does he accept the findings in 	<i>The Times</i> yesterday which suggested that the Conservatives would be wiped out in the district elections?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The real anxiety that the hon. Gentleman should have is that the MORI poll in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> shows that twice as many people—46 per cent. instead of the 23 per cent who intended to vote Conservative according to that poll—support our proposals on testing in primary schools, and considerably more support opting-out. The poll shows that the broad thrust of our education policies are popular well beyond those who intended to vote Conservative. I hope that that will persuade the hon. Gentleman that, instead of following on the coat tails on the Educational Institute of Scotland, to think about the impact of the policies and perhaps take on board some of the arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend acknowledge, as he did at our previous sitting, that a MORI poll in a country such as Scotland does not necessarily reflect the same level of opinion across the whole of Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right honourable Friend is right to point that out. As the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) nods vigorously, he might take on board the regional variation. I have not seen the figure, but I understand that it shows that support for opting-out is higher in Strathclyde and Lothian than in other parts of Scotland. Since most of the people live in Strathclyde and Lothian, that shows a fair degree of support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend also acknowledge that a higher proportion of voters vote Conservative in areas outside Strathclyde and Lothian?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I happily acknowledge that, as I acknowledge that a higher proportion outside Lothian and Strathclyde send their children to independent schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps the Minister will address his remarks to the Chair and not to the back of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Knox.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend the Minister bear in mind that the largest Conservative share of the poll happens to be in my constituency where there is interest in opting-out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0842">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>161</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No doubt that is because my hon. Friend has been a vigorous proponent of opting-out and a vigorous supporter of our education policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I intended to speak briefly, and that is still my intention. Opposition Members must ask themselves why this MORI poll has shown such support for opting-out in contradiction to the speeches made at our previous sitting. The Bill is not intended as a vehicle for opting-out—we have taken no decisions on future legislation—but I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) for giving us the opportunity to debate this issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this debate not because it will lead to a decision on opting-out but because it is important for Scottish education as a trailer to the more meaningful debate which is likely to take place in the next few years. A prominent Back Bench Conservative has tabled a new clause which has captured the imagination of the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), the Minister responsible for education in Scotland. Clearly, this is the beginning of a long discussion on whether Scottish schools should be allowed to opt-out of the state sector. Despite the knockabout politics of our deliberations, this issue is very serious and should be the focus of educationists, parents and politicians of all persuasions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has just said that the debate is about schools being allowed to opt-out of state education. That analysis of the issue is incomprehensible. It is about schools being allowed to opt-out of the local authority sector into the central Government sector. It is a debate within the state system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to get bogged down in semantics. I used the convenient form of shorthand to describe what the debate is about. I shall develop the idea further and come on to the points raised by the hon. Member for Eastwood about the significance of the opting-out of schools from the local authority system and where the line of thinking taken by certain hon. Members, including the Minister, will lead Scottish education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard much about the justification for inserting such a provision in the Bill. The Minister and other Conservative Members asked why the Labour Opposition believe that there is no demand for such a provision but are worried about the consequences of this measure. The two aspects are consistent. Despite the Government's suggestions to the contrary, there is mistrust in Scotland about the Government's policy on local authority education. We need look no further than the consultation process on the school board proposals to know why that mistrust has emerged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition have argued that there may be an interest in parental involvement, but that there is not much interest in school board proposals. A sample taken during the consultation process showed that only 3 per cent were interested in the Government's proposals. Despite that telling finding, however, we are still to have school boards in Scotland. The Government say that there is a demand for the idea,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>162</span>
but in fact they have created that demand. There is no justification for the Government's proposals for school boards, but the Government have relegated public opinion to the back seat and are developing their own ideology. If there is no demand for their ideas, they either create some demand or ignore public criticism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must not misrepresent the consultation process. We had an unprecedented response and there was unprecedented debate throughout schools in Scotland. I spoke at a number of meetings which were well attended. The hon. Gentleman cannot say that there was no interest in the proposals. Nor is it correct to say that only 3 per cent were interested in the idea of school boards. Virtually every submission that we received stated that parents should be more involved in schools. The strongest representation that we received was that each school should have a board, so we amended our proposals accordingly. The hon. Gentleman really must not misrepresent the consultation process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his intervention because it clearly justifies my point. The Government clearly believe that "parental choice" equates with "school boards". What we have—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, not at this stage. I shall give way to you so that you can tell the Committee about your speech in a moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am not aware that I have made a speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) is going to tell us shortly about a speech in which he waxed eloquent about the distinction between school boards and parental involvement. The Government have consistently given the impression—in the media, in the Committee and elsewhere—that "parental choice" equates with "school boards". I agree that Scottish people wish to see more parental involvement in schools. I am among the many people who criticise local authorities, including my own—Fife regional council—for their lack of interest in developing parental involvement, but it is a massive leap from the desire for parental involvement and the Government's proposals for school boards, which attach many other characteristics to parental involvement. They represent tokenism and not full-scale parental involvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister jumped in to talk about misrepresentation. The issues at stake are, first, parental involvement and secondly, whether school boards are the best way forward. We believe that the second issue is not clear but the Government believe that school boards are the only way forward. That is the essential difference between the Opposition and the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that school boards were about parental choice. They are not. School boards are about parental involvement. That is a fundamental difference. Opting-out is about choice and school boards are about parental involvement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0843">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>163</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may be confused, but I am not confused. The clause is about opting-out. I am talking about opting-out within the context of the Bill. The essential point is about parental involvement, not choice. There are significant differences between those two things. It is useful for the Government to interject. They have monopolised the questions of choice and involvement, but many of their arguments are bogus. A proper debate would be about Scottish parents becoming more involved in Scottish education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Bill Walker) wishes to read his newspaper, he shoud do so in such a way that I cannot see him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Knox, I am preparing my speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That makes no difference. The hon. Gentleman must do so in such a way that I do not see him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether I should be flattered, or whether 	<i>The Scotsman</i> should be flattered that the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) reads that paper. If the hon. Gentleman listens to my contribution, however, he may have a few points to throw back later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was talking about extending parental involvement and the Government's obsession with equating it with their school board proposals. The clause is important and I take it seriously. There is a tendency to say, "Well, it is the ideologues at work". I am sure that that is right, but the proposals will return to the House in the next two or three years. That is why we must tackle the Government head-on about the phrases that they use and have tried to capture for themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the question of the Government being able to create a demand for a particular idea. I too read with interest the MORI poll in yesterday's edition of 	<i>The Scotsman.</i> I was very interested in the question posed and am sure that the Under-Secretary of State expects me to mention the way in which it was asked. Under the heading "Control of Schools", the question was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Do you support or oppose the proposal that parents should be allowed to take their school out of local education authority control if a majority of parents wish to do so?"</p></blockquote>
If the question had been asked without the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"if a majority of parents wish to do so",</p></blockquote>
the result would have been different. It was a pollster's dream question, because the question was posed for the substance of the issue but then qualified by the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"by the majority of parents",</p></blockquote>
which is emotive and strikes a chord with many parents in Scotland. The result of the poll was interesting, but
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>164</span>
it does not reinforce the arguments of Conservative members that there is a demand for opting-out in Scotland. I was more encouraged by other parts of the poll—despite the shortcomings of the questions posed—which showed the support for mainstream educational provision in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious about the Government's arguments about justification and demand. I shall try to highlight what we believe to be the real reasons for the legislation. We may talk about the Prime Minister's intervention in the debate, the involvement of the editor of 	<i>The Times</i> and Paisley grammar school, but other more substantial political issues are involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to draw the Committee's attention to the Omega report on Scottish policy, which was produced in 1983 by the Adam Smith Institute. Although the Under-Secretary of State may not have actually written the document—
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[	<i>Interruption</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will rephrase my remark. I am very pleased to bring to the Committee's notice a substantial report in which the Under-Secretary of State participated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was not a Government report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are seeking a debate on how the idea of opting-out emerged. It did not emerge from an analysis of Scottish education and the needs of parents. It would be useful to quote two or three remarks from the Omega report, which set the ideological scene. The report gives a concise analysis of Scottish education. It was prepared in 1983 and there has been time to develop the ideas since then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to Scottish education the report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The fall has come through through three main channels: the general intellectual downgrading of the idea of excellence; a failure to keep up with the expansion of knowledge and the changing needs of the economy, reflected in outdated curricula; and"—</p></blockquote>
this is an interesting idea—
	<br><blockquote><p>"incessant political interference and changes of aim".</p></blockquote>
Clearly, the people who wrote that were good on ideology but their grammar and presentation were suspect. However, we can get the drift of their argument. The report says that Scottish education had many weaknesses: it had failed on excellence and failed to keep up with new technology and changing needs, and political interference was becoming a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Page 30 of the report deals with the idea of school councils being upgraded. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Another extension which could lead to exciting developments would be for the councils to be granted the power to take their schools out of the state system".</p></blockquote>
That comment is followed by a very important point:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This might be a very attractive option in times of budgetary stringency, and could lead to the saving of many small schools in time of recession".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0844">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>165</span>
I stress that point because the opt-out proposals do not emerge from an analysis of the Scottish education system or any instinct for it per se.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The climate of economic circumstances in local government could lead to schools that have a variety of pressures wishing to create that demand. We are not running away from the fact that Strathclyde has had genuine difficulties but we know that over the past eight or nine years there has been a massive attack on the funding of the whole fabric of local authority provisions, including education. So it is clear that what is written in the report, in biblical terms, has come to pass. Such proposals would previously have been regarded as odious, unacceptable and lacking in any instinct for culture and education in Scotland and would have been rejected, but the Government are trying to capture a moment in the development of education in Scotland when several factors have come together so as to make inroads into the authority setup.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As it is important that we know what the Government are about, I shall make one more point about the report. The Social Affairs unit refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the educational standards of the students who will become their 'raw material'".</p></blockquote>
The Omega report is interesting because it sets out its ideas in a courageous, ideological way. That committee was regarded as a crank outifit on the extremes of legitimate politics and threw in ideas that most sane people, whether they be Tory or Labour, would regard as rather eccentric. Unfortunately, however, what was regarded as rather eccentricity a few years ago is now in the forefront of Government thinking on Scottish education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have taken some time to give that explanation because when we see those fine words "choice" and "parental involvement" and all the other caring phrases that will capture support in Scotland it is crucial that we know what they stem from—a hard-Right ideology that has percolated into official Government thinking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another Omega File report entitled "A Comprehensive Review of Government Functions" was published in 1985. I do not know whether the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Stirling, was involved in that. We have discussed creating the conditions for change and about opting-out proposals, but I now want to give the Committee a foretaste of what might be envisaged if those steps are taken in Scottish and English education. The report develops the theme of choice and opting-out and goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Teachers' salaries would no longer be determined on a national basis, but by each school. Schools might wish to institute different grades of salary for different qualities of teacher. However, national guidelines would exist for the provision of non-teaching services."</p></blockquote>
That looks into the crystal ball of the Government's embrace of the privatisation of the school system. The report goes on to a most remarkable paragraph, which requires airing, about independence. The coding becomes clearer as we progress through the reports. The 1985 Omega File report says:
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>166</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Given their independence, schools will be able to make a very large number of operational changes which might not appear to be so bold in scope, but which may be just as important to delivering good education cheaply; and undoubtedly a number of penetrating organisational questions will be asked."</p></blockquote>
Some of those "penetrating organisational questions" are as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Are large windows really desirable, given that they distract students' attention and are a big maintenance problem?"</p></blockquote>
You have heard of education in the dark, Mr. Knox, but that brings a new dimension to it. The report continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Are carpets actually more efficient than hard floors, given their soundproofing capability and their effect on morale? Can school scholarships be given in return for parents or children helping with work around the school?"</p></blockquote>
I am reading this report seriously, but it is taking some effort. It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Is a large library a necessity or an indulgence? Should charges be made for non-essential equipment, and so on?"</p></blockquote>
[	<i>Interruption.</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to hear, "Hear, hear!". Many Conservative Members clearly support the report and the ideology it embraces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Omega File of 1985 also says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Changing population trends or disastrous management could still leave classrooms bare"—</p></blockquote>
I think that means bare and empty—
	<br><blockquote><p>"However, in a market structure, the entry of new services and the exit of old ones is an essential feature that keeps innovation on the march and ensures that resources are steered towards successful alternatives."</p></blockquote>
I have tried to chart the development of thinking that was first rooted in the local authority education sector. Two reports, one for Scotland and the other for England, said that opting-out would perhaps be useful. That argument was then developed by the statement that opting-out would be a precursor of independent schools. I highlighted briefly some of the crazy suggestions in the reports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is serious that what was regarded previously as eccentricity is now, if not mainstream Government thinking—that would be an insult to many hon. Members, including the right honourable member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith), who take a principled, decent view of Scottish education—emerging into the mainstream debate.

I apologise if I have caused long-term damage to the right honourable Gentleman, although I am sure that I have not. That proposal, which is the first step toward the new educational paradise of the hard Right, is now before a Committee. I regret this black day for Scottish education.

I have examined the background, have touched upon the question of demand in the Government's arguments and have hinted that the Government do not need a justification to implement their proposals. Last week I asked the Minister to be complimentary about the local authority sector in Scotland. He said, but with a grudging reluctance, that there were many good aspects of local authority education. The Government may be right to criticise us for being negative, but one must be negative when in Opposition. We should be talking about the quality of primary and secondary education in Scotland, especially the virtues of the comprehensive sector. That has been one of the biggest success stories since the war in any aspect of Government policy in terms of choice, egalitarianism and equal access to education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a brave Government, even a foolish one, who challenge those improvements and the benefits that have accrued to Scottish education without thinking through the consequences of creating limited extra choice, which must be sanctioned by the cheque book, for a small group of schools and parents. They must also consider the impact that that could have on the real question of choice and access to education for the vast majority of pupils and parents who are satisfied with the quality of local authority education throughout the United Kingdom, and certainly in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say that in relation to regional councils controlled by other parties—in Lothian and Tayside there have been improvements since the political changes took place—but I applaud the work done by all political parties in Scotland, and their support for the comprehensive education system. I wonder whether that support is shared by the Government and by Conservative Back Benchers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Eastwood said that one school had a particularly good music department. Every school in Fife has an excellent music department, and the same goes for schools in parts of Tayside and other areas. The Minister talks about choice, but the benefit of a comprehensive education system is that it is comprehensive from aspects such as music and extra curricular activities down to the basic curriculum. That is the meaning of choice—it does not mean that we should elevate certain schools because of their advantages. Comprehensive education has provided such advantages, and that is a core part of the philosophy and practicalities of educational provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman who, today of all days, refers to the opportunities provided by local authorities for music. He may have seen on television last night the competition for young musicians, in which two of the finalists were from St. Mary's school in Edinburgh. That school was saved as a result of Government intervention. The local authority wanted it closed so that it could make provision within the department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a good example of how, by allowing specialisation and diversity outside the local authority system, excellence and opportunity can be provided. As
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>168</span>
Scots, we were proud to witness that on our television screens last night.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that the Minister intervened on that point. By using the word, "finalists", he characterised the fact that the Government are concerned with winners and losers. Our political philosophy on education has no losers. That is a tenuous point, but why argue that some pupils from St. Mary's school are finalists in a music competition because the Government acted as a great benefactor and saved that school from the ogres in the local authority? Again, the Government are taking a one-off situation and trying to build a new education culture around it. In Fife schools, music is available to all children. They do not pay for it, they have instruments and music teachers, and they do not need to go to St. Mary's or elsewhere. The essence of comprehensive provision is that there are no losers, but everyone is a winner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's argument highlights the difficulty in making certain members of the Government realise that the existing system in Scotland is worthwhile and should be protected rather than interrupted by the distractions of opting-out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Great play was made earlier about the question of liberty and freedom of choice. We need no lectures from the Right wing of the Conservative party about those virtues. I still argue that people on both sides of the political divide, whether members of the Labour or the Conservative party, value those qualities, which were fought for in wars. Indeed, they have stood as the basis of the consensus system of British politics for the past 40 years. However, those qualities are now to be hijacked by the hard Right in British Conservative thinking. The Government talk about choice, whereas opting-out will be anti-choice for the majority of children and parents who will remain within the state sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have discussed specifics of geography, such as Strathclyde, and of religious problems. The state sector has perhaps not been as sensitive as it should have been to those real difficulties. However, although the Opposition are willing to concede that state sector comprehensive provision is not ideal, there is no intellectual logic to the argument that that system must evolve quickly to allow opting-out and the privatisation of the state sector of education. That ideology will do immense damage to the comprehensive system which should be developed and given more resources. There could be much more diversification within state sector education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When Scottish people read the worthy newspapers that carry messages from this great House to all parts of Scotland, they must understand what the Government think. It is worrying that when the Government hijack concepts, they are considered to be right, because those concepts strike a chord with everybody. Nobody is against the concept of choice, or individual freedom—everybody wants to promote liberty. However, the Government's concept of liberty and choice is heavily constrained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, since 1979, through propaganda and through cuts, the Government have systematically tried to harm
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0846">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>169</span>
local authority education provision. Secondly, they have recently decided that a major function of education—school meals—will be contracted out. The Government's arguments for that trips off the tongue—value for money. Thirdly, opting-out has now been introduced. Everybody must realise that the Government are not enhancing the quality of education in Scotland, but mounting a major attack without justification or reasoned arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about Notre Dame?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not been to Paris recently. I made my points clear in the previous debate. There is no point in the hon. Member for Eastwood intervening. Scottish education is about Scotland, half of which is about Strathclyde. A classic case for opting-out has been made from a sedentary position. It has to be about pupils from St. Mary's winning music competitions or about particular schools in Strathclyde.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside supported me initially on extending the debate to all of Scotland. For goodness sake, let not the future of Scottish education be based on specific examples being made into a generalised case for wholesale radical changes in Scottish education that have not been worked out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has not dealt with any of my arguments. What is his position on Notre Dame? Is he not aware that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galloway) who is a local Member, supports the continuation of Notre Dame?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are discussing major proposals for setting up school boards throughout Scotland. The new clause deals with opting-out of the local authority sector. It cannot be right for one or two examples to make the case for wholesale changes. However, I have alluded to the difficulties that schools will face because of geography and religion, and because of other genuine considerations throughout Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cannot such an issue be resolved sensitively within the comprehensive system of education in Scotland? Or, is it fortuitous that such issues have emerged and coincide with the Government's wish to push this ideological debate much further? The motives of some Conservative Members in using these examples worry me intensely. Opposition Members accept that there are real problems but we appeal to Conservative Members not to go in for a wholesale savaging of Scottish education to justify the needs of two or three important cases in Scottish schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us stick to Scottish education in broad terms. Opposition Members are frustrated because although Strathclyde is crucial, Fife, Lothian, Tayside, Grampian and the Highlands and Islands are also important. It is crucial that the Committee does not get bogged down by preaching about particular schools, however important their cases may be, thus denying us the right to talk generally about Scottish education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>170</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to speak on the amendment and the new clause. I assure the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) that I am not motivated by anything other than a desire to provide the best possible education opportunities and choice for the children of the parents in my constituency and throughout Scotland. I have no doctrinaire views on this issue. My views have been conditioned by my experience and that of my children, the parents of the children in my constituency and my relatives who live in the Tayside area, many of them in Dundee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For some time schools under local authority control have caused concern. Because of that concern the Government introduced proposals for greater parental involvement. As my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) said, school boards are about parental involvement. In general, the Committee is agreed about the need for parental involvement; the differences of view are on the details.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment and new clause are designed to go beyond the school boards and to introduce choice. Opting-out is about choice. The amendments contain no compulsion; they do not require schools to opt out. The choice will be made only if parents and school board are unhappy with how the local authority's education policy affects their school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are unlikely to be accepted because of technical flaws, so we are discussing the principle. There is no compulsion, so a ballot would occur only as and when circumstances demanded it. That would put pressure on local authorities to behave responsibly and sympathetically. If they did so, it is unlikely that schools would ever opt-out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Worthington 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clydebank and Milngavie)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that if parents wanted to keep a school open and were unhappy with the local education authority, central Government would automatically accede to the wishes of those parents and allow them to opt-out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not saying that. I am speaking to the amendments, which I trust the hon. Gentleman has read. If he reads them carefully, he will see that my right honourable and learned Friend the Secretary of State may ask the school board to conduct a ballot. If the parents of at least 20 per cent of the number of registered pupils at a school requested a ballot, the decision would have to be made whether the school should opt into the Secretary of State's control. That would have to be by agreement with the Secretary of State, and if he agreed, it would happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give the hon. Gentleman an example of the sort of situation that I envisage might arise in future. Let us assume that a school with the necessary 20 per cent support to require a ballot has a vacancy for a headmaster. A headmaster may be appointed who is hostile to the continuation of the school, and he may move there with the definite intention of closing down the school. That may have been part of the deal entered into in the terms of his contract with the local authority, and he may have the tempting offer of another move elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way in a minute. The hon. Gentleman must learn to allow another hon. Member to make his point. If he allows that to happen, he may find that his proposed intervention is unnecessary.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a rural area the parents may feel that what is happening in the school is unacceptable to them. They may then wish to make use of this legislation, if it is enacted, to set the opting-out procedures in motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In our previous sitting the Minister criticised Opposition Members for not objecting when the assertion was made that a local education authority could install a head teacher in order to close a school. I know of no local education authority that has such motives. Will the hon. Gentleman make clear that in many instances if a school decided to opt-out, the Secretary of State would refuse to take it on board?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, the school would have to have a viable number of pupils. If there were an insufficient number of pupils, the school would not be viable because it would depend on the amount allocated per child. It could not continue in those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that the 80 per cent factor may make rural schools viable. That should be taken into account. The important fact is that choice would occur only if the local authority had not behaved in a manner sympathetic to the aspirations of the parents of children attending the school. I hope that, as a result of pressure if the Bill is enacted, the local authorities will become more sympathetic and realise that there is always the possibility that schools can opt-out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) made his views clear last week. I do not doubt his sincerity or integrity, and I hope that he accepts that I am sincere in my views and does not doubt my integrity. It is important to approach these matters objectively. We should not be doctrinaire, and I am not. I have found that things are never quite how they seem and that one should examine matters in depth. I understand the problems of Dundee. I found extensively during the general election that the 40 per cent over-capacity in Dundee is sucking in resources and depriving rural schools both there and elsewhere in Tayside of essential education material, and will continue to do so until something is done about that 40 per cent over-capacity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that he wishes to see secondary schools in Dundee closed in order to reduce the 40 per cent over-capacity there?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be impertinent of me to recommend to the people of Dundee which schools should close and which should remain open. I am not a regional councillor and I have not accepted responsibility for making such decisions. However, if I had, I should have no hesitation in saying which ones should close.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>172</span>
[	<i>Interruption.</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the same way, I have no hesitation in making my views known on other issues affecting Tayside. The education authority, its education department and its councillors are responsible and accountable and they should make the decisions. Everyone knows that making difficult decisions—that is what accountability is about—means making some people unhappy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has misunderstood my question. I did not ask which schools in Dundee he recommended for closure but whether he recommended that any schools should close. Is that what he thinks should be done about the 40 per cent over-capacity?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, the hon. Gentleman is tempting me to make decisions which should properly be made by others. I merely stated that there is 40 per cent overcapacity in Dundee. That means that almost half of the schools in Dundee are not used—they have no children in them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[	<i>Interruption.</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what 40 per cent over-capacity means. The local authority is paying rent, if applicable, rates and heating and lighting bills unnecessarily. This is making a demand on funds and depriving rural schools of essential materials. The problem frequently arises in Tayside and my right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) should be aware of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked during the election campaign how, in my opinion, that problem should be dealt with. The rural schools cannot force the local authority to act in the way that they wish. I said during the campaign that the only way to create the necessary pressure, accountability and responsibility would be for the Government to bring forward opting-out proposals. I made that clear then and I have done so since. The suggestion was not rejected out of hand. Indeed, it was well-received and thoughtfully received. Although, like me, the majority of people would prefer that opting-out did not happen, if it is the only way to bring sanity to the dilemma I believe that it should take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside said that there was no demand. I hope that he accepts that my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood has shown that there is a demand and that the MORI poll demonstrates—I required a newspaper to be certain that I had the facts right, Mr. Knox—that 34 per cent of parents support opting-out. That means that many parents are extremely worried about the state of their children's education and schools. They would not approve a change in the system if they were not worried in the first place. I do not accept that one opinion poll gives a definitive statement of public opinion on such matters. However, the poll shows that there is a demand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gordon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is in favour of Government by opinion poll, will he

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>173</span>
also accept the verdict of the polls on issues such as home rule and competitive tendering?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I am not in favour of government by opinion poll. I am merely answering the points made by my right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside. He said that if at some later stage, there was a demand—and I am paraphrasing him—that may be the right time to bring forward such a proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much has been made of principle. If it is right—I believe that it is—to extend choice, increase accountability and change attitudes, as the Government have done with so much legislation—for example, the sale of council houses—it must be right to extend choice, increase accountability and change attitudes by introducing opting-out. It is important to do so, and often it is merely a matter of changing attitudes. If it were right to adopt privatisation linked to employee shareholding, it must be right to provide for opting-out. If it were right to introduce trade union legislation and so extend choice, increase accountability, restore the trade unions to their members and change attitudes in industry, it must be right to be able to opt-out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The community charge is right, because it extends choice, increases accountability and, more importantly, changes attitudes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. ALICK BUCHANAN-SMITH 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Buchanan-Smith. It is relevant to mention the community charge in the context of the amendment and new clause because a great ceremony was planned in my constituency. I understand that constituents were to collect in their hundreds to burn community charge booklets on a bonfire. That is choice of a sort that I heartily recommend to the Committee. But only four people turned up to the great event: all the others chose to stay away.</p>
	<p>There is a link between the parents' charter and the community charge, trade union legislatoin and privatisation linked to employee shareholding. In all those areas we have extended choice, increased accountability and, probably most important of all, have changed and are changing, attitudes. That is what the amendment and the new clause are about—choice, accountability and changing attitudes. The Opposition are fearful because they know that when the public exercise choice and see increased accountability and a change in attitudes, they realise that the Socialist dogma that everyone is the same is wrong.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a distinction between choice and accountability, but how does the poll tax extend choice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was linking the community charge to the amendment and the new clause. I said that it concerned choice, accountability and changing attitudes. Anyone who examines objectively and logically the way that the Government have introduced their legislation will realise that the common threads have been the extension of choice and the increase of accountability. That was part of the answer I was giving to the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is time that councillors and others were made much more accountable. I want councillors to make decisions and to be more directly involved, but I want them also to be much more directly accountable. That is provides the link with choice, the community charge and opting-out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) said that the Conservative view concerned winners and losers. I do not see life in that way because on that basis I could have been one of the world's losers.

I left school at 14 be a message boy and so could have been classed as a loser, but I defy anyone to say that I can be described as a loser. I do not lose elections either. The hon. Gentleman said that we do not care about all children because of the winners and losers definition. All children are not equal. Each child is an individual and all children are different. The good schools whose teachers care and do their job effectively, as many do, recognise that. They see their task as making children better at the things at which they are already good. That is the difference between the Government and the Opposition. We acknowledge and accept that all children are not equal and that schools should discover what a child is good at and make him or her better at it. Every child is good at something.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If it is right to give parents in England and Wales the opportunity to opt-out, why is it wrong for Scotland? I cannot understand that argument, even from my hon. Friends on the Conservative Benches. There is no compulsion. It is right for people who can afford to choose their children's education to be able to do so. I defend that, even though I did not exercise that right. My children went through the state system. I have no long-term regrets about that, even though there were periods when I was deeply worried and had to use my right under the parents' charter to move my children. That may happen to other members of the Committee later. One of the problems of being in politics is that one comes under enormous pressure. We live in a glasshouse and so, sadly, do our families, who are often exposed to pressures from sources that should not exert them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately, local education authorities did not accept it until we introduced the parents' charter.

I assure him that even on Tayside, which had a responsible authority, parents were not allowed to transfer their children to other schools until the parents' charter came into being. The hon. Gentleman may shake his head, but that is what happened.

I find it difficult to understand that those who support a system allowing parents who can afford it to send their children to fee-paying schools—and thus opt-out of the state system—do not accept the principle of allowing people in the state sector to move from local authority control to the Secretary of State's control if enough of them wish to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says that people will move from local authority control to the Secretary of State's control, but the proposals for opting-out in England do not give the Secretary of State for Education and Science control of the management of a school. Control would remain with the board of management. Opting-out concerns provision of funding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. That is important. If I have said anything misleading, I shall withdraw it, because it must be understood that it is the funding which will come from central Government, and hence from the taxpayer. However, no one can force parents to opt-out. The system will be triggered only if local authorities behave in a manner that causes enough parents to feel unhappy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment and the new clause have given us the opportunity to discuss the principle of opting-out, to show that there is a demand, and to show clearly
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>176</span>
that we hope to do something about that soon in another Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been following my hon. Friend's argument with great interest. Does he agree that the Opposition's allegation that grant-maintained status is a new and alien development in Scottish education does not stand up to examination? We already have a grant-maintained school in Scotland: Jordanhill school. I was astonished to hear the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) say that that school works very well with the education authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that helpful intervention. The entire argument against opting-out is flawed because a school has already opted-out and is functioning. As my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) said, it integrates and works well with the local authority, and there is no reason why it should not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, Central referred to specialist activities. Parents may decide that their school should have better facilities for sports, music, art or drama because a nucleus of children in the local community have talents and skills in those areas. I return to my earlier point: good teachers recognise that their job is to make children better at the subjects for which they already have an aptitude. Schools could and would have specialist departments if there were a local demand, but the local authority may, in its wisdom, decide that it does not want that to happen. For example, in my constituency specialist activities take place in Breadalbane academy, which caters for a rural catchment area and specialises in subjects such as Gaelic. Because of funding problems linked to the 40 per cent overcapacity in Dundee, the local authority has already tried several times to thwart the demand for such specialist departments. If it were to succeed in doing so, rural communities such as that which I represent might have to introduce opting-out if only to increase accountability, which many parents feel is lacking at local authority level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This morning we are engaged in a debate about education philosophy in Scotland. The hon. Gentleman made a specific point about music. The benefit of the comprehensive system, as it operates in Fife and elsewhere in Scotland, is that education is more than just the three Rs. It is a life-enhancing experience. Music, sport, drama and other activities are part and parcel of the environment of opportunities of every child, regardless of income, location, class, sex or race. That is the essence of our political philosophy. What is so wrong with it that the hon. Gentleman wishes to change it by injecting a distraction called opting-out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must inhabit a different world from that of the parents whom I represent. Not every secondary school in Tayside offers the same opportunities in sports, music, art, drama, for example. If every school in the hon. Gentleman's constituency offers the same opportunities, he is fortunate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>177</span>
I am not criticising Tayside region. I am merely drawing attention to the facts. Some schools offer better opportunities in art, music and drama than others. That is often because of the motivation and quality of the teaching staff, although I do not underestimate home motivation. I have visited all the schools in my constituency and it is my experience that if a teacher has special skills and is highly motivated, his school will offer good educational training and experience for the pupils who opt for his classes. Not every pupil opts for every discipline. Pupils opt for the disciplines in which they think that they can do well. They decide which O-levels and highers to study for and they specialise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right about diversity. The logic of the argument advanced by the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) is absurd in the case of Breadalbane academy offering—quite reasonably—Gaelic. His argument is essentially that there should be equal provision of Gaelic in every school in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is aware that I opposed a ten-minute Bill brought forward by the former right honourable Member for Western Isles, Mr. Donald Stewart, who wished Gaelic to be taught in schools throughout Perthshire. He had forgotten that Perthshire included the Carse of Gowrie, where schools made it clear that they did not wish to teach Gaelic. That did not prevent me from supporting moves for Gaelic to be taught in schools in what would normally be the Gaelic catchment area—the old crofting counties. Gaelic is taught at Breadalbane academy and Blairgowrie high school. Attempts were made to teach it at other schools but not enough children opted for it. They exercised their choice, a concept on which we are so keen. Enough children must opt-in for a course to be viable.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although there is disagreement among Conservative Members on the timescale, there is none on the principle. Those who have doubts about the amendment and the new clause think that this is not the right Bill for them. I do not fully accept that, but I accept that the new clause may be flawed technically. That is always a risk when new clauses are tabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are unable to incorporate the new clause into the Bill, it should be introduced at an early stage in another education Bill, or another Bill that is especially introduced, because Conservative Members wish to increase accountability, to extend choice and, more importantly, to change attitudes. Only when attitudes become constructive, progressive and helpful will schools be brought into the latter part of the 20th century in a way that all Committee Members would agree with. We differ only in the way in which we wish to arrive at that conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons I have no hesitation in supporting my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood. I hope that Opposition Members will realise that we have won the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>178</span>
argument hands down. A school exists, a substantial minority supports the opting-out provision and people in my constituency and in others have been unhappy at the way in which local authorities have managed education affairs and how that has affected their children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. DAVID KNOX 	<i>in the Chair.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a crucial issue which goes to the heart of parental rights and political philosophies. Labour Members support the concept of choice and wish to extend opportunities, but every nation has to decide when the benefit of the majority exceeds any gain that will be made by the few. We oblige every child to receive education but not to go to school. Therefore, an important opting-out right already exists. Parents have the choice to educate their children themselves, and not to send them to school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also legitimate for some schools to be sponsored by religious minorities. We accept the right, albeit somewhat grudgingly, of parents to choose to pay for their children's education. We accept that special schools should be provided for children of lower abilities. Some children, such as the musically talented, have special needs that cannot be catered for without some adaptation being made to the education system. Circus schools in the Soviet Union cater for special children in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But when should special provision for children be accepted, or not accepted because it may damage other people? If an opinion poll were conducted on whether people believed in co-education, there is no doubt that the vast majority in Scotland would support mixed education. Therefore, the provision of single-sex schools would deny the wishes of the majority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference was made earlier to ethnic minorities. It is the ideal of all hon. Members that we should live in a more racially harmonious society. The decision has to be made whether that goal would be best served by having separate Moslem or Hindu schools, and so on. It is legitimate sometimes to deny the right of the minority for the wider public good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should move away from the idea that the Government are on the side of choice. Their recent actions have severely denied choice. I am particularly incensed about the Government's attitude to nursery education, which has clearly been downgraded. The Minister announced last week that no national targets are to be set. That will deny the vast majority access to nursery education and a choice that they would wish to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) will not go too far down the road of nursery education. It
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0851">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>179</span>
is perfectly legitimate to allude to nursery education but not to make it a substantial point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, Mr. Knox. But choice has been denied. If one asks the vast majority in Scotland whether they think that although Denmark has more than 100 adult residential colleges—Scotland only needs one, they would say that there should be choice. On curriculum and assessment in schools, the Government have imposed national assessment, which, in particular subjects, takes away freedom from schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another crucial issue is that the overwhelming majority of people in Scotland believe that the Scottish education system is distinct, valuable and should be treasured and not judged by English criteria.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall do so after I have completed this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this debate it has constantly been argued that a prima facie case for a policy to be carried out in Scotland is the fact that it is carried out in England. That is a denial of choice. The Secretary of State must always be aware of the cultural distinctiveness of Scotland, and currently it is not being recognised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. I was trying to intervene on a point that he made some time ago rather than on the point that he is now making, which is not relevant to my intervention. He said that the provision of single-sex schools prevents parents choosing a co-educational school for their children and therefore distorts the rights of some parents. That is not so. The existence of Notre Dame and Our Lady and St. Francis as single-sex schools does not prevent other parents in Glasgow from choosing co-educational schools for their children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was saying that the exercise of choice by one group of parents has its impact upon others. Inevitably, a pattern of single-sex schools must have an impact on other factors, such as catchment areas. The inevitable concomitant of assembling viable schools which exclude the female population because they go to separate schools is to have wider catchment areas. The local authority must decide whether the benefit of single-sex schools exceeds the disadvantages of losing the neighbourhood nature of schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party has pressed for comprehensive education—comprehensive is always a relative term—on the basis that it extends choice and that allocating large numbers of pupils to junior secondary schools at a very early age means that they are denied the choice of a full range of subjects. Experience has shown that basically the comprehensive system has worked well and that any proposals to introduce the power to opt-out must be examined in the context of whether they would weaken the comprehensive education system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Professor Willms and Andrew McPherson based their research on education in Scotland. They have recently reached the conclusion that major gains have been made through comprehensive education and that inequality has been reduced, schools are more balanced
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>180</span>
and represent a wider section of the community. There has been increased access to certification and a considerable improvement in the number of pupils who have access to, and have succeeded in, state education systems. Most important is the fact that there has been a progressive equalisation of attainment between social classes, whether male or female. McPherson and Willms say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The lower the levels of selection, creaming and segregation, the lower tended to be the effects of social class on attainment. The longer established the comprehensive school, the higher tended to be the attainment."</p></blockquote>
We must decide whether the Government's proposals would damage that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has been made to the level of demand for opting-out. The Government have asked what we fear if there is no demand and argue that if there is no demand, why not let the provision through? There is no significant demand for opting-out in a normal situation. It is not an education issue discussed in any street in Scotland. As I am grateful to the Minister for lending me his copy of yesterday's edition of 	<i>The Scotsman</i> it seems ungracious to use it to quote a passage that goes against him. In that newspaper it is said that 65 per cent of the population agreed that the level of provision by education authorities was fairly good, or very good and that in contrast the education policies of central Government were regarded as good, or fairly good, by only 26 per cent of the population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When everything is going well there is no demand for opting-out, but where there are grievances the situation alters completely. I make no apologies to my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) for quoting the example of Strathclyde. All members of the Committee admit—apart from the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) who has not got the bottle to do so—that some schools must close. In that context, every threatened school is likely to vote for opting-out as part of its strategy and refer the matter to the Secretary of State. Why should they not do that? We want more accountability from councillors. I know from my intense involvement in school closures that threatened schools will adopt that strategy. The parents would vote to opt-out of the local education authority, but all those "choices" to opt-out will not be accepted. "Choice" will be exercised by the Secretary of State, according to his political authority's judgment, not according to the judgment of the local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valid point. Does he agree that the reason why opting-out has not been included in this Bill may be that the Government are waiting for Strathclyde to get school closures out of the way before they allow parents to appeal to the Secretary of State to allow them to opt-out in order to keep their school open?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course. I notice that the Government have not denied that a school that has been earmarked for closure might try to opt-out. Three schools in Strathclyde have been mentioned as possible opters-out—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>181</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman has just provoked me, I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) said that in the form of opting-out that he proposed, which has parallels with the English proposals, schools that are not able to support large numbers of pupils because parents do not send their children there would be funded on a per capita basis and therefore would not be viable or eligible for opting-out. The hon. Gentleman is correct to say that it would be difficult to close a popular and viable school if opting-out were available. It is true that a popular and successful school might choose to opt-out to get round a decision to close it. However, the hon. Gentleman should think about the position of schools that are not viable, which do not make economic sense and are not supported by parents, but which are allowed to continue while other schools are threatened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come later to the issues that the Minister has raised, and he may regret it. Viability is not clear cut. Every group of parents claims that, given certain circumstances, their school would be viable. If I understand what is happening in Tayside—I may be wrong—there has been depopulation of rural schools and those schools feel threatened. If I am wrong about that, I have no doubt that I shall be corrected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for giving way. Although I disagree with him, he is the only Opposition Member on the Committee who understands the proposals before the Committee. Could I make clear to him, and will he accept, that because of per capita funding a school that is not viable in the local authority sector would clearly not be viable if it opted-out? There may be disagreement about the precise definition of viability, but in principle the concept is clear. The only schools that could opt-out successfully are schools which are popular with parents. Per capita funding means that schools that are half full or 40 per cent full would not be able to opt-out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that viability is clear cut. Secondary schools in Scotland vary in size from about 200 to 1,500–2,200 pupils. Unless other assumptions are made, it is not clear what viability means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to look at how opting-out would affect three of the schools that have been mentioned. One such school is Neilston primary school. So far, we have talked about opting-out in the context of secondary schools, but I do not see why we should not look at primary schools as well. The Minister seems to be agreeing with me about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has said something misleading. He suggested that Neilston is one of the schools that has been referred to in the context of opting-out. I have referred to Neilston primary school during our proceedings, and in the House, because of the deplorable letters sent by Charles Gray to parents. I have not at any time suggested opting-out for Neilston primary. However, I am interested to hear the hon. Gentleman suggest that. If he wishes to develop the case, I shall listen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>182</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to do so. The next logical stage in Neilston's disagreement with the education authority is for some parents to ask, "What do we do next?" One option is to try to get away from Strathclyde region's control. Neilston is a popular school and is at capacity. The parents could apply to the Secretary of State for direct funding. Because of building in the area, the school is not large enough to accommodate all the pupils who wish to attend. More pupils cannot attend Neilston primary school because the ruling is that Barrhead primary school, which is two miles away, has surplus capacity. The Scottish Office has made it clear that when there is limited capital funding spare capacity must be used. Any Minister would put down that ruling. Resources must be used most effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What would happen if Neilston primary opted-out? It would apply to the Secretary of State. It would be disgraceful if that school received capital funding ahead of other primary schools or proposals of equal merit. That would be privileged funding by the Secretary of State, as against the local education authority. However, Neilston could have that option.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Jordanhill school has also been mentioned. It, too, raises some interesting issues. It is unique and has become an anachronism because it was a demonstration school associated with Jordanhill college. It is also unique because it is both a primary and a secondary school. That raises a further issue. Could parents set up schools that are both primary and secondary schools? The hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) seems to be urging that. That would be another exercise of choice, but we have had no statement on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another interesting fact about Jordanhill school is that the local education authority was offered the opportunity to take it over. The principal reason why it did not do so is again choice. Many councillors recognised that, by taking on Jordanhill, schools in other areas would be put increasingly under threat. The implication was that the exercise of choice by one group of parents would have damaging consequences for others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paisley grammar school has been mentioned extensively. Last Thursday, the Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shows that there is a clear correlation between schools to which parents choose to send their children under the parents' charter, which was provided by the Government, and schools that are performing well academically."—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 28 April 1988; c 147–8.]</p></blockquote>
That has been said frequently in the Committee in reference to Paisley grammar school. I decided to find out whether it is true. Does the academic attainment of Paisley grammar school justify disturbing the academic arrangements of other parts of Paisley?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paisley grammar school is unusual because around 40 per cent of those who attend it are from outside the Paisley area, largely from the constituency of the hon. Member for Eastwood. That is obviously why he is so anxious. When I was trying to find a definition of academic excellence, I asked the education authority how many pupils at the Eastwood secondary schools got A grades and how many pupils at Paisley grammar school got A grades. That seems to me to be as good
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0853">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>183</span>
an illustration of academic excellence as any. I see the hon. Member for Eastwood agreeing with me from a sedentary position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are five secondary schools in the Eastwood area: Eastwood, Mearns, St. Ninians, Williamwood and Woodfarm. At the secondary five level, Eastwood had 222 students and got 111 grade A passes, Mearns had 175 pupils and got 125 grade A passes. St. Ninians had 147 pupils and got 99 grade A passes, Williamwood had 207 pupils and got 132 grade A passes and Woodfarm had 175 pupils and got 107 passes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. When I have been through the whole list I shall be pleased to give way. I remind the Committee of the figures. There were 11, 125, 99, 132 and 107 A-grade passes. How many did Paisley grammar school get? It got 52 grade A passes. If the figures are converted into a ratio of number of pupils to grade A passes, the ratio for Eastwood would be 0.5, for Mearns it would be 0.7, for St. Ninians it would be 0.6, for Williamwood it would be 0.6, for Woodfarm it would be 0.5 and for Paisley it would be 0.29.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I have finished this analysis I shall be pleased to give way. When I asked the education authority how Paisley grammar compared with national figures, the report that I received was that Paisley grammar school performs less well than would be expected and is well below the national average in science subjects. All the Eastwood high schools are well above the national average and also perform three times better than Paisley grammar school in the critical science subjects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In normal circumstances I would not want to compare school against school. It is deeply flawed to do that in a simplistic way. But we have a magnet school that is choosing its students and being held up as an example of where the state education system should be distorted to allow opting-out. At the very least, on the figures that I have given, one could not say that the reason for that was the school's academic excellence. There must be some other reason, and it may be social cachet. Is that an adequate reason for opting-out?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An outrageous suggestion was made in this Committee last week that if Paisley grammar school remained open under Strathclyde education authority, the education authority would put in a head teacher in order to destroy the school and run it down. I can tell the hon. Member for Eastwood that, from my knowledge of that education authority, if Paisley grammar school continued the motivation would be to give that school a genuine reputation for academic excellence rather than one that does not seem to have been examined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman obviously does not know where my constituency is. He has referred to the schools in Eastwood district. None of the pupils from my constituency who go to Paisley grammar are
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>184</span>
from Eastwood district; they are all from Barrhead and Neilston.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not withdraw what I said. My point is that some schools in Eastwood district have superb educational achievements. Yet Paisley grammar school is being held up as excellent when it does not seem to compare well in terms of attainment with standards elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should withdraw his analysis because it is wrong. Leaving aside the comment about the excellence of the schools in my constituency, with which I wholly concur, he is comparing figures for Paisley grammar with schools in Eastwood district. No one from the Eastwood district part of my constituency goes to Paisley grammar school; pupils there come from the Barrhead and Neilston parts. What is the basis of his analysis?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that when the hon. Gentleman replies he will refer to "opting-out". We have had an interesting discussion, but it is a while since we heard anything about opting-out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point, Mr. Knox, but it is entirely—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman must not just take my point—he must act on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point, and will act upon it, Mr. Knox. All that I have said has been explicitly about opting-out. The Minister claims:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shows that there is a clear correlation between schools to which parents choose to send their children under the parents' charter, which was provided by the Government, and schools that are performing well academically."—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 28 April 1988; c. 14.]</p></blockquote>
I have sought to demonstrate that there are schools in the constituency of the hon. Member for Eastwood that perform very well academically. Yet there is one school to which parents from his constituency send their children but which does not perform anywhere near so well academically as those schools in Eastwood district.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The great danger with the opting-out proposals is the use of disagreements with the local education authority as reasons for opting-out. Education authorities perform the most difficult of tasks. No one wants to close schools, and no councillor wants to close schools. It is the most uniquely painful experience to be involved in shutting a school; it is then that people realise how important it is to an area. With opting-out, where closure of a school is threatened, all schools will wish to use the opting-out mechanism. A majority will wish to appeal to the Secretary of State to be taken into his funding. That will mean that the Secretary of State, with his more restrictive attitude to secondary and primary funding, will decide which schools will close, instead of the local education authority deciding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

interesting debate about opting-out. However, it is wrong to come to a decision in this debate. I hope that we shall have second thoughts about how far we go down that road today or on Thursday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must not be dogmatic about education, especially in Scotland where the situation is so different in each region. In my humble period as an education Minister I always came back to the conclusion that nothing was ever cut and dried, and nothing was ever black and white. There were sometimes good arguments for consensus politics, although Conservative members of the Committee may not approve of that. It may be the right way forward in the best interests of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a little disappointed that some Opposition Members have been so dogmatic and have not looked at all sides of the question. There must be the strongest grounds for bringing about change in education. I expected my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) to quote from the polls. After many years in politics, I realise that polls are sometimes good, sometimes bad and sometimes indifferent. I take them all with a pinch of salt. In politics nothing is ever as good or as bad as one thinks, but always somewhere nearer the middle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing a major change and a new concept in Scottish education. I would like much more thought, discussion and debate on the practicalities of opting-out under the system proposed by the Secretary of State. I see merit on all sides. Of course I believe in parental choice, but one can argue for parental choice only if it is to the benefit of the whole. Having some experience of operating the Scottish Education Department, I see that it may not be plain sailing for a school to opt-out and receive SED funding, as opposed to education authority funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the point made by the Opposition that we must consider carefully the question of capital expenditure, and financial and other priorities. We must consider the matter in great depth before we accept the simple benefits of opting-out and adopting a new system. We must look at two or three stages, five or 10 years ahead, to see whether the system would be advantageous in a Scottish context and in a Scottish regional context. We all agree that what may be a top priority in Glasgow may be entirely different in Aberdeenshire or in Dumfries and Galloway. We want to know where we are going before we take the final plunge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When my hon. Friend the Minister produced his consultation paper in the autumn I was not at all enthusiastic about the ceiling—I prefer to live closer to the floor. I was glad that after his practical consultations he returned to the simpler proposals outlined in the White Paper, which I was happy to accept. If we agreed that opting-out was not a project to be put into legislation, I would feel a little hurt, to say the least, to find such a proposal in new legislation in the next Session of Parliament. That would be moving on too rapidly. On reading the Bill in detail, I am perturbed that clauses 15 and 17 might leave a loophole for opting-out earlier than I would wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>186</span>
I accept boards as I have accepted school councils, but I have to consider the concept of opting-out in the context of what will happen to the resources and facilities in any educational authority area. We have talked about top-quality curriculum, but we must also consider other matters such as recreational facilities. Swimming pools, for instance, are immensely expensive. How will such provision tie in with schools that have opted-in and those that have opted-out? We must consider such matters in the longer term rather than merely concentrate on the decision to opt-in or out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
St. Joseph's college in Dumfries is a fine grant-aided Roman Catholic school run by the Marist Brothers. However, they felt that running a school of that magnitude and quality had nothing to do with what the Marist Brothers had originally set out to do. They were concerned mainly with missionary work overseas. The Marist Order and parents agreed that they should opt into the educational authority system so that from being a grant-aided school it would become a normal education authority secondary school. The school has been successful, and I am sure that no one regrets the decision to opt-in. Therefore, we need to consider both sides of the question of opting-in and opting-out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a major decision needs to be taken slowly. We should move by evolution, and quality must be the priority. I am glad that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State mentioned the success of Scottish musicians in the great competition shown on television at the weekend. I am glad that the girl from Dumfries received a prize. Music is just one of countless different subjects in Scottish education that are of primary importance, as is the issue of denominational schools and school closures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, I said that Scottish education has had a long period of indigestion. There has been so much change, but now is the time to consolidate. We should not make a further major change. Some of my hon. Friends will say that the decision to opt-out is voluntary. I accept that, but I am worried about the base of the pyramid and the whole structure of education. Will schools be able to stand on their own and will they be able to provide the services and facilities required? Much thought needs to be given to such matters before we take such a dramatic step.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have preferred to speak in much more depth and harmony, but I feel that Opposition Members have taken certain views long before they even heard the discussions. We should work together to decide what is best for Scottish education. That will not be achieved by both parties squabbling in Committee. We must have high ideals for Scottish education, right through tertiary education to university education. Then we shall be doing the best that we can for children presently in education in Scotland. We should look more to the future than to the next year or two. We should be looking five or 10 years ahead in setting something up, as Scottish education was set up in the 1870s and 1880s. During the past 10 or 15 years, we have jumped far too much from one side to the other without looking at the goal—which is not today, but a generation ahead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was significant that the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir. Hector Monro) preached evolution to the Committee while in earlier sittings the Minister preached revolution. The hon. Member for Dumfries is a long-standing Member of the House and of the Conservative party. He represents the old Conservative party that used to win more than 50 per cent of the vote in Scotland; the Minister represents the new breed of Conservatism in Scotland under which support for the Conservatives has plummeted to its lowest level since the second world war. That has dramatised the different contributions that those two hon. Gentlemen have made, and the Minister should take note if he wishes to remain the Minister for Scottish education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debates on the opting-out clause, especially that of Thursday morning, were noteworthy for the contradictory enthusiasms displayed by the hon. Members for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) and for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker). The hon. Member for Eastwood showed that his enthusiasm for opting-out sprang from a desire to prevent schools being closed, especially in the Strathclyde region. But the hon. Member for Tayside, North made it clear that he is keen to see schools close in the Dundee district area, because it has an effect on the schools in his constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>indicated assent.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to see that the hon. Member for Tayside, North agrees that he wants to see schools close in the Dundee district. I am sure that the voters in Thursday's elections for Dundee district council will note that local Conservative Members are calling for school closures in their city.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman understands my position correctly, but I am not sure. I wish to make it clear. I have never opposed the general proposition of school closures in Strathclyde.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes you do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I say to the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) that Notre Dame and Our Lady and St. Francis schools do not significantly affect my constituency. I am not opposed to closures in Strathclyde region. But the closure programme is being used to deprive Catholics and Moslems of a particular form of education—single-sex schools. That raises a fundamental question for central Government, not simply about school rationalisation but about the deprivation of some minorities of a form of education that they value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) dealt effectively with that point. The hon. Member for Eastwood fails to see that allowing some groups of parents to exercise choice can affect the choices available to other parents. There is obviously a debate in Strathclyde about that, but I do not come from Strathclyde and have not followed it closely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>188</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish the hon. Gentleman to be under a misapprehension. If I did not make it clear before, I shall do so now. When a council roll falls, difficult decisions will have to be made by the local authority, which will lead to school closures. School closures have happened in my constituency, and I have assisted the local authority in making them. I did not oppose any of them; I accepted that the reduction in school rolls brought them about. I expect the same to happen in Dundee as happened in my constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, I was a member of the regional council and the education committee on that council before being elected to Parliament. I am aware that there is no opposition if, because of dramatically falling school rolls, schools are no longer viable. Everyone, including parents, would agree that such schools should close. I object to a local authority closing a school when parents and others recognise that it is viable. That happened under the previous Conservative administration in Dundee. Conservative members of the council supported the closure of three viable primary schools when everyone else opposed it. The result of recent regional council elections in Tayside is a testimony to the wrongheadedness of the Conservatives in imposing school closures against the wishes of parents and others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate on the right of schools to opt-out of the maintained sector into a new grant-maintained sector under the Government is unnecessary because the hon. Member for Eastwood intends to seek to withdraw his new clause at the end of the debate. However, the debate is significant because the hon. Member for Eastwood is not merely flying a personal kite. His enthusiasm, shared by the hon. Member for Tayside, North struck a note with the Minister, who spoke for almost an hour. He enthusiastically supports the principle of opting-out. He sees it as part of his plans for Scottish education. It seems that, in future, he sees opting-out provisions being included in legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to take any notice of the weekend press, we know that the Prime Minister has announced that she intends to take a renewed interest in Scottish matters. Opting-out will be put on the agenda in Scotland as an example of her attempt to put a kilt on the so-called Thatcher revolution and to make it credible in Scotland, although it has singularly failed to be credible to date. Although opting-out is not proposed in the Bill, we must deal with the arguments now, because the Government have made it clear that opting-out will be introduced in Scottish education at a later stage of this Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish continually to refer to the good contributions made by the right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) because it will do him no good in the Conservative party to have his back slapped by Opposition Members. He is a paid-up member of the Tory party. When I appeared on television with him last Friday night, with the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce), the right honourable Gentleman made it clear that he supports the poll tax, housing benefit cuts and social security cuts, so he is not the angel that some people would have us believe. However, the right honourable Gentleman went to the heart of the matter when he
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0856">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>189</span>
insisted that we consider the impact of opting-out not on individual schools, which may decide to opt-out, but on the remainder of the education system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right honourable Gentleman said that opting-out would strike at the heart of, and fundamentally change, the comprehensive education system which we have known in Scotland for the past 15 or 20 years. Committee members must decide whether it would be good fundamentally to change the character of the comprehensive education system in Scotland, which is a relatively new system. I went to one of the first comprehensive schools in Scotland—St. Augustine's secondary school in Milton in Glasgow. My primary school teachers were shocked that someone who came top of the class should decide to go not to the selective school—St. Mungo's Academy—where entry was controlled purely on examination results, but to a comprehensive school, which in 1960 was the only one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The comprehensive system has spread since then. It only developed fully towards the end of the 1970s, with very few schools remaining outside the system. It is probably too early to pass a verdict on whether that system has been a success. However, we are indebted for the research on the effectiveness of comprehensive education, to the Centre for Education Sociology at the University of Edinburgh. My hon. Friend the Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) referred to the work of Andrew McPherson and Professor Willms who conducted a recent, detailed analysis of comprehensive reorganisation in Scotland. They worked closely with the Scottish Education Department in their analysis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many interesting facts emerged from that research. First, comprehensive education has contributed to a process of equalisation in Scotland. The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) suggested that we attempt to make everyone equal. That is not the aim of comprehensive education or of any Opposition Member. Inequality in educational attainment between different socio-economic groups in Scotland has been reduced by the introduction of comprehensive education. All Committee members should welcome that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the research shows that there has been a general improvement in the average level of attainment, in terms of obtaining school certificates. Because of the comprehensive system more pupils are staying on and gaining access to SCE and standard grade qualifications now than in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way before he pursues a red herring too far. My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) made clear when moving his new clause that he was arguing for opting-out. As in the English legislation, there will be provision to maintain the character of the school. The arguments about the merits of comprehensive education are a diversion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is right to say that there has been general improvement in performance. O-level passes have risen from 65 per cent in 1985–87 to 66 per cent. But the hon. Member for Clydebank and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>190</span>
Milngavie may care to reflect on the figures for Paisley grammar school, which have gone up from 77 per cent to 85 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am bemused by the Minister's remark that if the principle of opting-out were enshrined in legislation, there would be qualifications, as in England, to allow schools to maintain their character. What does that mean? I shall be seeking clarification on that from the Minister and from the hon. Members for Eastwood and for Tayside, North as I develop my remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To what can the success of comprehensive education be attributed? Why has it been such a success in Scotland? Those who carried out the research identified many characteristics of the comprehensive system to which that success can be attributed. For example, the researchers identified the abolition of selection at the age of 12. Abolition of selection is due to the introduction of the comprehensive system. There is no longer selection at the age of 12. All pupils have access to certificated examinations. That is reflected in the increasing numbers of pupils who get certificates now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The establishment of sixth year comprehensives in communities where the density of population permits that has lessened differences between schools and has broadened educational opportunities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman may allude to some of those points, but he cannot make them the central part of his argument. We are discussing opting-out, and although the hon. Gentleman may allude to the comprehensive system, he must not make it the major part of his argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point is that if we try to understand the success of the comprehensive system, we can gauge whether the opting-out principle endangers that success. When schools have become comprehensive, they have improved their ability to get children through examinations and have increased opportunities for children to gain certificates. Will opting-out place that in danger? Is opting-out a direct threat to the comprehensive education system in Scotland? The Committee must confront that important question this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we can answer that, we must know exactly what is intended by the principle of opting-out in Scottish education. The Minister and the hon. Member for Eastwood said that an opted-out school would be completely under the control of its board of management and outwith the control of the education authority. So schools will not simply opt-out of the state sector; they will opt-out of education authority control and influence, and will opt-in to a new, grant-maintained sector, directly under the control of the Scottish Education Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is the case, a key issue will be the admission arrangements to schools that opt-out of education authority control. For example, will they be required to admit exactly the same school population as they were required to admit under the education authority
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0857">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>191</span>
system? In other words, will the education authority's definition of catchment areas continue to apply to opted-out schools, and will opted-out schools be bound by those catchment areas? Will those who live within the catchment area of an opted-out school have a cast-iron guarantee that they can continue to attend that school after it has opted-out from the education authority?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, will opted-out schools continue to be bound by current legislation that affects schools under education authority control and obliges them to accept pupils from outside the catchment area whenever the parents of those pupils express a desire for their children to gain access to opted-out schools? Will opted-out schools, under the control of their boards of management, be obliged to accept pupils from wherever, simply because the parents ask that their children be enrolled at that school? Will those schools be able to refuse access only on the basis of insufficient accommodation? Those questions must be answered before we proceed with the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is asking a series of reasonable questions. However, does he agree that most of those problems seem to be resolved satisfactorily at Jordanhill school, where opting-out takes place in practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, Jordanhill is one school which could be accurately described as an opted-out school. We are discussing the possibility of 100 or 150 such schools in Scotland—no one knows how many there might be. What would be the impact in the catchment areas of maintained schools within the education authority area? The promoters of the clause and the amendment must deal with that question and they have not done so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has perhaps forgotten that I said that the amendments would create the necessary pressures for accountability on the local authority. The schools would then have no reason to want to opt-out. They will do so only if they are dissatisfied and if the reasons for their dissatisfaction are not dealt with. If opting-out is not a real threat because the comprehensive system is so good, I cannot see why the hon. Gentleman is making such a lengthy speech, because it will not happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member deliberately misunderstands my point, which concerns the structure of education. The comprehensive structure of education in Scotland has been a success. If dissatisfaction has arisen in Scotland it is with the funding of the comprehensive education system, which has not been adequate to meet demands. That has caused dissatisfaction among parents, pupils, teachers and local councillors alike, who all continue to lobby the Minister, the Secretary of State for Scotland and others for additional funding to make the system work properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Naturally, there is dissatisfaction, but it should not be dealt with by introducing the principle of opting-out. It is much more sensible to deal with dissatisfaction within a successful structure of education, such as
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>192</span>
comprehensive education, by funding it properly so that everyone gets a fair deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall continue with the theme that I was trying to develop before I gave way to the hon. Member for Eastwood. It is still unclear whether opted-out schools will come under the control of the education authority in terms of catchment areas and access for pupils to those schools. What would happen if the boards of opted-out schools were allowed to determine their intake, irrespective of the LEA's wishes? I want to be told that the board of an opted-out school will not be able to determine its own intake, but no Conservative Member is leaping to his feet to do so. The silence leads me to conclude that school boards in charge of opted-out schools will have the right to determine their own intake, irrespective of the LEA's wishes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is being unfair. There are no proposals for opting-out. My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood moved a new clause as a marker for the future, but said that he would withdraw it. If the hon. Gentleman is really a seeker after truth he can examine the Education Reform Bill, which applies to England. It states that opted-out schools are required to accept placing requests in the same way as schools that remain within the local authority sector. He is merely raising a series of scares and if he wishes to demolish the Government's plans for opting-out in England he should try to do so on the basis of the proposals in that Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I notice that the Minister referred to placing requests but not the education authority's definition of catchment areas and whether opted-out schools will be involved. That is perhaps because in the English Bill the proposal does not apply to opted-out schools under the control of a board of management. With respect, the Minister spoke for an hour without dealing with such issues. If he is such a supporter of the principle of opting-out, he should deal with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The Minister is dodging the issues—he is merely saying, "Look at the English Bill". We invite the Minister to say exactly what that Bill proposes. First, why is it sufficient to argue that what is in the English Bill is good enough for the Minister with responsibility for education in Scotland? Why have a separate Scottish education system? Secondly if a school is full and receives more placing requests, how will it decide which pupils to let in?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valid point. If, because of high demand, a school has to decide between one set of pupils and another, will it be able to apply selection criteria such as entrance examinations or charge fees? The Government have denied the possibility of charging fees in opted-out schools, but under existing legislation, the prohibition on fee-charging applies only to schools under the control of the education authority. As opted-out schools will not be under local authority control, it is feasible that such schools will be able to charge fees and distinguish between queues of pupils on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a case of drafting. In opening the debate, I made it clear that I had not considered the possibility of grant-maintained schools charging fees, just as there is no possibility of Jordanhill school charging fees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Jordanhill is unique within the present structure. The opted-out sector is a whole new ball game. I am conscious of the time so I shall try to draw my remarks to a close.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the questions that I raised this morning are not answered satisfactorily, we shall view the flying of this particular kite—the opting-out principle—as a determined attack on the comprehensive education system, which has never been accepted by Conservative Members. They voted against it when it was first introduced and have opposed it at every opportunity, north and south of the border. They do not believe in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>194</span>
equal access. They want privilege for an elite—albeit a large elite—if possible without paying but funded by the taxpayer. We shall continue to oppose the principle of opting-out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
