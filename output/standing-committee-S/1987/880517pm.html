	<div class='clause'>Clause 5</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>EDUCATION AUTHORITY OBVSERVERS AND HEADTEACHER</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment moved [this day],</i> No. 108, in page 4, line 35, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(6) In exercising his responsibilities in relation to the activities of the School Board the headteacher will remain accountable to the education authority in accordance with the terms of the relevant Contract of Employment.".—	<i>[Mr. Norman Hogg]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cumbernauld and Kilsyth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had more or less finished what I wished to say this morning, Mr. Knox. The intention of the new subsection is to confirm the accountability of the head teacher to the education authority, and to avoid creating conflicting responsibilities which could jeopardise that arrangement. That is the essence of our intentions. I hope that the Minister will feel persuaded to take on board what we propose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret that on this occasion I shall not be my usual helpful self to the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg), but I may be able to reassure him. As a result of the tutorial that the hon. Gentleman gave the Committee the other day, we know that the basic duty of a head teacher is to his employers, and it is to implement the authority's policies and the procedures necessary for the discharge of the authority's statutory duties. The Bill does not weaken the head teacher's contractual relationship with the authority, and it maintains a proper degree of independence from the board for the head teacher. The amendment is therefore unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We intend the head teacher to occupy a key role as the board's principal professional adviser. He will have a duty to explain clearly the authority's policies, and to help the board to evaluate its plans in the context of those policies. It would be contrary to the spirit of the Bill if a head teacher's contractual obligation were ever to reduce him to becoming a mouthpiece for the authority's directions in relation to its dealings with the board. I know that the hon. Gentleman would not want that to happen, so I can reassure him about the head teacher's relationship with the local authority. On that basis, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not my intention to press the matter further, for reasons that must be all too
	<span class='label label-info column'>370</span>
obvious. We may return to the matter at another time, but for the moment I accept the Minister's explanation. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 5 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>PROCEEDINGS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 96, in page 4, line 36, leave out "and vice-chairman".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 93, in page 4, line 39, after "chairman," insert "of the meeting".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No. 94, in page 4, line 39, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"or in his absence the vice-chairman".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendment is to ascertain why a vice-chairman is necessary. After all, a school board is a small body. We all know that many organisations have a chairman and a vice-chairman, or sometimes two vice-chairmen. The Scottish Nationalists had about 5,322 vice-chairmen at the last count, each of them in charge of a section of policy. I am not sure whether any specific number of vice-chairmen is correct, but for a small body in which everyone will work closely together the need for a vice-chairman does not strike me as obvious. Surely in the absence of the chairperson the vice-chairman could be drawn from the membership present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take you, Mr. Knox, as an example of a chairman, and, if I may say so, an extremely fine example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee has no vice-chairman. When you vacate the Chair, Mr. Knox, it is ably taken over by the right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) or occasionally by the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro). We have even seen the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) in the Chair, and very well he performed the task. In fact, perhaps there is a case for putting him on the Chairmen's Panel on the basis of his considerable experience in this Committee. The Committee does not have a vice-chairman—we merely appoint one as and when we need one. In your case, Mr. Knox, the choice is made by some mystical process of the laying on of hands and, lo and behold, someone else appears in the Chair on your behalf. These school boards will be small affairs and will not require anything so formal, and I hope that the Minister will tell us why he thinks that a vice-chairman is a good idea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to reassure the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) that if the chairman were absent from the meeting the vice-chairman would take his place. That is the function of the vice-chairman. If neither the chairman nor the vice-chairman were present, there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0956">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>371</span>
would be nothing to prevent any other member of the board from taking the chair. The distinction between the vice-chairman and another member of the committee acting as vice-chairman is that the vice-chairman could exercise the chairman's casting vote, whereas a non-chairman or non vice-chairman member in the chair could not do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth about the small size of the boards, and because of their small size we have restricted the exercise of the casting vote to avoid it passing to members of staff by default. Like me, the hon. Gentleman will probably be an expert on the use of casting votes after the results of the local authority elections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume that the hon. Gentleman tabled the amendments to discover why we made the provision. The principle of having a vice-chairman is excellent. Even the Labour party has a vice-chairman at both Scottish and national levels, as well as a deputy leader. As for smaller bodies, I assure him that the Conservative party in Scotland also has a vice-chairman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot resist those arguments, and I beg to ask leave, to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now come to amendment No. 95. The hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) is not here, but does another Committee member wish to move it? I notice that some of the hon. Members whose names appear above the amendment are present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Knox. Normally I would be willing to move the amendment, but in this instance I am not sure what the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) had in mind. I do not know whether my hon. Friends and I signed the amendment or whether our names have appeared by mistake. I queried their inclusion earlier in the day. It is possible that the hon. Member for Gordon and I tabled the same amendment. I am not making a criticism. In the circumstances, we can return to the matter if it is serious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We cannot leave it at that, Mr. Knox. The hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) is my parliamentary neighbour. Usually when he finds himself in a hole I usually leave him digging, which seems the best thing to do. However, it is disappointing that a member of the Committee should table an amendment and not be here to move it when it is called. I was interested to learn what the hon. Gentleman was seeking to achieve. I am prepared to move amendment No. 95, Mr. Knox, to give the Committee a chance to discuss it and to save the hon. Member for Gordon too much embarrassment with his constituents. Perhaps 1 shall move the amendment more coherently and ensure that the hon. Gentleman's constituent who asked for
	<span class='label label-info column'>372</span>
the amendment to be tabled will have a better job done than if the hon. Gentleman moved the amendment himself. At least I shall try.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jacques Arnold 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gravesham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) is involved in the leadership election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may be but surely the real attribute of a leader is to attend to his duties in the House of Commons. Someone who does not must raise doubt among his constituents about his fitness and his qualities for leadership. I believe that one should lead by example, and that must be by properly scrutinising a Bill and ensuring, having tabled an amendment, that it is followed through. However, Mr. Knox, I shall not digress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to move Amendment No. 95, in page 4, line 37, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"(other than the staff members)".</p></blockquote>
The Bill, as drafted, requires that in electing a chairman and vice-chairman the only eligible members for election are the parent members of a board and the co-opted members. If I have read that correctly, I want to know the reasoning behind staff members not being eligible for election as chairman or vice-chairman of a board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reasoning is difficult to understand because, as my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will know from debates on an earlier amendment, I have already questioned whether it is sensible to have a parent majority on these boards. If there is to be a parent majority, we should discuss later whether we should have more teachers on the board. Having more teachers on the board may appease me a little, and I know that my hon. Friend is considering that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It appears that my hon. Friend will maintain the parental majority on the board for reasons which he has explained. Given that we have a parental majority, it is clear that if parents so wish they will be able to appoint from among their own number. They will have the ability to outvote the teachers and the co-opted members. If my hon. Friend has written that provision into the Bill to maintain the parent initiative on the boards, it is unnecessary to provide that staff members are ineligible for election. Surely it is better to let the boards choose their chairmen and vice-chairmen from whatever grouping they like. If my hon. Friend is trying to seek parental initiative throughout the activities of the boards, surely that is already achieved through the parental majority and does not need to be underlined further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Lewis Moonie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kirkcaldy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my name is also above the amendment, I feel justified in speaking to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is an eminently reasonable proposal and I shall be interested to hear the Minister justifying why only parents or co-opted members may be the chairman or vice-chairman of a board. That is a two-faced strategem. We are talking about democratic control in schools, but the Minister is creating two separate and distinct classes of board members. That strikes me as a divisive and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0957">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>373</span>
unnecessary stipulation to make in the structure of the boards. Parents will have a majority and so their views are likely to prevail. The staff members will be elected—as will the parents; they will be responsible and will have an interest in ensuring that the board functions properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Often, staff members may have greater experience of handling difficult situations. It is therefore odd that they should be excluded from acting as chair or vice-chair of the board. I leave the matter there and await with interest the Minister's reply before I comment further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is one occasion when the right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) took the very words out of the mouth of my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg). Albeit circuitous, my hon. Friend was coming round in his own way—perhaps slow, but a good and fashionable approach—to say that we would move the amendment, which is an important one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Knox. I am sorry to interrupt the proceedings. Here we are, searching for a lost leader, it seems that the hon. Member for Gordon is addressing the House on new clause 1 during the debate on the British Steel Bill. What can be done about that? Can we sent for the Serjeant at Arms to bring up the hon. Gentleman, Mr. Knox?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member no doubt appreciates that that is not a matter for the Chair. The hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) must choose his own priorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Knox. As someone who is relatively inexperienced in such matters, may I ask whether the Monitor exists—individuals on the other side of the Gangway do not officially exist—and whether we are entitled to take note of what appears on its screen?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure. For the sake of argument, I think that we can say that it does exist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was discussing the amendment's proposal to delete the reference in clause 6(1) to 	<br><blockquote><p>"(other than the staff members)".</p></blockquote>
The issue is important. The Minister made several remarks about the board—not least, that individuals can be appointed to it, not have children at school for a few years thereafter, and still contribute because they have something to offer. Following that line of argument, if staff members—in small numbers—are elected to the board, surely it should be open to them to be elected as chairman or vice-chairman because they can bring certain qualities to that office. To eliminate the possibility of their occupying such a position is anti-democratic. How can the Minister justify discriminating against staff members in that way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>374</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to what was said by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. It would be unwise to appoint a staff member to such a key position—I see that the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) is mouthing a question. It would be unwise to do so because the board would determine attitudes within the school. In some circumstances, therefore, it would be difficult for a staff member also to be the chairman. The best example is that of the sad happenings in co-operative societies throughout the country. A chap from the butcher's department might be chairman, and that might be the least effective way of running anything. It is a fact of life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By and large, the articles of co-operative societies specifically exclude staff members from taking up such a position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman assists me with my argument. I rest my case there and thank him very much.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not intend to speak, but then I heard the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker). I shared the privilege of serving on the Committee proceedings of the Housing (Scotland) Bill with the hon. Gentleman when he diverted the Committee for many hours on the berry pickers in Blairgowrie; now he speaks of butchers in co-operatives. The hon. Gentleman said that it would be unwise for school boards to decide whom they wished to have as their chairman. That illustrates the hon. Gentleman's arrogance. If the Minister is serious about the Bill giving parents power to run the school boards as they wish, it should be left to the parental majority to decide whether it wishes a parent to be chairman or vice-chairman. Also, if a staff member has a statutory right to represent the interests of the staff, he should have the same right as any other member to hold any office if the board decides to elect him. The Minister must produce an ingenious argument to explain why staff members should not be allowed to serve if they so desire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to come up with an ingenious argument that satisfies the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion). I begin by saying to the hon. Member for Dumbarton, (Mr. McFall) that the chairs will be things that are sat upon. The Bill refers to chairmen and vice-chairmen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have discussed at length the role of the head teacher and how it is proper for him to be an independent adviser to the board. I was able to assure the Committee that the head teachers' associations were content with the head teacher's status as a non-voting, non-member of the board who is there as principal adviser. If staff members could be elected as chairmen of boards, this would alter the head teacher's position dramatically. If I were inclined to accept the amendment, the position of the head teacher would be for debate. I am unable to accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall try out this argument on the hon. Member for Dundee, East. We have excluded teacher-members of the boards from being chairman
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0958">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>375</span>
or vice-chairman because under schedule 2 the boards will be involved in the appointment of senior staff. As is the rule and pattern in teachers' appointments—in local government especially, but also eslewhere—it would be inappropriate for members of staff of a school to be involved in the appointment of other members of staff. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman accepts that. It would be absurd to appoint a chairman or vice-chairman who would be excluded from involvement in the appointments of senior members of staff in a school. That is what would happen if we allowed members of staff to hold the offices of chairman or vice-chairman. It is because of that inconsistency we have excluded staff members from these offices.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested to hear the Minister say that it was the power of school boards over appointments to senior staff positions that led the Government to exclude teachers from any possibility of holding the chairmanship or vice-chairmanship of the school board. The power of the school board is clear. Surely it is to nominate one of its number to an appointments committee that will appoint senior staff to the school. It is possible for it to nominate someone who is neither chairman nor vice-chairman. There is no necessity for a teacher taking either position to be a member of a staff appointments committee. The board could come to another arrangement and appoint another parent-member to represent it on the appointments committee. This is no reason for denying two staff members the right to sit as vice-chairman or chairman if the board wishes that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dundee, East has expressed his point of view. I take the view that it would be absurd if the chairman of the board were prevented from being involved in senior appointments—the appointment of a head teacher, an assistant head or a deputy teacher—by virtue of being a member of staff, in the sense that it is appropriate that as a member of staff he should not be involved in appointments. It would be inappropriate, of course, if the board's chairman should not be involved in such appointments. The hon. Gentleman is correct to say that it is a matter for the board to decide who is nominated as a member of an appointments committee, but because of the serious nature of the functions involved in making senior appointments we would expect senior officers of the board to be available for that purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As well as telling us that the Government are dictating to school boards who should be appointed as their chairmen and vice-chairmen, the Minister is saying that the Government should dictate to school boards who they should nominate to represent the boards on appointment committees for senior staff. I imagine that it has to be chairmen or vice-chairmen, otherwise the Minister's argument does not stand. The hon. Gentleman said that it would be inappropriate to choose an ordinary parent member of the board. What he really meant is that he is insisting that it be
	<span class='label label-info column'>376</span>
either the chairman or the vice-chairman. That is his justification for not allowing staff members to hold those posts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr, Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Another interesting point occurs to me. What about the position of a parent who happens to be a teacher at another school and who is therefore eligible for election as a parent member and, for that reason, eligible to serve as chairman or vice-chairman? As the Bill is drafted, a teacher who was employed by the education authority could be able to influence such an appointment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is correct. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to table an amendment on Report, we shall consider it. I am content with the provision being available. I made a point of using the phrase "a teacher at a school where an appointment was being made". We are discussing teacher-members of the board, and for obvious reasons a parent who was a teacher at another school would be there as a parent-member, not as a teacher-member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we are operating in the dark as to what motives inspired the hon. Member for Gordon to table the amendment, can my hon. Friend say whether he has received representations from teachers' organisations or head teachers' organisations? That might help the Committee to reach a conclusion on this subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely my right honourable Friend and others will reach a view on the strength of the argument's merits rather than on the source from which it comes. Originally, the Scottish Parent-Teacher Council argued that the chairman of the board should always be a parent. The latest briefing paper makes no mention of a requirement for the chairman always to be a parent. I take that to mean acceptance of the principle that we originally enunciated. There have therefore been representations that supported the line taken in the Bill. I am not aware of any representations that support the amendment although the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, which submitted a number of amendments, has always recognised that parents had a major interest in the boards. Amendment No. 95 has not come from that quarter, and I anticipate the Head Teachers' Association of Scotland being strongly opposed to it.

The hon. Member for Dundee, East has latched on to the appointments issue and conveniently ignored the other half of the argument, which is the undesirable position of a head teacher who found that the chairman of a board was a member of his staff.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in what my hon. Friend has said but a little disappointed that he chides me for asking about the representations that he has received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When my hon. Friend spoke about a head teacher being in attendance and not being a voting member of the board he called in aid the view of the professional

	<span class='label label-info column'>377</span>
organisation representing head teachers. Knowing my hon. Friend's logicality and consistency of view on so many issues, surely he would not consider it unreasonable of me to ask about the opinions of the professional organisations representing the generality of teachers. Equally, I should be interested to know if they have not expressed any views. I do not know whether my hon. Friend has any further information on this issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can help my right honourable Friend. I understand that in a press release the Education Institute of Scotland expressed views that appear to support the amendment of the hon. Member for Gordon. Rather surprisingly, the EIS has not tabled amendments, but no doubt the hon. Member for Gordon read its press release and immediately rushed to the Table Office to table an amendment that reflected the interest that the EIS had shown.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Member agree that his right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside seems unwilling to grasp the fact that the amendment was inspired by the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) showed remarkably good judgment in wanting to pass to the next amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for responding to my speech in that double intervention. I was interested in his arguments. I understand their merit, but they are not all that ingenious. What persuades me is the suspicion that the hon. Member for Gordon rushed off to table the amendment without reflecting on it or giving the Committee the benefit of his views. That is not a solid basis on which to press an amendment. To rush off and do things in a hurry without contemplation and without being prepared to follow them through is the way to make bad law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I rose spontaneously at the last minute to help my parliamentary neighbour—I am always performing neighbourly acts to ensure that his amendments do not go without an answer. His amendment has now been answered although I am working in the dark with it, which is not unusual when dealing with Liberals. If other members of the Committee are in the same position, they will agree that it is sensible of me to say that I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 151, in page 4, line 40, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"except where the matter which is the subject of the vote relates to the co-option of a member of the Board or to the appointment of a member of the Board to any particular office or committee, in which cases the decision shall be by lot".</p></blockquote>
I am delighted to say that the amendment was tabled by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. I cannot explain why, but sometimes our briefing papers are extremely helpful
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>378</span>
The amendment would insert after the words "casting vote" the following condition:
	<br><blockquote><p>"except where the matter which is the subject of the vote relates to the co-option of a member of the Board or to the appointment of a member of the Board to any particular office or committee, in which cases the decision shall be by lot".</p></blockquote>
I am not happy about the term "by lot". The Minister and I have a vested interest in lots, although my problem has been solved and his has yet to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is derived from paragraph 5(2) of schedule 7 to the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which provides the principle of determination by lot to avoid placing appointment to office in the potential gift of the chairman of a meeting. The same principle would seem to be desirable for school boards, especially in view of their composition and the importance that must attach to the co-option of members. It is as simple as that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had considerable experience of lots. They are difficult, especially for local authorities where the differences between political parties are clear. When an election has been fought and the outcome is a stalemate, there are various ways in which the matter can be resolved. For example, in Cumbernauld and Kilsyth we totted up the votes and came to the conclusion that labour had won the election because it had 51.2 per cent. We reminded the Scottish Nationalists that they were committed to proportional representation and that, in the circumstances, they should have conceded the election to the Labour party. Strangely, they did not seem so committed to their policy on that occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot introduce anything like that into a school board. We have already rejected proportional representation. The Minister looks mystified, but we had a discussion about that. You, Mr. Knox, will recall that, even if the Minister does not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I recall, we rejected making proportional representation mandatory for the elections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always against compulsion, so I can understand the Minister's argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle of lots will have to be introduced so that a clean-cut decision can be reached. That idea has already been conceded in the statute for local government. School boards are to be a part of local government—an extension of it. We should therefore try to maintain consistency in our approach to local government. I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dundee, East made great play of the possibility of boards becoming politicised, yet the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth proposes a provision that could introduce an element of the style that exists in local government. I am not wildly enthusiastic about decisions being made by lot. The hon. Gentleman had the lots drawn of the cards cut in his constituency and his party was successful. I am not sure whether, statistically, that makes a difference to our chances of being successful in

Stirling. I suspect not, but common sense suggests that it might.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise the words of the amendment, which come from paragraph 5 of schedule 7—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, I was distracted when the hon. Gentleman said that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lots are appropriate for local government, where political decision making takes place and issues are regularly decided on the basis of votes. I am not sure whether lots are appropriate for bodies such as school boards, which are small local operating bodies operation most of their business without contention and the need for votes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with that, but does that not strengthen the argument for using lots rather than a casting vote in the event of a tie? A small number of people are involved and to have to use a casting vote in such circumstances could well put the chairman or vice-chairman in an invidious position. I strongly urge the Minister to reconsider the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened to and thought about the arguments. I recognise the merits of the case put forward by the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth. I shall gladly re-examine the matter before Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is getting to the point where I begin to feel a trifle unwell. In the circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 91, in page 4, line 42, leave out "one third" and insert "one quarter".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a probing amendment. I simply wish to find out why the Minister chose one third instead of one quarter, one half or whatever. I realise that we are dealing with a small body, but I am not certain that sub-committees are such a good idea. Nevertheless, I shall be interested to hear why the Minister's decided that one third would be appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed that the hon. Gentleman does not think that sub-committees are a good idea. They enable boards to involve local interests that may not be represented by a board's membership. They are also the means by which we deal with community and special schools. They have a role to play although, like the hon. Gentleman, I should not wish them to proliferate on a great scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman put forward a persuasive case on the previous amendment. No doubt, therefore, he will be immediately persuaded about the one third limit when I tell him that it arises from the provisions in the 1973 Act dealing with membership of local authority committees. On that basis, I hope that he will be persuaded to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>380</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret to say that the more one reads some of the clauses, the more interesting they become. As this is a probing amendment, perhaps the Minister will forgive me if I probe a little further. Clearly, the sub-committees will have to arrive at recommendations. Will those who are co-opted on to them serve as full members with the right to take part in the collective decision about what recommendation will be made to the board? Will they have a vote in that matter? The clause does not specify that as it might be worth examining that aspect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that there is a problem. The sub-committees cannot take decisions, they can only make recommendations to the board, which retains the decision-making power. In the main, sub-committees would be established to provide the board with specialist advice and guidance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In reaching a decision on what advice to give to the board, there may well be two strands of opinion in the sub-committee. In those circumstances, will the co-opted members be entitled to vote? Clearly if there is a difference of opinion a vote will have to be taken to decide the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asked whether a vote would be taken. I should expect any division of opinion in the sub-committee to be reported to the board, which would no doubt take account of the balance of arguments. Sub-committees do not have to be Soviets and reach a unanimity of view that becomes the line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 6(3) the board establishes the procedure for sub-committees. The provision states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Board may regulate the meetings and proceedings (including the quorum) of such committees."</p></blockquote>
I suppose that if the board felt it appropriate for its sub-committees to have a voting pattern it could provide one, but I do not envisage sub-committees being that type of body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having listened carefully to the minister, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 152, in page 4, line 45, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"provided that a person who is disqualified under this Act from being elected or co-opted or being a member of a School Board shall be disqualified from being a member of a committee of that Board".</p></blockquote>
The amendment is essential to stop persons who are prevented by law from serving on a board, none the less having direct involvement in its decision-making process. The amendment would prevent circumvention of the legislative intent and is derived from section 59(1) of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which makes similar provision for the committees of local authorities. It would be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0961">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>381</span>
inappropriate for the boards to be placed in a different position from that of the education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We seem to be pursuing certain criteria. The Minister has agreed to consider amendment No. 151 and I have conceded amendment No. 91. On the same criteria, I ask the Minister to accept amendment No. 152.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am strongly tempted to take the advice of the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth. He intended to be helpful and I was almost persuaded to accept the amendment, but now that I have thought about it I realise that there are reasons why it would not be right to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is undoubtedly correct to apply the general condition on disqualification from membership of school boards, which could have a range of executive functions, but I am not persuaded that similar provisions are necessary for sub-committees. They will not have decision-making powers and specific concerns, and the board can easily change their membership if any member proves deficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important consideration is for the board to select the people best placed to advise on matters being considered by the sub-committee. For example, an undischarged bankrupt may be an inappropriate choice for membership of a sub-committee dealing with finances, but if he has a handicapped child he may be a reasonable person to serve on a sub-committee on special needs provision within the school. The arguments are finely balanced, but my instinct is to leave the matter to the board rather than to be prescriptive. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be persuaded to withdraw the amendment on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 92, in page 5, line 1, leave out

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments were tabled by me as an individual, but they have subsequently appeared as COSLA amendments in the sense that that body apparently takes the same view as I do—which, one way or another, is very convenient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the only provision regulating the ordinary business administration of a school board. As such it appears to COSLA, as it does to me, to be quite inadequate. It does not afford powers or duties in the conduct of the board's ordinary affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Comparison with section 189 to 200 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 is somewhat enlightening and it must be borne in mind that the general provisions contained in those sections apply to the education authorities presently charged with the duties that the boards are to undertake. Consideration should be given to the application of
	<span class='label label-info column'>382</span>
those sections to the boards because a whole series of matters will be irrelevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The relative provisions of the 1973 Act are legal proceedings, service of legal proceedings, notices on local authorities, claims in sequestrations and liquidations, service of notice by local authorities, authentication of documents, execution of deeds by local authorities and use of seal, public notices, minsnomers and so on not to affect validity of notices and so on, inspection and deposit of documents, photographic copies of documents, reports and returns, and records. Put into plain English, that it is not something for just anyone to do. The provision in the Act is that the school board may empower any of its members, or its clerk, to execute documetns on its behalf. My hon. Friends and I are unhappy about that because, at the end of the day, these are statutory bodies, to use the phrase originally used in Committee by the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Munro). That early point made in our proceedings has weighed heavily with me since.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I envisage the school board behaving rather informally in practice, it is a statutory body and it cannot just have anybody doing things on its behalf. It is not a job for members of the board to execute documents that are highly contentious or legal. That must be done by a competent officer in authority. I have said before that a clerk should be appointed to serve several boards. I am not suggesting that there should be a full-time post for a clerk to one board. I have in mind an officer of the authority who will undertake to be the clerk to a large number of boards. He will be a responsible person who understands the implications of the job. To hand that job to parents, teachers or someone else is not the best way to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I have explained the COSLA case badly, I believe that it is saying that this is a job not for an amateur, but for someone who is ultimately accountable through the board to the authority. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will accept amendment No. 123.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that there is a little muddled thinking and that we need to distinguish between taking a decision and executing a decision. The Bill provides that, once a decision has been taken, a board may appoint an individual to sign every document that is needed to implement it. Otherwise, all members of the board would be required to sign it. The effect of the argument of the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth is that if the board wished to order stationery from the local wholesaler, all the members would have to troop down to the shop and sign on the dotted line. That is not a practical or sensible suggestion, whereas the provisions in the Bill enable them to appoint one of their number or a clerk to do that on their behalf. I do not see any difficulty arising from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The board could be involved in matters that went beyond the simple purchase of stationery. The full panoply of advice and expertise that exists in every local authority would be available to the board, as agents of the authority. For day-to-day functions, that would not be appropriate. The board requires
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0962">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>383</span>
the power to appoint someone to act on its behalf, once a decision has been taken. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are suggesting a more prescriptive procedure for the taking of minutes and the recording of the proceedings of the board. There is nothing unusual or difficult in our proposal. The new subsection 7(a) that we suggest follows the recognised procedure so that the minutes will be correctly drawn up and signed at the next meeting, following agreement by the committee that they constitute a correct record. The minutes will therefore be admissible as proof of what went on during that meeting. It is reasonable that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the names of Members present at a meeting of a School Board shall be recorded"</p></blockquote>
and that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the minutes of the proceedings of a School Board shall be made available for inspection … on request".</p></blockquote>
Amendment Nos. 115 and 116 tie in closely. If copies of the minutes were available for inspection on the premises, parents could have appropriate access to them. That would aid accountability of the board to the parents and is surely in keeping with the Minister's wishes. The amendments are therefore worthy of his agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>384</span>
Amendment No. 154 ties in with a comment by the Law Society of Scotland, which said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This sub-clause gives to the Secretary of State the power, by regulation, to require School Boards to make available documents relating to their proceedings. We believe that the regulations which are to be drafted under this sub-clause must take account of potential situations where confidentiality of information may be an issue. It is also important that provision by regulation should ensure that the access of parents and others to information should not be less than that provided by the Access to Information Act 1987."</p></blockquote>
That is an entirely reasonable comment and I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say on the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 154 specifies that
	<br><blockquote><p>"sections 50A to 50K and Schedule 7A to the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 (access to meetings and documents) shall apply to the proceedings of a School Board and its committees as to a local authority.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment is reasonable. It does not seek to destroy any function of the Bill. It recognises that school boards are likely to be with us for a considerable time. We seek to ensure that the difficult process of the past few years of persuading local authorities to become more open and accountable bears fruit. I admit freely that the Labour party has experienced difficulty in pursuing this course and that it is not a problem that is confined to other parties. There is a natural tendency towards undue secrecy in all Governments, and this is to be condemned. Governments should be open, and school boards, being governments in a small way, perhaps have more reason to be open than other groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 98 and 97 seek merely to strengthen the provision for public access to the boards' proceedings and to the records. I strongly recommend the amendments to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sympathetic to the intention that underlies the amendments. We intend that as much as possible the discussions and papers of boards be open to public scrutiny. As the notes on clauses show, we intend to use the regulation-making power in subsection (8) in that way. The presumption will greatly favour openness. In the usual way, there will be consultation about the content of the regulations before they are introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The requirement to maximise openness has to be balanced, and it will not be possible for all board business to be conducted publicly. I am thinking of staffing issues, for example. Amendments Nos. 97 and 98 are unacceptable because they would remove our ability to protect the confidential information that is discussed at meetings. We could have incorporated into the Bill a specification of what was and what was not to be in the public domain but we felt that it was more approprite to do this through regulations.

The only reference in the Bill to board minutes is in clause 6(7). However, the reference to board documents in subsection (8) includes the minutes of board meetings, therefore, in the regulations we shall provide for access to board minutes. As with access to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0963">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>385</span>
meetings, we intend to ensure the maximum possible amount of openness. Amendment No. 115 is unnecessary. We want board minutes to be as open as possible. The reason authority access is provided for in the Bill is that there will be no matters of confidentiality between the board and the authority. All that should reassure the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy. Most confidential information that comes to the board will come from the authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Bill allows education authorities to request sight of board minutes at any reasonable time, I have no fundamental objection to amendment No. 116, which seeks to require boards to make available to their authorities copies of all their minutes. The purpose of the original provisions was to save vast quantities of paper moving around that might not be of great interest to the authority. We are concerned for trees and the environment and we wish to reduce the demand for paper, but if the Opposition wish to press the amendment I shall not stand in their way. if they do so, it be on their conscience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could not accept amendment No. 153, which would import too much cumbersome detail into the Bill. Those provisions can be covered in the board standing orders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On amendments Nos. 153, 98 and 97, the Minister appears to say that the regulations to be published will given guidance to school boards on what can and cannot be in the public domain and also on the form in which meetings should be recorded and the procedures that should be adopted. If that is so, there is little disagreement between us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish that I could have expressed it as succinctly as the hon. Gentleman. That is exactly what I meant. There will be plenty of scope for offering guidance to the boards both through material and through the training process. Therefore, I hope that the Opposition can be persuaded to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumfries)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I correct to say that, as the Bill is drafted, there is nothing to prevent the school board from inviting the press to any part of a meeting, if so wished?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Provided that the board is not dealing with matters that are confidential to the local authority and that such confidentiality will not be breached, that is perfectly correct. Indeed, we should wish to encourage the boards to do that. We want the meetings to be open and to be a focus of interest in the community. The difference between us on the amendments is that we should prefer to move on the basis of regulations, which would provide flexibility, rather than writing further provisions into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the Minister, as I did to the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) who raised an important point that touches on an earlier discussion about a local authority representative being on a board. Careful guidance must be given to school boards, especially in the early stages, to ensure that they comply with issues of
	<span class='label label-info column'>386</span>
confidentiality, of which they may be unaware. However, I accept the spirit in which the Minister's remarks were made and therefore I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 8, in page 5, line 19, leave out "A School Board", and insert "The Education Authority".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This important amendment is somewhat similar to those moved this afternoon, except in clarity and quality of draftsmanship where it is outstanding and is therefore likely to be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to highlight the difference between having paid clerks, provided by the authority and volunteers who might or might not be members of the board—I should hope that they would not be. We should remember that the board is a statutory body and not just any old club or association. Its meetings must be conducted according to rules of order and carefully minuted; and subsequently the proceedings must go to the authority or for further action which the board may have the power to take. In the long run, I should be surprised if clerks did not require training for the task.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with large schools which, in effect, are large organisations. The responsibilities of a company secretary are not so far removed from those of a secretary to the board of a school with 1,500 or 2,000 pupils. Presumably he or she would be a fairly high-flying operator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the boards would be glad to have a clerk supplied and paid for by the education authority. He might be an itinerant clerk looking after one, two or three boards—perhaps more if they were small local school boards. Moreover, it struck me this morning that a whole-time education authority clerk working for the board could be one of the two members whom this morning we were anxious to see present in an ex officio capacity—one from the authority and the regional councillor, whom we think is an essential addition to the board in his own right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are several arguments in favour of the education authority supplying the clerk to the board. Such an arrangement would be financially and administratively advantageous and would help to remove the difficulty of how to have two representatives other than board members—one from the authority and the regional councillor. I have thrown in the important issue of training because this is not a job for someone with no experience of running a board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is much more than a probing amendment. It is a proposal that the Minister might well accept. He could at least take it away, consider it and bring back a favourable amendment on Report. There is a great deal of merit in my amendment, over and above its drafting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was tempted to wait until the next group of amendments before speaking because of their remarkable similarity to this amendment, but I shall briefly reinforce the comments of the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0964">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>387</span>
This is a key appointment. I do not like to keep harking back, but the issues of confidentiality, mental incapacity and many other subjects that we have discussed today show clearly that board will rely heavily on someone for advice on procedure, most of which will be unfamiliar to them. The technical procedures covered by the last group of amendments provide an excellent example of just how difficult the procedure will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are important boards and we should treat them with due respect by recognising the quality of person needed to support them. By a clerk we do not mean someone on a youth training scheme or a lower clerical officer but an administrative officer of at least medium grade in an education department, competent to produce a minute from the often tortuous discussions at board meetings and to discharge the other functions mentioned. I do not expect a full-time clerk to service one school and it will be in order for him to cover several.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society's comments lend weight to this amendment and to the next amendment. The society's says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In our view the regulations to be drafted by the Secretary of State must make provision for the remuneration of the Clerk. The extent of input required from each Clerk will vary, according to the size of the school in respect of which the School Board operated and it is important that some definite provision should be made for the source of funding and for salary scales. It may not be realistic to leave determination of salary at the discretion of the School Board itself as this might have implications for the education authority out of whose budget the salary was required to be paid."</p></blockquote>
That sums up the position nicely. I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments on the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro) has to say and I understand his concern that the clerk should be someone appropriate for the status of the board. However, I am not persuaded that the simple act of making the appointment the responsibility of the board, will in itself achieve that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The boards have a clear interest in having a clerk who is appropriate to the task and with the necessary skills. It was significant that the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) assumed that it would have to be someone employed by the education authority, perhaps servicing several boards. It could equally be a retired bank manager, a retired accountant or a retired senior administrator in the local community who had the time and the necessary skills and experience to help the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Bill is drafted, it provided for the boards to choose such people and, while not employing them, to remunerate them on the basis of a direct service contract. I understand why the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy wishes it otherwise. He would like it to be automatic for that person to be employed by the local authority under its terms and conditions. However, there is an opportunity here for flexibility which would save money in some circumstances. My hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries was concerned about that. At the same time, it may provide for a
	<span class='label label-info column'>388</span>
different type of expertise, available in the community, to come to the boards which would not be available on the basis of local authority support. That is not to say that I am in any way hostile to local authorities providing support for the school boards in terms of clerks' services or, indeed, of clerks being employees of the local authority. Far from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill provides for the school boards to take their choice. If the local authority offers a good deal, no doubt they will accept it. However, we should recognise that because they are serious bodies with real responsibilities it is important for them to be treated as such. If the boards are to have powers available to them, it is running against the grain to argue that they should not be charged with the responsibility of appointing the clerk when they are charged with, the responsibility of approving the headmaster's plans for expenditure on books and equipment, for example, in the school. We wish them to be responsible bodies and, as such, we should not shirk from giving them responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I understand the thinking behind my hon. Friend's amendment, I do not see why we should accept it. Its effect would be to reduce the choice and freedom of boards to make sensible local decisions. I would regret that and I hope that my hon. Friend will be inclined to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In some respects, I view with some disbelief the Minister's comments. On the one hand he suggests that the boards will be serious bodies carrying out a valuable role in the community and in schools and, on the other, he wishes to have extravagant voluntarism where a board can take a bank manager or a general—the recent precedent set by the health board in Fife is interesting because it has just recruited a retired colonel in West Berlin to become the new general manager of the hospital services in the region. But I digress, Mr. Knox.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must dwell for a few minutes on the clerking of the boards because those of us who have been in local government and in education know that the clerking of boards is an extremely important task and we do not want to get that out of perspective in relation to the Bill. That smacks of two things. First, if the Minister wills the end he must also will the means. Clearly, in his response to the hon. Member for Dumfries the Minister has not done that. Secondly, and equally important, a serious body cannot be run on the basis of asking someone to volunteer to undertake such a task because the question will arise of what happens if, within that limited group of parents, there is no retired bank-manager or those other worthies about whom the Minister talked. In many respects, it is nonsense to suggest that after the elaborate discussions that were involved in setting up the boards we then come to the key position of clerking to the board only to find that the Minister's interest and enthusiasm suddenly wanes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have ended with an unprofessional response from the Minister to a serious amendment. Will the Minister reconsider his approach? We are not arguing now about negotiated rates of pay, involving the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0965">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>389</span>
national joint councils. We see something serious emerging and we should consider the implications of not having someone in post who can undertake responsibly all the tasks that would fall to him or her in this context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must conclude that the Minister made that response tongue in cheek because no serious person could accept such a poor response to the hon. Member for Dumfries, who made such a worthy contribution in speaking to the amendment. Frankly, the Minister's response was inappropriate and he must think through the implications of his words. It is nice to sit in Committee and think that when the school boards are established from the north to the south of Scotland they will all meet and someone will volunteer to do this and that. It will not happen like that. Our role in Parliament is to ensure that we think through the implications of Government decisions. This is a bad decision and I hope that some concessions will be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Munro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his response. I shall make two comments. Now that the Minister has proved to me that I was 100 per cent, wrong and that school boards can be run inexpensively, I am not so worried about costs. I am now confident that we shall have well-paid professional staff looking after the boards. After all, they are not running the local flower show, a carpet bowling club or a pigeon flying club, but a board that will be responsible for people's careers—not only the pupils but the staff—at the school. Therefore, we cannot penny-pinch on professional secretarial experience in the renowned position of clerk to a board, as it is called in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should think again about my recommendation in the amendment that the professional services of the education authority should be available by providing a clerk to the board who will have procedural experience at his fingertips.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want school boards to be a success. Therefore, I want professional rules of order and general understanding of procedures and the subsequent translation of a decision into action whether by the school board or through the education authority. That may be all right for a small village school, but I cannot see this operating satisfactorily when there are 500, 1,000, 1,500 or 2,000 pupils. It will be a highly professional job to run such boards. Therefore, I shall ask the Minister at least to take away the amendment, think again about the professional advice available to the school boards and return to the issue on Report. That advice would be best provided by the education authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have liked to be able to give my hon. Friend such an undertaking. I have been flexible in trying to acknowledge arguments and to meet the Committee's wishes when possible. But this issue is fundamental. Clause 15 provides for boards to take substantial delegated powers—including financial delegation—from the local authorities. The clerk of the board might be a most responsible person—he might even be described as a bursar in those circumstances. Whether the local authority can provide—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>390</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How public school! There will be matrons next.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that there will be matrons next. At a fringe meeting at party conference when I said, "Bring back matron" the roof echoed to the cheers. Matrons are not as unpopular as the hon. Gentleman might think—nor for that matter are bursars in education. It is important for school boards to retain flexibility about whom they appoint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not certain that I completely understand the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries. He said that the boards are important—as undoubtedly they are—and that it is appropriate for the local authority to appoint the clerk. If they are important,—as, I dare say, is the committee which runs the Royal and Ancient golf club and many other organisations—it is appropriate for the boards to have the power to appoint those whom they consider are the best to enable them to discharge their functions. As my hon. friend the Member for Dumfries pointed out, the clerk is a key person. I have no doubt that, in the competitive circumstances which the Bill as drafted will create, the local authority will have on offer a variety of services to the boards; the boards will decide whether the required experience, expertise and support can be obtained from the local authority or by some other means.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No doubt the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State has seen the glowing tributes paid to him by the Secretary of State for Scotland in an article in 	<i>The Independent</i> on Saturday 14 May. the article states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Rifkind described Forsyth as 'a vital source of ideas, of radical thought.'"</p></blockquote>
Would the Minister like to take those obvious qualities and apply them to this little problem—which, in effect, the hon. Member for Dumfries highlighted? The crux of the issue is "Who pays?" For example, the local authority in Fife has approximately 200 schools—so there may be 200 boards. The essential problem is that if the Bill is enacted as drafted, voluntarism will prevail. We seek two commitments. The first is that the matter will be treated professionally, with clerking being administered by the education authority. Secondly, if the provision is included in the legislation, there will be an onus on the Government to pay the bills through the rate support grant. That is the essential problem—perhaps the Minister is deliberately ducking it. But that is the key question. If it is voluntarism, it is on the nod; if it is professional clerking, it must be paid for. If that is written into the Bill, there will be an onus on the Government to provide the cash.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall accept your judgment, Mr. Knox, because obviously you listen intently to all our contributions. But I did not say "dogmatism". I appreciate that the Minister has been in a quasi-cordial mood, in the sense of giving some concession today. I did not wish to upset that so I did not use the word "dogmatism"—I said "voluntarism".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is an ingenious way of trying to involve the Chair in an argument in Committee, but I shall not fall for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman did not use the phrase "dogmatism" perhaps he could remind me what phrase he used to describe my position—That the board should be free to appoint the clerk of its choice? Perhaps I assumed that he used it because he says it so often.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman sought to argue that as of right the clerk should be appointed by the local authority. He went much further than my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries and said that the clerk should be an employee of the local authority. It seems to me that such a suggestion is dogmatic and would limit the board's freedom unacceptably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also said that it would be appropriate for clerks to be paid. Clerks can be paid, irrespective of whether they are appointed by the local authority, as my hon. Friend's amendment seeks, or whether they are appointed by the board, as the Bill provides. The only exception is where the clerk appointed by the board is also a member of the board. Such an appointment may seem introspective or undesirable, but it may be an appropriate way forward in some remote communities of Scotland, where the prospect of a local authority person having to journey a considerable distance on a wet or snowy night raises practical difficulties that I have not discussed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was intrigued by the Minister's reference to the Royal and Ancient golf club, which appoints a secretary to discharge its duties as well as possible. He will have a hefty salary, as befits the secretary of the club, because it wants a professional approach to its outfit. The post gives the club professionalism and credibility. If school boards are to have similar professionalism and credibility the clerk's duties cannot be left to the good will of individuals. There must be some professional input. The appointment of a clerk is essential. It should be written into the Bill and local authorities should be recompensed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can help the hon. Gentleman. Such a provision is written into the Bill and is what we are discussing. Subsection (9) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A School Board shall appoint a person to be Clerk to the Board who may, unless he is a member of the Board, be paid for his services."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>392</span>
It is a matter for the judgment of the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thank goodness, there are still people prepared and able to carry out the function competently in, say, a small rural school who may not wish to be paid for their services, just as some people in local government do not claim attendance allowance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a dangerous practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that it is dangerous, but it is dangerous to think that, because people are not paid for their services, they are not prepared to give the appropriate quality of service. If a clerk was not giving a high enough quality of service it would be open to the board to appoint someone else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clerk is not the board's only source of help in making major decisions. It can call on the local authority for advice and guidance and central Government will make a major contribution through training material and so on. The Committee agrees that the clerk is a key person who should have the necessary experience and expertise. The element of dogma arises, especially among Opposition Members, in the belief that the clerk should be an employee of the local authority and part of its structure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is selling the Bill short, and he will be selling his ideas short if he persists in this argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that school boards are important. Given that he created a great brouhaha throughout Scotland all last summer and had parents and teachers and everyone else who was interested in the subject discussing it—which was worth doing—the Minister must realise that it is right to accept the amendment of the hon. Member for Dumfries to give the boards the status that they deserve. They will not have that with amateurs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The status that they deserve is the status to make decisions according to what they consider best for their board. What the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth describes as amateurism is the ability of the board to appoint a professional employed by local government or to appoint someone who has more expertise and to pay him for that if necessary. There is no amateurism in that. On the contrary, I see an opportunity for the board to make what provision it considers appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman wishes the local authority to make the appointments, and the appointees to be local authority employees, because he sees this as a means of controlling the board, whereas I see the clerk as a means by which the boards can flourish and exercise the power and authority that the legislation provides.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister is trying to be helpful, but I find it difficult to appreciate the delicacies of the argument.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give a commitment that if a board decides to appoint a professional on proper pay scales, which could amount to £10,000 the funding of that salary will be assumed in the board's budget and, as a consequence, will be underwritten to the extent that education expenditure is usually funded relative to rate support grant? This is a crucial point. On the difference between amateurism and professionalism, the Minister has let the proverbial cat out of the bag by suggesting that the board can appoint from within if it wishes, and that that is amateurism. We argue that if the board decides to go for a professional who is outwith its composition, the Government should finance that fully as part of the normal rate support grant settlement. That would be effective and real choice backed by rate support grant funding by the Scottish Office, not an illusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was an intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. As the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) has made the point, I must say that it was rather a long intervention. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will note that interventions should be brief. If hon. Members wish to make a speech they may attempt to catch my eye and, as the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) knows, they always will.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was such a long intervention that I quite forgot that I was speaking. I find the argument of the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) difficult to understand. He asked me for undertakings about the school budget. A budget will be available to the school boards and it is for them to decide how to allocate it. His suggestion that because people on the board may take over responsibility for the clerk's function there is amateurism is absurd. It is conceivable that a school board's members could have all the talents and abilities needed to carry out their function to an extent. A chief executive of a local authority, or a director of education, as the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth asked me to confirm, could be a member. It is nonsense to argue that because individuals may be prepared to undertake the function at no cost to the taxpayer or to the board, so as to release funds for other activities of the board, it represents amateurism. We are hearing dogmatism from the hon. Member for Fife, Central. We are hearing a prejudiced view of how services should be provided for the board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Knox. The word "dogmatism" has been used twice or three times. We are asking a simple question. If a board decides to appoint someone outwith the board who is a professional and well funded, will the Minister make that cost available to the local authority or the school board through the usual rate support grant mechanism? Half-answers do not meet our objections to the proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's points of order are much shorter than his interventions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is asking me to stray out of order. If he will turn his mind back to the proceedings of the Committee, he will remember that we had a lengthy discussion about support for school boards from the rate support grant. I undertook to give full consideration to the costs of the boards in the funding that was provided. I challenged Opposition Members to press me for a specific grant for school boards and explain to COSLA why they had done so. No one leapt up to argue for that.

The hon. Gentleman must not ask me to confirm specific grants when he and his hon. Friends shied away from them. Only a fool would undertake to finance school boards to employ whom they liked to carry out their functions at whatever salary they wished. I am sure that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman answers his own question. School boards will have a budget and decide to employ whom they like. In administering that budget, they must take account of the costs involved in employing the clerk. As the hon. Gentleman believes that local authorities provide excellent value for money in Scotland, I am sure that he would expect that clerking services will stand competition against alternatives that may be open to the board.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with growing amusement as the Minister dug a deeper and deeper hole for himself. I was interested in his comment that if a board wished to appoint someone to carry out the function on a voluntary basis, it might do so and spend its grant on something else. I can assure him that if a board decided to do that, its grant would be reduced by the corresponding sum to ensure that the money would not be wasted but used appropriately. In that way, ratepayers and poll tax payers would get appropriate value for money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Had we been discussing the next group of amendments, I should have had more respect for the Minister's argument—not a lot more, but a little more. This is a modest amendment, which does not specify anything other than that a local authority will have ultimate responsibility for appointing a suitably qualified professional person to handle the school board's affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The thought of Fife, with its 200 schools, advertising for retired bank managers or whatever to carry out those functions beggars belief. We are talking about a professional organisation which is supposed to enhance Scottish education. The Bill proposes a Mickey Mouse procedure for appointing professional support. The school board will have to consider regulations, the Act, the interpretation of the Act, the functioning of the committee, and so on, and the board must be given appropriate support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment does not preclude the Minister specifying that the school board should be involved in the appointment. All it says is that the local education authority should take over the practical responsibility of making the appointment. The school board could interview people to find someone acceptable. That could be specified in the regulations. It could also be specified that the person would be accountable to the chairman and the board to ensure that the influence of the school board would be preserved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment merely seeks to stop the basic dislike of the functions of a local authority. I use the word "dogmatic" rather than "dogmatism" as I am suspicious of the antecedents of the latter—I had always thought that "dogma" was the correct nominative. Nothing in the amendment prevents the involvement of the school board, so the Minister should reconsider his opposition to the proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From discussions that I have had with interested parents in my constituency, it seems that parents like to think that whoever is appointed is capable of doing the job and understands what the board wishes to achieve. One assumes that the board would not appoint a person who was not competent to carry out his responsibilities and duties. If the local authority were able, in a competitive manner, to provide an individual capable of carrying out those duties, surely no one would object. A local authority
	<span class='label label-info column'>396</span>
might not and probably would not be able to offer a competent person. In that case, the board would find someone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There seems to be no shortage of volunteeers in my area. Solicitors, doctors, bank managers and retired military personnel have volunteered. An earlier observation seemed to suggest that there was some disadvantage in the military. My part of the world is a popular area for retirement and we are blessed with many retired military personnel, who have had a sound training in administration and are good organisers. They would be ideal to carry out the duties and responsibilities required by a board. Many of them have young children at local schools and people in rural areas know much more about the community atmosphere than those who live in towns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see why the appointment should be left to the local authority. It should properly be in the hands of the board. If the local authority is willing and able to provide someone, the board would view that with sympathy and understanding and the person might be exactly the right candidate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Although I am not especially happy about it, my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North persuades me to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I hope that instead, through the generosity of someone on the Chairman's Panel or in the Clerk's Office, that group of amendments may be selected on Report.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Being a simple person I like simple language. The language of the clause is not simple. Indeed, it gives an almost judicial or constitutional aspect to the expected exchanges between the boards and others. It should be sufficient to allow the board the power to invite anyone to participate in its discussions. Therefore, we should eliminate the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"or representing persons interested in".</p></blockquote>
If the board is allowed to make the many decisions and decentralise, as the Minister suggests, it should be left to it to invite anyone to participate in its discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 103 is essential. Boards are being introduced without proper foundation of parental involvement. Only 25 per cent, of schools have parent-teacher associations. It is recognised that school councils operate less than successfully; there is all-party agreement on that. Open meetings are essential to encourage all parents to take an active interest in the affairs of the school. The prospects for democracy and accountability under the Bill are extremely bleak. The climate is not right for school boards to meet parents on a set number of occasions each year. Meetings called by parents have the power to propose resolutions, but the school board need not act on them. Local authorities cannot act in the interests of parents to ensure that school boards pay attention to the parents' wishes. Discussion at those meetings will be limited to the matters on the agenda. In their comments on the acquisition of additional delegated powers, the Government recognised the danger of cliques taking over school boards. Therefore, it is necessary that meetings are open to the public and the press. The right of parents to an interview with the school board strengthens accountability and the amendment is tabled in that vein.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I agree with the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) about the clarity of the Bill. Clause 6(10) states carefully that boards may invite anyone who is relevant to their discussions. It does not provide for the construction of an alternative to a public gallery where anyone can go along regardless of whether his contribution is relevant to the board's discussions or whether he can help the board to fulfil its function. I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's criticism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a raft of requirements that the boards take account of parents' views. They are obliged under clause 12(2) to report to parents and to ascertain their views. They are obliged under clause 13 to call a meeting with parents at any time if sufficient parents
	<span class='label label-info column'>398</span>
request it. A parental majority is required under schedule 3 if they wish to proceed to an appeal on delegation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill provides for boards to invite "anybody"—in the words of the hon. Member for Dumbarton—provided that he or she is relevant to the deliberations. Parents can question the board at any time. We have deliberately adopted that approach rather than the annual report and annual meeting format because it makes the boards more accountable. The spirit of the amendment is already contained in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister believes that the spirit of the amendment is contained in the Bill, but I am not convinced that it is. He referred to parents' rights to be represented and to the fact that school boards must refer to parents, to ascertain their views and to call a meeting if a specific number of parents request it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The crux of the amendment is that it refers to any occasion on which an especially important decision is to be taken by a board. For example, it will be possible for school boards to take over responsibility for school uniforms, rules and discipline. There may be a crucial meeting at which a board will take a critical decision that will affect every parent of children at the school. Because that decision may be unpopular, some people may not wish to allow parents to attend the meeting and to lobby the board. Parents should have the right to lobby any meeting and to be present at any board meeting during which decisions are taken which affect the schooling of their children. The Minister must concede that there will be occasions which are not covered by the Bill which would be covered by the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the board were to take a controversial decision which was of great interest, 30 parents, or 25 per cent, of parents with children at the school, would request a meeting with the board to discuss the issue, and the Bill provides for such an occasion. If some parents wished to make a contribution to a board's meeting on some issue, clause 6(10) would allow the board to invite them to attend. On both counts, therefore, the Bill already makes provision: the board can involve people who have a contribution to make and parents can bring the board to account on specific issues. The effect of the amendment would be to create an alternative to a public gallery. As I have said already, public access will be provided separately to board proceedings. I cannot understand the hon. Gentleman's objection to the provisions in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no objections to the provisions in the Bill; I think that they do not go far enough. Is the Minister saying that he is providing separately for access to school board meetings similar to that of ratepayers to regional and district council meetings? They have the right of attendance, the right to lobby and the right to make representations at any meeting they wish if they give notice of their intentions.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0970">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>399</span>
I am perfectly happy if that is the Minister's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what I am saying. The hon. Gentleman should recognise that clause 6(10) goes much further than he suggests, as it enables people to attend meetings, and also to speak. That allows greater involvement than the mere right to observe the proceedings of the school board, which will be provided for in the regulations that we have already discussed here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus the public will have the opportunity to come along to meetings, and interested persons can be invited by the board if it wishes; there is also provision for parents to call a meeting to bring the board to account. It is difficult to see what more we could offer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One or two aspects of this provision could be thrashed out later.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have just heard a rumour that amendment No. 105, which I did not move, would have been accepted. The reason why I did not move it was that I thought that it was badly drafted and that the wording was the wrong way round. If the Minister amended the Bill so that the wording in our amendment were the right way round, it would be another concession for which we would hang out the flags in Stirling next week—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I did not catch that sedentary intervention from my very nearly hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro), on the back row of the Government Benches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do, however, move amendments Nos. 155 and 170. We believe that it is necessary to prevent funds and property held by a school board or an interim school board from going into limbo when the board
	<span class='label label-info column'>400</span>
ceases to exist. The amendments would permit the transfer of the funds and property of the former board to its successor. That is consistent with the transfer of functions under the clause. We are seeking to tidy up the clause so that the position about money and possessions is clear. Over the years, the boards will develop funds and property. In time, it may be considered that they own them, and problems will arise when there are school mergers and the like.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had that difficulty back in the days of local government reorgansiation. At that time, we had to set up a commission to handle it because it was so serious. It was not simply a matter of who got the provost's chain. The problem was, who got the buildings and the land? It was a serious and difficult matter with which the new authorities had to deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are now discussing the smaller problem of what will happen when schools combine. I hope that the Minister will accept that the amendments, which are sponsored by COSLA, are tabled in good faith.

	<span class='label label-info column'>401</span>
the internal and external audit arrangements operated by that authority".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) said that Opposition Members have been more successful in convincing the Minister of their arguments than the right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) and the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro). That is because we share a common background with the Minister which they do not. He comes from a good working-class background in Arbroath, and there is a rapport between him and us, at least on some issues. That shows even in these dark days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 8(1) deals with the powers of school boards to enter into contracts and agreements and to invest money. It is an important clause because it represents a radical change in the way in which schools have been run in the past. If the amendments were accepted, they would ensure that schools boards would, when exercising their powers, comply with the financial regulations of the contracting, tendering and purchasing procedures of education authorities. They would be subject to internal and external audit arrangements of the education authority in their areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are no provisions in the Bill for proper control of the boards' financial and contractual powers. The amendments seek to remedy that and to achieve proper financial regulation of their contractual powers and to ensure that they do not commit authorities to expenditure without the authorities' agreement or knowledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that school boards normally co-operate within the framework of local authority financing and that the money allocated to their control will necessarily be subject to the controls, restraints and adjustments that are typical of local authority financial operations. But the boards will have their own financial operations, which will be separate from those of the education authorities. The boards will have the power to raise and spend their own money. They may be responsibility for recurrent school budgets, per capita expenditure and other contractual operations, such as the right to enter contracts as agents for the authorities. For example, contract tendering for school services, such as maintenance of school grounds, may be left to the school boards, which would enter into contracts with contractors with exchanges of money and expenditure to the contractor for his services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such financial activities should be subject to the proper financial procedures and regulations that affect all authorities' financial activities. There should be internal and external audit to ensure not only that the boards are receiving value for money, but that the members of the boards are carrying out their duties responsibly. The contracting, tendering and purchasing procedures of the boards should be in line with the contracting, tendering and purchasing procedures laid down by the education authorities. When contracts are issued, it must be seen that they are awarded fairly and in the best interests of the schools, and that people do not exploit their position on the boards to award contracts to family, friends
	<span class='label label-info column'>402</span>
and associates, but award them within the strict procedures that govern the awarding of contracts by local authorities. The tendering procedure must be strictly monitored and dealt with openly and fairly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was a convener in local authorities, there was strict procedure for opening tender documents to ensure that there was no possibility of people using their position to award contracts unfairly. The same procedures should apply to school boards as apply to education authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those procedures should also apply to the purchasing that will be undertaken by the school boards. Conservative Members are always talking about obtaining value for money. Responsible local authorities, which in the main are Labour authorities, obtain value for money by having purchasing policies that ensure that they buy as cheaply as possible and make the most efficient use of the money that is available to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fundamental to the growth of local authority expenditure has been its proper control, monitoring and implementation by local councillors. School boards will take on significant financial responsibilities and it is important that their members' conduct is subject to the same sort of scrutiny as local councillors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment throws into sharp focus the centralist tendencies of the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion)— 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> No, he is a centralist, although most centralists are dogmatists. That raises serious questions about his commitment to parental participation in the running of schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the amendments would be absurd. A board that wished to buy stationery could not do so because it would involve a contract or purchase agreement. It would have to go cap-in-hand to the authority almost every time it wanted to do anything.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can envisage the absurd position that would result if amendment No. 132 were accepted. A board that wished to spend a gift of money on new equipment for the school would not have the power to make such a purchase. That hardly seems something for which the board should be dependent on the approval of the education authority. I am sure that parents would take a dim view of this attempt to bind school boards, so the amendment is unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The power to engage in contracts and agreements is vital to the principle of delegation. Although we shall discuss delegation of functions at a later stage under clause 15, the provisions in the clause empower education authorities to attach to a delegation order any condition which they consider appropriate. Those conditions could relate to financial regulation and auditing arrangements and we have made it perfectly clear all along that we envisage boards operating within the authorities' financial management systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As it stands, the Bill does not empower education authorities to impose central purchasing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0972">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>403</span>
arrangements on school boards as the hon. Gentleman would like and such a provision would be completely at odds with the principle of local decision-making that we want to encourage. However, there is nothing in the Bill to prevent a board from being a party to a group purchasing arrangement or agreeing, if it so wished, to having central purchasing arrangements built into a delegation order as an agreed condition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the hon. Gentleman that boards will be under a duty to act in accordance with their local authorities' statutory duties which include the provision of adequate and efficient education. Obviously, that requires a board to have regard to its authority's purchasing arrangements and not to choose a method of purchase that was less efficient than that of the authority, assuming that it could find one. However, a board should not have an inefficient arrangement foisted on it. For that reason, I am unable to accept either amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister give us an example of an inefficient purchasing arrangement of a local authority in Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We could start with the history of Glasgow's direct labour organisation and move on to that of Stirling to find examples of inefficient purchasing arrangements by local authorities that used those organisations to provide them with maintenance and housing.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am talking about supply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

Gentleman that I understand that my local authority has now gone into the business of manufacturing windows. No doubt boards will take a view on what represents an efficient purchasing arrangement for them. That is what the Bill provides, but the amendments seek to constrain them so that they would be required to act in accordance with the instructions of a local authority and to take the services available from that authority. That would restrict their choice. I understand why the Labour party should have proposed such an amendment, but I am not prepared to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was surprised to be called a centralist, as I have been a life-long devolutionist and supporter of a Scottish Assembly. I was accused of being a centralist by someone who is utterly opposed to the idea of devolution. Indeed, only last Friday in Perth he was using words such as "Devolution is now stone dead", "Centralism rules" and so on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For once, I feel outnumbered by Scottish Tories, which is an incredible experience. I find myself alone on this side of the Committee facing a full squad on the other side. That is an unusual even in Scottish politics. The boot is usually on the other foot. Opposition Members have been in the majority for the most part, although that is not reflected here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the Division in the House I was speaking in response to the Minister's replies to amendments Nos. 132 and 156. The Minister dealt mainly with the purchasing arrangements into which school boards might enter. He said that, if they wished, school boards could form group purchasing arrangements or enter into some kind of central purchasing arrangment through the education authority. It is incredible for the Minister to suggest that it might be in the interests of schools to enter into group or central purchasing arrangement while making the means whereby that could be achieved through the education authority virtually impossible by insisting that the boards should not be tied in any way to the financial procedures to which the education authority has tied itself. I find that very strange.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned that the boards had a duty to act in accordance with the statutory duties imposed on the education authority, which included providing education efficiently, but that hardly seems a sufficient way to ensure that money is well spent within school boards. The Minister said very little about the award of contracts through school boards and virtually nothing about the requirements for internal or external audit. I must therefore press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 157, in page 6, line 9, leave out subsection (2) and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2) A School Board exercising any function delegated to them under section IS below shall be deemed, as regards contractual relations with third parties, to be the agent of their education authority, provided that the exercise is in compliance with this Act and with any conditions imposed under this Act, but where in consequence of this subsection an education authority incurs liability to a third party that authority shall have a right of relief against the School Board concerned.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it may be convenient to take amendment No. 158, in page 6, line 13, leave out subsection (3) and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) Subject to the provisions of this subsection the members of a School Board shall not incur any personal liability in respect of the property and liabilities of the School Board, but sections 102 to 104 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 shall apply to School Boards as to local authorities.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments deal with the issue of school boards being treated as agents of the educaion authority in relation to third parties. Subsection (2) gives contractors entering into contracts with school boards the assurance that they will be able to pursue claims against the education authority, even if the school board is disestablished or otherwise unable to meet its obligations. A clear responsibility is laid at the door of the education authority for whatever the board decides to do. In respect of contractual relations with third parties, the amendments provide that where the education authority incurs liability to a third party arising out of the action of a school board, the authority shall have a right of relief against the school board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Bill stands, there is an unrestricted guarantee by the education authority for whatever the school board may do, yet the authority has only limited control over what a board may do. For example, a school board could enter into a contract with a third party for grounds maintenance or for the supply of books and materials. If the board is found to be in breach of that contract, the education authority—not the school board—is held liable for that breach of contract. That means that third parties need not worry about entering into agreements with school boards, because there would be a guarantee of payment by the ratepayers—or, eventually, poll tax payers. School boards do not have to worry either, because their members would have no personal liability for any default of which the board may be guilty. Only the education authority and the poll tax payers need worry because they will be held financially responsible for the board's actions. We should not encourage such irresponsibility in members of school boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 157 deals only with cases where it is reasonable to treat boards as agents of the authority—that is, where they have been delegated specific powers by the education authority. Boards will have to work within the conditions and limitations laid down by the terms of that delegation, but once the powers are delegated the education authority will have no control over those powers. It may be reasonable for an education authority to be
	<span class='label label-info column'>406</span>
made liable for damages to a contractor, to ensure that contractors would be willing to enter into arrangements with school boards. However, it would also be reasonable for an authority to be able to recover its loss from the board which was responsible for the loss. That is what amendment No. 157 proposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 158 deals with the exclusion of personal liability, as defined in clause 8(3), especially as it avoids liability for ultra vires actions on the part of board members. The reliance on the test of good faith raises evidential questions which will be extremely difficult for a court to establish. How can it be proved that someone acted in good faith? The Minister sits there as a representative of the Scottish people, who elected him in good faith to represent Scottish interests. He has not done that, but how can we prove that he was not elected in good faith last June? It is a serious problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also entirely reasonable to equate the liability of board members with the liability at present attributed to local authority members contained in sections 102 to 104 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. Section 102 provides for reports by the Controller of Audit and for him to produce special reports that identify individual responsibility, if it is thought necessary, for any breach of contract. Section 103 provides for investigation of such a report by the Commission for Local Authority Accounts in Scotland which will then report to the Secretary of State for Scotland and may recommend surcharge. Section 104 contains the powers of the Secretary of State for Scotland to order surcharges on individuals who are held responsible for a misdemeanour or misuse of their powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those powers are seldom used against local authority members, but they provide an important financial control. More importantly, they provide a forceful sanction against any type of ultra vires action by local authority members. The section has worked very effectively in local government and there is no reason why it should not work equally effectively for school boards. I strongly recommend that the Minister accept that there is a problem here and that the most appropriate way to tackle it is to apply to school boards the same conditions as those applying to local authority members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again, I am acting as the mouthpiece of the Law Society of Scotland, which has commented on clause 8. It appropriate to mention this in relation to the amendments. The Law Society of Scotland states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The clause gives Boards powers relevant to the discharge of their functions. It provides for Boards to be treated, in relation to third parties, as agents of the education authorities, and limits the personal liabilities of Board members. It requires Boards to take account of the interests of further education where the premises or equipment of a school are used for that purpose. The clause also requires Boards to ensure compliance with any legal duties of their education authorities and enables authorities to obtain information from Boards about the discharge of their functions.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>As far as we can determine, the education authorities would be responsible for all acts of a School Board, whether or not these fell within the vires of the Board, or indeed of the education

	<span class='label label-info column'>407</span>
authority itself. We believe that this position represents a departure from recognised principles and that the position of the School Board as agent of the education authority may prove problematic."</p></blockquote>
The question, therefore, is whether amendments Nos. 157 and 158 meet the difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To summarise my few remarks, amendments No. 157 and 158 are an honest and reasonable attempt to meet the problem. They were unbeknown to the Law Society of Scotland and were submitted before we received its observations. I fully accept that the Minister may not be happy with the drafting, but I hope that he will say that he is prepared to reconsider the matter before Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not rise to make the comments for which the hon. Gentleman hopes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first of the two amendments would restrict the relationship of agency between a board and its authority. We are creating perhaps somewhat controversial provisions in respect of boards' liabilities, but that is simply to create the necessary space and freedom to enable the boards to operate. Overall, they will remain within the local authority managed system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision of subsection (2) make a board the agent of its authority for the purposes of its relations with third parties. That enables third parties—contractors—to be in a position where they are willing to enter into agreements with the boards, which could be disestablished under clause 20. The provision is an important safeguard for contractors and for other third parties dealing with the boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 157 tries to make it more difficult for boards to take on delegated functions by restricting the protection for contractors. I am sure that that is the intention behind the amendment. The proposal would cause difficulties for a board trying to enter into contracts and agreements and would be unfair to the third parties involved. For example, it would prevent a visitor to a school where the board had delegated responsibility for maintenance from claiming against the authority if a brick fell from a doorway and injured him. If the board went out of existence and had no funds to meet the claim, the visitor would be without redress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By restricting the relationship of agency to acts complying with the terms of the delegated functions, the amendment would further restrict the protection for third parties, it would place an unreasonable burden on a contractor, who would have to be certain that his agreement with a board fell within the terms of the relevant delegation order between the authority and the board. That would be most unfair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) argued that there should be a right of relief against boards when liability was incurred. That proposal
	<span class='label label-info column'>408</span>
sounds fine in theory, but in practice it would be unreasonable to allow an authority to make a claim on money given to the board for the benefit of the school under clause 18. If hon. Gentlemans acknowledge that it would be improper to use that money for such a purpose, the only money available to claim against would be the board's budget. We would have the absurdity of a local authority claiming against itself, as it would have provided the money in the first place. The Bill contains provisions to enable a local authority to suspend or revoke a delegated function and in such circumstances the local authority may wish to use those powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the spirit behind amendment No. 158. It looks equitable to apply the same controls to board members as to councillors, but it is a pretty cumbersome and bureaucratic approach. If an authority and a board agree that the board should handle a sum of money physically apart from the local authority machinery, it is open to the board to apply as a condition of delegation that specific and audit procedures are followed. Under clause 8(5), boards are required to ensure that authorities, statutory and other legal duties are complied with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Far from extending the liability of board members, the amendment would limit it. By restricting liability mainly to financial procedures and properties, the amendment appears to overlook the board's other functions. For example, under the amendment a board member could maliciously exercise a function in relation to senior appointments at a school and incur no liability. Under the Bill he would have to act in good faith to enjoy that protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill provides the right balance between giving boards freedom to enter into contracts and providing proper protection for those involved, while at the same ensuring that machinery is available to the local authority to ensure proper provisions for the management of money and for propriety in handling it. I hope that I can persuade the Opposition not to press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the intention of the amendment was to make it more difficult for boards to take on delegated functions, but it is nothing of the kind. The intention of the amendment is to make sure that elected members of school boards act responsibly in exercising the powers delegated to them by education authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will certainly make it more difficult for the boards, and for contractors, if the responsibility of education authorities is limited only to that over which they have control. It is the basic right of education authorities not to be held liable for the actions of agents over which they have no control. It is absurd that education authorities, and through them the ratepayers and poll tax payers will be held liable for the actions of people who are not held accountable for their own actions. Therefore, I shall persist with the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I do not want 	<i>The Press and Journal to</i> get another scoop from the friendly rivalry between the right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) and the hon.

My right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) has

referred to new clause 3, which is tabled in his name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro) and will provide an opportunity further to discuss this matter. We have, of course, discussed this before during the Committee's second sitting when we discussed the title of school boards. I made it clear then that we want to encourage co-operative working between boards on appropriate issues. I am not convinced that it is necessary to include statutory powers in the Bill permitting such co-operation and, since there is nothing to prevent that co-operation, this new subsection is only an exhortation to boards to co-operate. I do not think that exhortation should be included in statute—it is more appropriate for guidance.
