You will be interested to know that during the last sitting of the Committee agreement was reached between the Opposition and the Government about the future progress of our consideration of the Bill, but it is not in keeping with the spirit of that for the Government to table 66 amendments within hours of the agreement being reached.

	<br><blockquote><p>'(8A) It shall be the duty of Scottish Homes to consult with local authorities, housing associations, other housing providers, tenants' organisations, relevant voluntary organisations and other bodies, as the Secretary of State may prescribe, and to publish annually an investment strategy taking into account representations made.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<ol>
	<li>registered housing associations</li>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to welcome you back, Mr. Martin. You have not missed a great deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee would be well advised to spend a moment considering the implications of the duty placed on Scottish Homes by the Bill to consult local authorities, housing associations, other housing providers, tenants' organisations and the relevant voluntary organisations and also its duty to publish
	<span class='label label-info column'>464</span>
an annual investment strategy taking account of representations. So far as I can see, there is no such explicit obligation in the Bill. Given the crucial role of Scottish Homes and the size of its budget, it is essential not only to continue the Housing Corporation's common practice of issuing an annual investment strategy but to strengthen that through the Bill by statutory and stipulated consultation on its content with the range of bodies suggested in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of Scottish Homes' enhanced role and bigger budget and the Housing Corporation's common practice of issuing an annual investment strategy, it is not unreasonable to spend some time considering the range of organisations that Scottish Homes might be obliged to consult during that enhanced consultation process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to do no more nor less than that, and it will be interesting to hear what the Government have to say. One of the Minister's favourite excuses—that of precedent—is involved here because the Housing Corporation's common practice covers at least the principles enshrined in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tabled amendment No. 58 so long ago that I cannot remember why I did so, except perhaps to take a side swipe at the Secretary of State who has sweeping powers under subsection (9). More seriously, the equivalent powers that the Secretary of State already has in relation to the Housing Corporation are much more constrained when one considers the extent of the Housing Corporation's remit. Subsection (9) as it stands is rather sweeping. The Government should justify these extra, unfettered powers to be used by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 121, my honourable Friends and I feel strongly that it would be advantageous at the beginning of each year for the budget for Scottish Homes to be broken down to set the tone and the strategy of how the resources will be deployed. The Minister will argue that he wants to give maximum flexibility and as much power as possible to the board, the chief executive and the chairman to do the best that they can in the circumstances. That is a reasonable argument. Some of my hounourable Friends, however, fear that the ability of Scottish Homes, which has no guidance about how the relative priorities should be set in terms of the financial allocations within the budget, is too loose ab initio. No one has any idea how the balance of the allocation of funds will fall. It is right for the Committee to spend a moment or two considering whether it is prepared to allow the membership of Scottish Homes to go completely off at a tangent. In terms of financial allocation, Scottish Homes has power to put all its eggs in one basket and starve other important bodies in the housing sector of the finance that it will have at its beck and all without recourse to anyone whatsoever. The situation should be considered for that reason if for no other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What concerns me more than anything—it derives from legal experience—is the potential conflict of interest that may arise. As I understand it—I am
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0335">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>465</span>
always willing to be put right about matters if I have misunderstood them—Scottish Homes will be bidding, for some of the money and using it directly, spending the cash as well as allocating it to other agencies and housing associations. How can it be allowed to dish out money on the one hand while on the other accepting and spending money without any guidance or framework for the balance of the budget allocated to it year by year? If I am wrong, I shall be pleased to be put right. There is a combination of two factors, the wide powers given to Scottish Homes by the Bill and the potential conflit that could lead to claims or suspicions or partiality. I do not wish to impugn the standing or integrity of those who will be elected to the board, but those are important questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would also be sensible and more reasonable for the Committee to ask for broad guidelines to be put into the Bill. We should like broad categories put clearly on to the face of the Bill to which Scottish Homes would have to adhere. They would not be unduly restrictive, because they would be the only categories within which it could operate. If the Secretary of State each year were to say that, plus or minus a margin, which could be 10 per cent.—I am willing to listen to the arguments—within a broad category the allocation of the budget should be fixed, we should know the ground rules and people outside would have an idea where the balance of the finance would go. We should be able to watch that change. No doubt the priorities will change. That will be reflected by the Secretary of State at the beginning of the year in setting out broad categories of finance within which Scottish Homes should work. I hope that the Committee will spend time discussing these clarifying amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) was being uncharacteristically generous to the proposed members of the board when he said that at this stage he did not want to cast any aspersions on their integrity. He referred to them as "elected" members of the board. That must have been a slip of the tongue, in the first instance they will be appointees of the Secretary of State for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will set up a massive new organisation with a wide range of functions which, apparently, will be in competition with one another. Those functions will be: the promotion of the private sector, the maintenance or development of the public sector, the issue of grants for improving houses, and responsibility for housing associations and co-operatives. It is important that there be a clear understanding at the outset about what the priorities will be and what share of the funds the expertise and the work of Scottish Homes will be allocated to each sector. We have had no explanation of that and wish to hear what the Minister has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to respond. The honourable Gentleman for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood)
	<span class='label label-info column'>466</span>
concentrated on the theme of consultation, and I sympathise with that. He asks whether the powers are too wide. They are based on the powers of the Scottish Development Agency which has the flexibility to respond to changing priorities. We want to retain that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There can be no disagreement over the basic concerns shown in amendments Nos. 120 and 121, which call for proper planning of investment—which will certainly take place—and a proper role for the Secretary of State in the allocation of resources. However, the amendments bring us back to a familiar area of disagreement. Opposition Members seek to over formalise arrangements which the experience of existing bodies, such as the SDA, shows work well without tightly drawn statutory provisions. One of the dangers of writing in too many statutory provisions is that the statute might have to be changed every few years. We wish to provide sufficient flexibility without dotting all the 'i's and crossing all the 't's.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no dispute about the fact that Scottish Homes must have a forward investment strategy such as the Housing Corporation and the SSHA have now. I have made that clear in debates on earlier amendments. Scottish Homes will also publish a corporate plan and will operate within the terms of a financial memorandum that will be made available to those who want it. Specific financial directions will be issued by the Secretary of State. The financial planning and control arrangements for a large non-Departmental public body with a variety of functions are complex. They rely on the relationship between various formal documents rather than on one document alone. Amendments Nos. 120 and 121 do not begin to do justice to those complex relationships.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is surely a distinction between freedom of action within bodies such as the SSHA and the Housing Corporation and that within the omnibus operation that the Government propose. The Minister tells us that a corporate plan and financial guidelines will be laid down by the Secretary of State. That is important. Will the guidelines show the proportion of the budget that will be directed towards housing associations and the proportion that will be directed towards the landlord division and the promotion of private landlordism?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The short answer is yes. The allocation of resources year by year should be made absolutely clear. That leads me to the question about guidance asked by the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire. There is no question of Scottish Homes acting without guidance from the Secretary of State. The broad allocation of resources between activities will be subject to agreement with the Secretary of State. That is exactly what happens now in the content of the Scottish Development Agency and we believe that we do not need statutory provision to achieve that. It is unproductive in principle to seek to reduce such complex matters to statutory provisions. As I said earlier, our experience with the Housing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0336">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>467</span>
Corporation, the SSHA, the SDA and other bodies demonstrate that good arrangements can be developed without statutory provision of that sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that there are grounds for anxiety. I have made it clear in earlier debates that Scottish Homes will routinely consult local authorities and others, and that the broad allocation of resources between various activities will be subject to the agreement of the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire explained the purpose of amendment No. 58. I found his explanation difficult to understand, especially as his contributions to earlier debates were extremely thoughtful. The Opposition stressed the importance of these powers and the general thrust of the amendment is to give the Secretary of State the necessary residual powers to make a direction. The honourable Gentleman also raised the matter of potential conflict of interests. I do not think that that will arise because subsection (9) makes it clear that the Secretary of State can and will give guidance in that connection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, it may assist the Committee if I respond to the question asked by the honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) about the large number of Government amendments. They are virtually all of a technical nature and we can quickly dispose of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We want to make progress. I am less than satisfied with the Minister's answers. He is leaving a great many hostages to fortune in terms of the future work of Scottish Homes, but in order to expedite proceedings, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment made:</i> No. 129, in page 4, line 17, leave out "give effect to" and insert "comply with".—[	<i>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition started consideration of the Bill willing to give the Government the benefit of several doubts about the principle of this new national housing agency. During our debates in Committee, the Government have confirmed most of our existing doubts about the nature of Scottish Homes and have raised several new fears about its powers and the way in which those powers are likely to be exercised—especially under the present minority Administration. We had hoped that the agency would be willing to help local authorities to carry out a major survey of the crisis in Scottish housing—homelessness, overcrowding, house conditions and dampness—and that it would then support local authorities in a nationally co-ordinated strategy to deal with those serious problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>468</span>
In so far as the Minister has replied to our points, he has shown that the Government are not interested in solving the problems. They do not want to know about the extent of homelessness or about the bad housing conditions in Scotland. They simply want to centralise more power and control in the Scottish Office, and they appear to want to divert funds from public sector housing, with all its problems, into the hands of private landlords. For those reasons I urge the Committee to vote against clause 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I reject everything that the honourable Gentleman has said. The clause gives considerable powers to a new Scottish housing development agency. The purpose of that is to reduce the levels of homelessness in Scotland by bringing back into use a high percentage of the approximately 130,000 vacant houses in Scotland. The powers are detailed and have sufficient flexibility to allow Scottish Homes to respond with maximum speed and effectiveness in all circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter of the survey has been thoroughly debated and it has been made clear that district councils are strongly encouraged to carry out the surveys—bearing in mind their existing statutory obligations. The powers are sufficient, but the difference between what is proposed in the Bill and what has existed in the past is that the urban renewal that will take place as a result of the powers conferred by clause 2 is likely to continue at a speed and to an extent not witnessed in the past. The Bill will be of enormous importance in the years to come.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>the transfer of their tenancies to Scottish Homes.".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As is well known, the Bill will have far-reaching implications for the tenants of 83,000 SSHA houses. This point was clearly brought home to me during the latter part of last year when I had a series of opportunities to meet representatives of those tenants in my own constituency. There are 1,150 SSHA tenants in East Lothian. Those tenants left me in no doubt about their anger at the Government's proposal to impose radical changes on the structure of their landlord organisation and on the future arrangements for their tenancies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was quite an achievement to get so many tenants to rally round their landlord as those SSHA tenants have done, particularly—as in my constituency—when such tenants find themselves in identical houses and often in the same street as local authority tenants, but paying up to £20 a month more rent. Nevertheless, they were so alarmed at the proposals in the original Scottish Homes consultation document that they were motivated to activate tenants' associations and campaigns to resist the Government's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is coming through loud and clear that tenants want to remain in the public sector. Indeed, if they were compelled to leave their current landlord and the SSHA, I believe that most of them would prefer to be transferred to district council tenancies rather than be squeezed into the private sector as the Government evidently intend. They are certainly violently opposed to the prospect of being levered into the private sector according to the Government's original proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We understand from those proposals that existing tenants will remain secure, but there must be some doubt about the future, given the Government's stated long-term aim of reducing the public sector of housing in Scotland and encouraging private landlordism. The Government must reply to that, because they have been all over the place on this issue since the beginning of this debate. The Government said in paragraph 34 of the original consultation document:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State has in mind that, on the creation of Scottish Homes, the entire stock of SSHA houses should be transferred, as a holding corporation, to a new 'landlord' division of Scottish Homes."</p></blockquote>
In paragraph 35 they say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Arrangements for a 'landlord' division would be essentially transitional and Scottish Homes would be asked to prepare and implement, as a matter of priority, proposals for new management arrangements for tenanted houses in SSHA estates in different areas of the country."</p></blockquote>
Those statements appear to suggest that the landlord division of Scottish Homes was essentially a short-term arrangement. As we know, it caused much worry and anger among SSHA tenants. The Government have encumbered the proposed
	<span class='label label-info column'>470</span>
Scottish Homes with the temporary ownership of 83,000 let houses, which had very little to do with their fundamental objectives. There are two separate arguments—first, the interests of SSHA tenants and, secondly, whether it is appropriate to insert those 83,000 directly let houses into the new Scottish Homes organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, with the publication of the White Paper and the Bill, the future of the SSHA landlord division is still uncertain. The Bill simply allows for the incorporation of the SSHA within Scottish Homes, without giving any idea of the future development of the landlord division. But the White Paper suggests at one and the same time that the landlord division will continue and may expand and that it may cease to exist. Paragraph 2.7 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Scottish Homes will continue the existing role of the SSHA as a model landlord in relation to its own stock."</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 2.18 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Government no longer consider it appropriate to take a fixed view of other aspects of the management structure, such as the proposal for Scottish Homes' involvement in the management of houses to be concentrated in a single landlord division."</p></blockquote>
So where exactly are we? What do the Government really want to do with those tenants and their homes?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also worth mentioning the £600 million accumulated debts of the SSHA, which caused such interest to the National Audit Office. As I understand it, every penny of rent collected from SSHA tenants goes to pay interest and loan charges on that debt. We shall return later to the finances of this operation and the impact of that accumulated debt on Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the consideration of the future of the 83,000 households the Government have treated them at best as pawns and at worst as an embarrassment. Those people are entitled to proper consultation and consideration before major decisions are taken about the future ownership and management of their homes. We have been impressed by the fully justified campaign by SSHA tenants all over Scotland in recent months. We deplore the Government's high-handed attitude and insist that SSHA tenants should be given an opportunity to vote on major decisions about the future of their public sector landlord. The Government are constantly posturing about tenants' rights and preaching about the virtues of ballots. Amendment No. 29 gives the Government an opportunity to practise what they preach for a change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot speak with any certainty about the mind of the Minister. There is, however, some evidence that suggests the thinking of the Secretary of State for Scotland. In a foreword to a book by Tom Begg which marked 50 years of the SSHA, the Secretary of State for Scotland described the association as
	<br><blockquote><p>"a key instrument in the development of housing policy in Scotland".</p></blockquote>
He went on to remark upon the association's responsiveness to the Government and spoke about its search for excellence, its economy and practical solutions and, above all, its persistence to make it work. We may deduce from the praise that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0338">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>471</span>
Secretary of State heaped upon the SSHA that he was pleased with the way in which the association had been performing; he clearly believed that it was well placed to continue to perform well in carrying out the Government's housing policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State invited readers to read the book from which they could learn much about the association's past role, and, more interestingly,
	<br><blockquote><p>"as well as speculate on what its future role may be".</p></blockquote>
I do not know when the Secretary of State wrote the foreword—perhaps we shall hear later—but I received my advance copy of the book after I was elected the Member for Dundee, East in June 1987. The book was published in 1987 and I deduce that the Secretary of State must have written the foreword some time in the first half of 1987. Yet something else appeared in the first half of 1987—the consultative document "Scottish Homes".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State made it clear that he recommended the dissolution or the abolition of the SSHA. There could not have been much room for speculation about the future role of the SSHA when the Secretary of State for Scotland called for such speculation. The decision about its future had been taken by the Minister. That is made absolutely clear in the annex to the SSHA's response to the consultative document. Tenants forced the SSHA to include an annex that gave their views. It gave an account of a meeting of SSHA tenants with various officials, including an official of the Scottish Home and Health Department, who made it clear that the ideas included in the consultation document did not come from housing professions or civil servants, but from Ministers. The phrase that was used was that the proposals expressed "what Ministers wanted to put forward."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that the idea to abolish the SSHA and replace it by Scottish Homes did not come from any other source than inside the Tory party. It probably came from the same think tank as gave us the poll tax. We probably have to be grateful to the Under-Secretary of State, the honourable Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) for the idea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first question that we must ask is to what extent the idea of abolition is representative of opinion in Scotland, especially among SSHA tenants. The Scottish Federation of Housing Association has commented on the suggestion. It said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Serious doubts were expressed however in our response to the consultative document over the proposal to include the SSHA in the new agency as it was felt that the future of the SSHA should be determined separately and in full consultation with its tenants."</p></blockquote>
It went on to say that it was
	<br><blockquote><p>"seriously alarmed at the proposal in the Bill to transfer the SSHA stock to Scottish Homes permanently."</p></blockquote>
There is no support for the abolition of the SSHA among housing associations without consulting the tenants and giving them a say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities took much the same attitude. Its reaction to the proposal was to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The abolition of the SSHA along the lines proposed will result in the loss of an important and effective Agency for Housing in Scotland and lead to great dissatisfaction for the majority of its 85,000 tenants".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>472</span>
It is not simply a matter of the housing associations and COSLA. The voluntary bodies have also come out strongly against the proposal. Shelter says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The inclusion of Scottish Special Housing Association into the New Agency is opposed by the overwhelming majority of tenants of the SSHA. It makes no sense in housing policy terms as it creates an inherently unstable organisation which has a large inhouse landlord division competing for resources with Housing Associations outwith the Agency. It offers a solution to the problems of peripheral estates which is contrary to the years of evidence of the Priority Estates Project. There are no proposals for decentralisation of Scottish Homes and there is no guarantee of tenant representation on the Board of Scottish Homes."</p></blockquote>
The tenants have made it clear that they, too, are opposed to the idea of abolition and especially to the idea of abolition without being given a right to vote upon it. My honourable Friend the Minister for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) said that he has spoken to people, as I have in Dundee, and there is unanimous hostility to this proposal and a determination to fight it. COSLA produced a resumé of all the responses to the Scottish Homes consultation document and there is a section dealing with the response of tenants. A very large number of submissions were received from tenants in which the SSHA was praised, both for its management and for the way in which it maintained its housing, and they all expressed a wish to remain as tenants of the SSHA. COSLA gives three quotations but it says that those sentiments have been repeated many times:
	<br><blockquote><p>"All wish to remain with the SSHA as their landlord."</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"We wish to remain as we are under the Scottish Special Housing Association."</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Why change an Association that operated for the good of its tenants and who are happy with the services provided."</p></blockquote>
That seems to be the universal response of SSHA tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, sometimes one must take the entire population into consideration as well as a group within it. It could normally be argued that the general election results override what groups within society may wish, but that could hardly be applied in the present circumstances, because after the general election result in Scotland three out of four Scottish voters said that they were opposed to such ideas being implemented in their country. In any case, we are dealing with the lives of between 85,000 and 120,000 Scottish tenants and we cannot legislate vital and dramatically to change people's lives without allowing them a say in the proposed changes. To do that is to be guilty of the worst aspects of despotism and dictatorship, and that accusation can accurately be levelled at the Government's handling of this aspect of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way to deal with despots and dictators who think that they always know best what is good for others is to have safeguards against them, and such safeguards have normally been associated with the ballot box. That is why it is vital that the tenants be given the right to vote on the proposals. The Government claim always to be in favour of ballots and they uphold the ballot as a means by which people can cast off those who try to oppress them. We have heard time and time again how the Government were prepared to give the right to vote to trade unionists so that they could bring the unions
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0339">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>473</span>
back under their control and away from the trade union barons, as the Government would have had it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful, Mr. Martin, to know that the poll tax registration has been made available to the Committee this morning at the request of Conservative members. I am sure that the poll tax will spring up many times during the next 14 months to haunt Ministers who have forced it on Scotland against its will. In the poll tax legislation the Government are arguing for a ballot, because they are trying to force tenants, through the poll tax, to use the ballot box against their local authorities and to vote against the provision of quality local services by the local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the Government's commitment to the ballot box is paper thin. Every time a ballot decision has gone against them or has been likely to go against them, the Government have not wanted to know about ballots. For example, Londoners voted for a council that the Government did not like and the Government's reaction was to remove from Londoners the right to vote for that council. There was then the recent election in Scotland, when the Scots voted three to one in favour of a Scottish assembly. So the Government simply decided to ignore the ballot. They sit in the dark, afraid to switch on the light, because they know that if they do, the wish of the people of Scotland for a Scottish assembly will be clear for everyone to see. Therefore the Government ignored that ballot result. Then the trade unionists used the ballot procedures given to them by the Government to vote for a strike. The Government did not like it, so they brought out other legislation to allow individuals to opt out of strike ballot results. I wonder when they will bring in legislation to allow Scotland to opt out in relation to England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government simply refuse to give SSHA tenants a ballot, because they know what the result will be: it will overturn the proposals in the White Paper. Mr Derek Mason, the chairman of the SSHA, has admitted as much. He is on record as saying that everyone knows that in a ballot almost every tenant would vote against the Government's proposals. That is the real reason why the Government refuse to give them a ballot on this important matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's behaviour in this matter is a disgrace, especially in a House which lays claim to being a seat of democracy. If this sort of action took place in Eastern Europe or in a Socialist African state, Tory Members would fall over themselves to rush into the newspapers and on to television to denounce in high moral tones its refusal to allow the right of a ballot. Yet when it happens unders their noses, by the Government whom they support, they silently look the other way and pretend that they do not hear anything.—Opposition Members will not be silent. We shall make sure that everyone hears that the Government are frightened of the ballot box and frightened to give SSHA tenants their rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a matter of extreme importance to tenants. As COSLA makes clear in its briefing on the amendment:
	<span class='label label-info column'>474</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"SSHA tenants enjoy secure tenancies, including the tenants' charter rights, the right to buy and relevant succession rights. Their entitlement to these rights should not be disturbed without their collective assent."</p></blockquote>
Those rights are being distributed by the proposals in the Bill. It is vital that the Government introduce such proposals only with the consent of the tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My honourable Friend the Member for East Lothian has already pointed out that the consultation paper originally said that the transfer of the landlord division to Scottish Homes would be purely on a transitional basis, but under pressure from the tenants the Government retracted on that and said that Scottish Homes could have landlord division permanently. But the suspicion must remain that in the long term the Government are forcing tenants, first, out of the SSHA and thereafter out of Scottish Homes into a new type of owner-occupation, housing Co-operative or whatever it may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Vital issues are at stake. My honourable Friend the Member for East Lothian mentioned the huge debt that the SSHA will transfer to Scottish Homes. That debt must have implications for rents and the way in which Scottish Homes will conduct itself, and must lead to serious questions to tenants about the likely impact on their rents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that the Government had a big problem with the SSHA. They were subsidising it to the tune of £25 million a year, and that went totally against Government policy. Comparing subsidies an SSHA house and those for a local authority house is like comparing night with day. A massive subsidy was given to SSHA houses as opposed to local authority houses. The Government wanted to get the tenants out of the public sector altogether. They tried to do it by introducing a transitional stage through Scottish Homes and they have been forced to backtrack on that, but the suspicion remains that their long-term objective is to force tenants out of the public sector and into the private sector. Tenants have rumbled that, and the Government are frightened to give tham a chance to comment on this development. Therefore, they are denying them the right of a ballot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government are serious about giving each individual greater control over his housing and living conditions, they should live up to that and give tenants a right to a ballot and a say in these proposals. As they have denied tenants that, we must be suspicious about their intentions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The objective of amendment No. 113 is almost on all fours with amendments Nos. 29 and 56.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I subscribe to the arguments of the honourable Members for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) and for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) about the way in which the difficulties that have arisen in the long-term disposition of Scottish Homes' landlord function that it will inherit from the SSHA have been dealt with, first, in the consultation document, subsequently in the White Paper and now in the Bill. The end result, whether by design or accident, is a great uncertainty in tenants' minds. It is imperative that the Committee try as best it can to plumb the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0340">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>475</span>
depths of the government's thinking about the landlord function of Scottish Homes in the middle term or the longer term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Initially, Scottish Homes, being used predominantly as an enabling and funding body, is quite a different kettle of fish from a Scottish Homes which, in the foreseeable and indefinite future, as far as I can determine from the Bill, will be the second biggest landlord in this country, and a landlord that even seeks to expand its provision. There is a world of difference between an enabling and funding body and a landlord which is a development agency, and which has, almost incidentally, an enabling and funding function.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is confusion in two directions. There is confusion, uncertainty and anxiety in the minds of existing tenants. Of that fact I have no doubt. I do not know to what extent the Government can set fears at rest, but something must be done to reconcile the plethora of statements and the implied if not explicit contradictions in what the Government said during the consultation period, in the White Paper and in the Bill. There is great worry that the Government have not thought it through properly and that, at the same time, behind closed doors, they may be hatching plans that they are not prepared to divulge. One may dream up schemes that have a major impact on existing SSHA tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a genuine and legitimate fear, which I have tried my best to alleviate. It might be a risky business, because I might stir up problems for myself in seeking to put people's minds at rest. The Government owe us more explanation than has so far been forthcoming about how they got themselves into this mess by producing many seemingly contradictory statements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are sitting on their hands and seem to be unwilling to come forward with anything better than the Secretary of State's Second Reading statements. There is great uncertainly in existing SSHA tenants' minds. That is unacceptable. The Government have a duty to clarify their thinking. The amendment gives them a chance to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from tenants who have a legitimate grouse about the present situation, housing associations may well have been sold a false prospectus about what Scottish Homes could mean to them and to their future development. They had been give a clear idea that Scottish Homes would be the enabling and funding body that would be the focus for future housing development. They had a clear idea of the impact that they might have on their work, but they too, are filled with anxiety and foreboding about being able to achieve what they had hoped to achieve if it is to be in conjunction with a Scottish Homes saddled with such a landlord function. That, again, is a completely different kettle of fish from the format within which they were given to understand they would be expected to work. Indeed, all the statements in the consultation documents and White Papers serve to confuse their idea of what they are expected to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>476</span>
Confusion and uncertainty abound. The future of the landlord division should be clarified. The Government may say that the matter will be decided by the chairman, chief executive and board of Scottish Homes when it is in existence and starts to take decisions. It may be open to Scottish Homes to decide not to have a monolithic landlord framework and to split it into all sorts of little landlord functions. Such action will have a dramatic impact on the function and role of housing associations within Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
High stakes are involved in how Scottish Homes works out in the long run. The Government must have some idea of the direction in which they expect Scottish Homes to move. It is not right simply to say that it is a problem that Scottish Homes will inherit and will need to resolve to the best of its ability. It is fundamental to the future work and role of Scottish Homes have a clear idea of what the Government expect it to do with the function that it will inherit from the SSHA. It is an important matter. I hope that the Government will give us a clearer idea now than they were able to give us previously; otherwise, the uncertainty will perfectly legitimately continue in the minds of tenants and housing associations. It will be unsatisfactory if there is no clarification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to respond. The honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) was incorrect in everything that he said about the amendment. There is no element of compulsion. All SSHA tenants will continue to live in the same houses, managed by the same staff, and with their rents determined in a similar way to the present arrangements. The honourable Member said that it will change people's lives. There will be no change unless they so wish. The Bill introduces new rights, opportunities and choices for tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for East Lothina used precisely the same argument that was advanced by Labour Members a few years ago in regard to tenants' rights legislation. The Labour party fought against Scottish tenants having tenants' rights. We sat up throughout the night to make certain that the rights that SSHA tenants want to see honoured and which will be honoured, are those for which my right honourable and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland fought throughout the passage of the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that we have touched a raw nerve.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For precisely the same reason that we did not give a ballot to all Scottish tenants on whether they would like the right to buy. I remind the honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) that, at the time, honourable Members said that there was no demand for it. We now know that 106,000 public tenants have exercised the right to buy. That figure is considerably
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0341">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>477</span>
larger than the united majorities of all honourable Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister spoke of demand. He knows that there is a huge demand by SSHA tenants for such a ballot. Why does he not concede their right to a ballot? He gives ballots to trade unionists and others when he thinks that he can win. Why can he not give ballots when he is frightened that he may lose?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman led me neatly to my next point, namely, the disgraceful scaremongering campaign that was exercised against SSHA tenants. I show the Committee a picture that was distributed to SSHA tenants, showing tenants being forced out of their houses. No wonder tenants were extremely worried and concerned. It was distributed—[Honourable Members: "By whom?"]—I shall show the document to honourable Members. It states that it is published by NALGO, SSHA Branch. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Tenants would be hustled and badgered into forming housing associations, tenants co-ops etc."</p></blockquote>
That is not true. In due course, tenants will have further opportunities with increased rights and elements of choice throughout Scotland. We have most to offer to those parts of Scotland where the peripheral estates are run down and where the tenants are dissatisfied. Professor Duncan Maclennan pointed out that in one of the surveys by Glasgow district council, 55 per cent. of the tenants indicated that they were not satisfied with the repairs that had been carried out. Where there is dissatisfaction and where there are serious problems in an area, the expertise of the SSHA is invaluable. We intend to make certain that that expertise is available to tenants throughout Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Adam Ingram 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Kilbride)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister say when the leaflet was distributed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the summer.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is being uncharacteristically devious. He will recall that during the summer, when the leaflet was circulating, the Government had published their original consultation document—what might appropriately be called the blue paper—on Scottish Homes, written by the late lamented Earl of Ancram. At that stage major changes were proposed in the tenure structure for SSHA tenants. Now the Minister is saying that there will be no change in the tenure of SSHA tenants. Can he assure us that there will not be a third or fourth change of mind by the Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman clearly has not read the White Paper which says, under "Tenants' rights" in 2.7:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Scottish Homes will continue the existing role of the SSHA as a model landlord in relation to its own stock, with particular
	<span class='label label-info column'>478</span>
emphasis on developing greater choice for its tenants and offering them opportunities to adopt different management or ownership arrangements which will allow them to enjoy improved services, better housing conditions or greater control of their housing."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When was that published?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A great many tenmants may not have read the consultation document, but I am sure that they read the leaflet distributed to them which contained a crude drawing of tenants being forced out of their homes. It was designed to frighten them and it certainly did so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letters which I received from worried tenants, many of them elderly and sick, did not refer to the wording of the consultation document. They referred to the desperate fear that the advent of Scottish Homes would mean that they would be thrown out of their homes so that the houses could be sold. I hope that the people responsible for that original leaflet and for the continuing stream of misinformation since then have the grace to be ashamed of spreading fear among tenants for no good purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right honourable and learned Friend the Secretary of State and I have done what we can to reassure tenants. At the request of the National Federation of SSHA Tenants, my right honourable and learned Friend wrote a letter spelling out that SSHA tenants will, when they transfer to Scottish Homes, continue to be secure tenants with all the rights that they now enjoy. Indeed, they will have increased rights as a consequence of Part III of the Bill. As I told the honourable Member for Dundee, East, they will continue to live in the same houses, managed by the same staff and with their rents determined in a similar way to the present arrangements. Those are very clear assurances and the SSHA took the decision to send a copy of that letter to all its tenants. In view of the fact that nothing will change for SSHA tenants who are happy with the SSHA, other than a change of name, there is no need for a ballot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are in any case strong arguments against the proposal that the inclusion of the SSHA in Scottish Homes should depend solely on the views of SSHA tenants. Scottish Homes is intended to benefit a great many more people than existing SSHA tenants and it would be indefensible for SSHA tenants to have a right of veto over the opportunities that Scottish Homes offers other tenants throughout Scotland to obtain improvements in housing conditions, and renewal where the problems are most severe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This loss of opportunity would be the result of leaving the SSHA out of Scottish Homes, because the new body needs that expertise which the SSHA has accumulated over 50 years as one of Scotland's best public sector landlords to enable it to work with local authorities and others on the regeneration of rundown public sector housing. We need those management skills that have benefited SSHA tenants
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0342">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>479</span>
to help other tenants, but without taking them away from SSHA tenants, and the only way to do this is to include the SSHA within Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise this point by detailing what we are doing in preparation for Scottish Homes. As part of the Government's wish to stimulate the regeneration of rundown urban areas, we are encouraging initiatives in Scotland by all housing agencies, including local authorities, to upgrade and revitalise our rented housing stock. In particular, we want both the Scottish Special Housing Association and the Housing Corporation in Scotland to put forward proposals for developing housing, whether in tenements or in peripheral and other estates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the current financial year we are targeting this objective more specifically, making available an additional capital allocation of £2 million to the SSHA to acquire from Glasgow district council, by agreement, some local authority stock. I was glad to learn that, after negotiation with the tenants, the district council recently agreed to sell about 1,000 houses in its Castlemilk estate to SSHA for future development, both for upgrading existing tenants' houses and for some diversification of tenure in the future. Those tenants participating in the transfer will retain all the rights they have as tenants of Glasgow district council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the detailed arrangements for the sale of the houses have still to be finalised. The association will thereafter submit outline proposals for development to the Scottish Development Department and more detailed plans will be drawn up after consultation with existing tenants and in conjunction with the district council, the Housing Corporation in Scotland and the Scottish Development Agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a very exciting project for Castlemilk and I was glad to learn how positively the existing tenants have welcomed it. We shall look to this project to demonstrate for the future how a number of agencies acting together can co-operate in upgrading housing and related serve to provide a better quality of life for residents in part of a large peripheral estate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not disagree with the work that is being done, but it is puzzling that in the course of these developments the Government seem to be increasing the size of Scottish Homes as a public sector landlord. The Ministry has just said that whole new tracts of Castlemilk are being taken into ownership by Scottish Homes, but earlier seemed to express the hope that Scottish Homes would divest itself of many of those tenancies—admittedly in ways that were not made clear. This seems to be going against that general drift of principle as adumbrated by the Minister's Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of my first acts as a new Minister was to go to Castlemilk to see the serious problems at first hand. There is a lack of sufficient employment opportunities, and of adequate shopping facilities. A substantial development of this kind could greatly assist with employment prospect and with the co-operation of
	<span class='label label-info column'>480</span>
other agencies. One of the lessons we learnt from GEAR was that an integrated approach will achieve an immense amount. We believe in extending choice and opportunity to tenants, and that will also come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) asked about the views of the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations and the housing association movement, which regarded Scottish Homes as an enabling body. I realise that in my statement I may have fuelled the anxiety that Scottish Homes might be dominated by the legacy of the SSHA to the detriment of the equally valuable contribution that the Housing Corporation will bring to Scottish Homes. Perhaps I can allay that anxiety by illustrating the contribution that we are encouraging the Housing Corporation to make already to the problems of regeneration in run-down public sector estates. Since 1986–87 the Government have made available to the Housing Corporation additional funding specifically to assist the renovation of houses by tenant co-operatives. This additional funding has risen steadily, from £4 million last year to £6.5 million this year, and it will be just over £9 million next year. The first fruits of this programme have all been in Glasgow, where the Calvay, Castlemilk East and Broomhouse co-operatives have got off the ground by this route. We and the Housing Corporation are now responding to demand from outside Glasgow. Funding has already been approved for co-operatives involving 200 houses in the Niddriehouse area of Craigmillar in Edinburgh; 150 houses in the Hunter valley area of Perth and 172 houses in Ferguslie park in Paisley, which I visited last summer. This is in addition to a 70 house extension to the Castlemilk East co-operative in Glasgow and to other proposals that are still under consideration. Last week proposals were announced for a 240 house co-operative in the Ormiston crescent area of the Whitfield estate in Dundee—this will be of particular interest to the honourable Member for Dundee, East.

	<br><blockquote><p>"£6.5 million co-operative project to stop vandalism, break-ins and muggings".</p></blockquote>
The article—a well-written one—is by Mr. James Rougvie. It says that the cooperative
	<br><blockquote><p>"is an attempt to stop the vandalism, break-ins and muggings that have marked the decline of a one-radical housing experiment."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the co-op approached the Government backed Housing Corporation, which has indicated it will provide £6.5 million grant, almost 100 per cent, towards the scheme."</p></blockquote>
We are now considering those proposals, which rest on £6.5 million grant funding over three years from the Housing Corporation, and I will announce a decision soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Housing Corporation has played a vital role in stimulating the development of ownership co-operatives, as is illustrated by the fact that it is involved in the funding of all but by the fact that three such co-operatives in Scotland. Government funding is being channelled in through improvement and repair grants.

	<span class='label label-info column'>481</span>
The skills inherited from both the Housing Corporation and the SSHA will be vital to Scottish Homes' role in the regeneration of run-down public sector housing. Scottish Homes would be severely weakened by the absence of either of its halves. Removing the SSHA from Scottish Homes would deny hope and opportunity to large numbers of people who are not SSHA tenants. I am sure that SSHA tenants would not wish to refuse to share the benefits of the SSHA's managment skills with others, but the basic point is that they cannot have any right to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must ask the honourable Gentleman to withdraw his amendment, failing which I must ask the Committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was disappointed that the Minister did not say anything about what he expects to happen to the size of the landlord division of Scottish Homes. I would have expected him to say that it would be eroded by the natural process that he expects will take place. Whether it will remains to be seen. It is a question of fact and circumstances and history will tell. But he must have some idea whether the number of tenancies that are administered by the SSHA will decline, remain static or, if he continues buying bigger tracts of Castlemilk, even increasing in future. He must have a view about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed that he said nothing about it. I want to press him, if only for an inclination. He may have no plans; he may not have given the matter a minutes' thought. Will he do so now, and share his thoughts with us?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to raise one or two points in relation to what the Minister said. First, he held the leaflet in his hand, about six inches from his face, so that no Labour Member could see what was written. He did not explain to the Committee the context in which the leaflet had been issued—whether it was in response to the consultation document. As he should know, if he had read it, the consultation document suggested that the transfer to landlord arrangements for Scottish Homes should be a transitional stage and that Scottish Homes should, as a matter of priority, get rid of the 85,000 SSHA tenants into another kind of tenancy in the privat sector, or a co-operative. It is in that context that I believe the NALGO leaflet was issued, and not in response to the later proposals. It seems that the Minister tried to mislead the Committee by his remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More importantly, the Minister assured me that the SSHA tenants transferred to Scottish Homes would live in the same houses under the same conditions as they enjoy now. That begs the question of the transitional stage. If the Government back down because they accept that the idea of Scottish Homes divesting itself of these tenants and tenancies was a bad idea, and that the way forward is for Scottish Homes to go from 85,000 houses to 100,000, 150,000, or even 200,000 houses—Shelter called it a huge bureaucratic centralised landlord division, with hundreds of thousands of houses in Scotand—that is the only way in which SSHA tenants can be assured of
	<span class='label label-info column'>482</span>
living in the same houses under the same conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government are against that, and want to run down the landlord division, the suggestion is that tenants will not have the same tenancy rights, but will move to some other form of tenancy, which will change and weaken those rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is convinced that he is offering greater choice to the peripheral estates, to reassure tenants, why does he not give them a ballot? When district council tenants agreed to go to the SSHA, they agreed to go after negotiation. But SSHA tenants have not agreed, and want a ballot. The Minister cannot get agreement from them. He should offer them a ballot. On the result of that ballot he could proceed. That is the way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister skirted all round the houses this morning rather than address himself to the central problem. He cannot get the agreement of the tenants; they are not convinced by the reassurances that he has given the Committee. The Committee is not convinced by them. It is vital that the Minister goes no further unless he has the agreement of the SSHA tenants. The price of that agreement is to give them a ballot on the proposals. It is wrong for him to suggest that SSHA tenants cannot have a veto over the rest of Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many very worthy bodies have recommended to the Government that the SSHA be treated separately from the rest of the Scottish Homes' proposals. Scottish Homes can be set up without SSHA. But there is much housing expertise in Scotland outside the SSHA, which could service the new Scottish Homes areas. That will not wash.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's arguments this morning have been despicable. He has denied tenants a right to control their lives. That is the issue; he has not addressed it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my honourable Friend the Minister for Dundee, East, (Mr. McAllion). The arguments that the Minister has advanced this morning are below par and in some respects dishonest. I am sure that my honourable Friends the Members for Glasgow, Rutherglen (Mr. McAvon) and Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) will welcome the new-found interest of Tory Ministers in the housing estates in Castlemilk. It may be worth pointing out to the honourable Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton), before he is too carried away, some relevant points from the statement that he cited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the arrangement that he has been shouting from the roof tops was admired at before Scottish Homes had been set up. That arrangement was initiated by Glasgow district council, which wants to diversify housing tenure within its boundaries and to improve the lot of tenants. Similarly, I understand from my honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East that Dundee district council has been pushing the sort of initiative about which the Minister has been talking. It is not good enough for Tory Ministers to try to steal the clothes of Labour local authorities in Scotland. Labour local authorities are taking the initiatives in spite of the constraints of that have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0344">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>483</span>
been imposed on them by the Government and are trying to make those initiatives work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point that the Minister made in relation to the Castlemilk project was extremely telling. He said that the tenants had agreed to the initiative that was taking place. That is precisely the agreement that he is here denying SSHA tenants. Tenants in Castlemilk have been carried along with the project. They are prepared to consent to it and that is the basis on which such an initiative should go forward. It must be wrong for Government Ministers and mandarins at the Scottish Office to be able to dictate the future management and tenure of houses in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister pulled out of his private office hat an interesting leaflet circulated by NALGO last summer. He described it as a "disgraceful document". If there was any disgraceful document circulating in Scotland last summer, it was the Scottish Homes consultative document—Mr. Ancram's blue paper on Scottish Homes. Paragraph 34 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State has in mind that, on the creation of Scottish Homes, the entire stock of SSHA houses should be transferred, as a holding operation, to a new 'landlord' division of Scottish Homes."</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 35 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Arrangements for a 'landlord' division would be essentially transitional and Scottish Homes would be asked to prepare and implement, as a matter of priority, proposals for new management arrangements for tenanted houses in SSHA estates in different areas of the country."</p></blockquote>
That is what the Government were saying at that time and it is clear that they intended to try to force SSHA homes out of the public sector by various methods. Is it surprising that NALGO and other organisations and SSHA tenants' representatives responded to that challenge and made it clear that they were not prepared to be herded round like chattels of the Government, and that they resisted the proposals? In November, when the White Paper was published—I think that it was a week or a fortnight before the Bill was published—there was a major cave-in on the part of the Government. They climbed down on that important principle, having recognised the force of the arguments and the strength of tenants' feelings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries us is that there is nothing to stop the Secretary of State changing his mind again—he has already changed twice. The Under-Secretary of State, the honourable Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) says that SSHA houses will still have secure tenancies. Sitting tenants will, but what happens with re-lets? Scottish Homes will be a public sector landlord under part II of the Bill, so any re-lets by Scottish Homes would presumably be secure tenancies. But under the directions that the Government will be applying through Scottish Homes, which it will control, there must be legitimate fears that any vacant Scottish Homes houses—in other words, vacant SSHA houses—will be quietly shunted into the so-called private sector and all the vagaries of the assured tenancy system, about which we shall be talking presently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>484</span>
The assurances that the Minister is giving, therefore, are not worth very much. It still remains the Government's intention to break up the SSHA and to force those houses out of the public sector into the private sector. All the bluster that we have heard from the Minister this morning is not worth very much. The tactics and strategy of the Government are still quite clear. Although the Secretary of State for Scotland is trying to kick over the traces on this, 90 per cent. of that NALGO leaflet is perfectly true—that was indeed the basis of the Government's proposals when that leaflet was circulated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is protesting far too much. We are perfectly entitled to be worried about the Government's proposals, and I advise my honourable Friends to vote for the amendment to enable SSHA tenants to ballot on this imporant subject which affects their futures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have heard a number of specious arguments from the Minister this morning, full of sound and fury but signifying nothing. Behind the Minister's statement lies the reality that there have been cuts in housing budgets in Scotland. Glasgow tenants and Glasgow district council have been begging the Minister to support co-operatives and to assist them with funding. It is the Government who have been blocking the tenants' co-operative movement in Glasgow by the cuts in funding during their last two terms of office. Even the Housing Corporation had its money cut, as recently as last year, for Edinburgh and the north and south of Scotland. The Government boasted that they had given it £2 million or £2½ million extra to support something in which they believe, but the money came from elsewhere and from other parts of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government see their priority as trying to divide the tenants and people of Scotland by channelling available money into Glasgow, after starving it of funds in the first place. Money to other areas like Edinburgh, Dundee, Aberdeen and the borders is cut, so that the Government's now ideological view of what was once worth supporting in housing can be fostered and nurtured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have brought housing in Scotland to its knees. Now they pretend to have a solution. It's like robbing a bank and then going along and offering protection. This is also a protection racket. The Minister's words of fighting reassurance will come back to haunt him this afternoon and in later sittings. We know that the diminution of tenants' rights is severe. They will not automatically be able to pass on their properties to their sons or daughters who are living with them. The Government call it an increase in security, but it is the opposite. We know that tenants will face the tearing up of rent agreements, especially if they move from one type of house to another. The Government call that a fair rent and a secure policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has come here today to try to mug the Committee with the new public relations image that the Conservative party, rather than the Civil Service, has taken up. What we are hearing today is a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0345">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>485</span>
catalogue of spurious statistics and data which is not mirrored by reality. If the Minister wants a real challenge, I challenge him to debate with me in Edinburgh the Government's housing expenditure record, which he knows we are not buying. I challenge him also, specifically on the amendment, if he is sure that his policies are the right ones, to give tenants the ballot that the Government would force on any other group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Doran 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister rightly directed the Committee's attention to paragraph 2.7 of the White Paper. Unfortunately, he did not go on to the end of the paragraph the one occasion when he addressed himself to some of the points raised by the Opposition instead of just scaremongering. The final sentence of that paragraph reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Tenants will not be pushed into them against their will"</p></blockquote>
"them" being the Government's new proposals. I am not sure what this statement is supposed to mean. It now seems to be in a vacumm, because the Government are making no attempt to find out the will of the SSHA tenants concerned. Will he explain to me exactly what that sentence means?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The sentence means exactly whats it says. The honourable Gentleman, who is an intelligent man, knows exactly what tenants' choice means. It means that the wishes, desires and aspirations of tenants will be respected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) asked me about the funding. Housing Corporation funding has gone up this year. In 1987–88 was £123 million; in 1988–89 it is £133 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And two or three years ago?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should tell the honourable Gentleman, who is so anxious to have the figures, that under the last Labour Government virtually nothing was spent in comparison, either on improvement grants, about which he makes such a fuss, or for the Housing Corporation. The honourable Gentleman's own Government had one of the worst housing records of any Government in recent history.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member dealt contemptuously with what the Government are doing. He chose not to mention what is happening in Edinburgh, where 200 houses in the Niddriehouse area of Craigmillar are being looked at with a view to setting up a co-operative. I think that that is very good news.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister concede that during every year of the previous Labour Government housing expenditure in Scotland was more than it has been in several crucial years of the past two Conservative Governments? The effect of that has been to cause expenditure on housing in Scotland to plummet, in both the public and private sector—to plunge it into such a sorry state that the Government will now have to spend far more than if they had maintained the level of spending in 1979.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>486</span>
They will have to spend far more now because of their neglect in past years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister gave us the figures for last year, this year and next year. Give us the figures from 1979.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman should know by now that capital investment in housing between 1974 and 1979 decreased in real terms by a figure of more than 30 per cent. In real terms, in capital investment in housing under the Conservative Government there has been an increase of 14 per cent. since 1979. The record of the honourable Gentleman's own party is appalling by comparison with that of the Conservative Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to respond to the smiles of Government Members.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have got the honourable Gentleman's point; it is interesting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

They have got as far away from housing as they possibly can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the honourable Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Doulgas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to the honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion). The honourable Member for Edinburgh, South is able to defined himself without the assistance of the honourable Member for Dundee, East. The honourable Gentleman made his speech about animals, but we will now get back to housing. In terms of what he said about the NALGO leaflet, there was absolutely nothing in the consultation document about putting tenants out on the streets, as NALGO well knew. Tenancy rights are guaranteed by clause 3(2) of the Bill; as well as that, all SSHA staff are being offered jobs within Scottish Homes. One of the first things that I did as a new Minister in the summer was to make certain that that would be the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) asked about the size of the landlord division. That depends on tenants' choice, and their wishes and aspirations. The Government wholeheartedly reject the politics of paternalism—that only the local authority knows best. It is the individual who must decide, after considering the options that are put before him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0346">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The worst aspect of paternalism is to say that the Minister knows what is best for tenants. The Minister says: "I know better than they do, I will tell them that they do not need a ballot, because I am giving them assurances".

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How are we expected to take the word of Ministers when we know that the Secretary of State for Scotland wrote the foreword to which I referred earlier in the debate, when the Secretary of State had already taken the decision to abolish the SSHA.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Honourable Members cannot escape the basic reality that it was this Government, this party, that brought in the Tenants Rights Etc. (Scotland) Act 1980, which established the very rights that every SSHA tenant wishes to see honoured throughout Scotland. To their eternal shame, Labour Members voted against that Bill at every twist and turn because they were supporting the politics of paternalism. They did not want tenants to have the right of choice. We are fighting for the interests of tenants throughout Scotland. Labour Members are afraid of the Bill because one day its provisions will be seen to be extremely popular in Scotland—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—in just the same way as 106,000 tenants in Scotland have purchased their homes with a discount. When we brought in that Bill we did not know how strong the uptake would be, but we certainly do now, because we have the hard evidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask two brief supplementary questions anent what the Minister was saying in response to my point about the size of landlord provision. My understanding is that if there is no great desire for SSHA tenants to move to other forms of tenancy and the acquisition policy that he has just announced in relation to Castlemilk continues, we may have an increase in the number of tenancies under the management—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Is it in order for the Secretary of State to scuttle out of the Committee when we were expecting important answers from him?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman knows that that is not a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It possible that in those circumstances for the number of tenancies under the
	<span class='label label-info column'>488</span>
administration of Scottish Homes to increase? Secondly, am I right in assuming that Scottish Homes has the power, although it may not be directed to use it, to divide the landlord division into constituent parts?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It depends first on the choice of tenants. I cannot predetermine or give an estimate of exactly how that choice will work out in future. The numbers might increase in the short term, but we would envisage—and this is only an estimate—that over the years the numbers will reduce. If that happens, as I believe it will, it will be at a pace set by the tenants' wishes to take up new opportunities in due course. My assessment is that the take up will probably be greatest in those ares that have the greatest problems, where it will be seen that the proposals have a great deal to offer those directly concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, the SSHA management has offices throughout Scotland. Obviously, Scottish Homes will have to respond to new priorities and new demands. That is why we have deliberately written into the Bill flexible provisions, so that they can respond rapidly to new priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I strongly support the bringing together of the Scottish Special Housing Association and the Housing Corporation. Before Opposition Members wax too eloquent, I remind them of what the honourable Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said on Second Reading:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I do not object to the concept of putting together the SSHA and the Housing Corporation… There is indeed a case for reform".—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 11 January 1988; Vol. 125, c. 58.]</p></blockquote>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He said it on Second Reading.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the Minister would do that. We shall come back to the principle of the abolition of the SSHA on clause stand part, and I look forward to putting the Minister right on exactly what my honourable Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said, because he has not quoted him accurately, and that is in keeping with the tenor of this debate. I shall not say that I am disappointed by the Minister's reply, which was more or less what we had been led to expect. He has come out with doctrinaire rubbish about tenants' choice, but the Government are once again overlooking the real priorities in Scottish housing policy that we should be considering. There is a crisis in Scotland: 30,000 people become homeless every year, 200,000 people are on waiting lists and a quarter of our population is in overcrowded accommodation. Yet the Government come forward with irrelevant slop like this.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the honourable Gentleman was sufficiently presumptious to question the accuracy of the statement made by the honourable Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), I shall quote again what the honourable Gentleman said.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment seeks to prevent the SSHA's existing loan debt, which I am sure the Committee will be interested to know stands at nearly £600 million, from being transferred to Scottish Homes under the Bill. The justification for the amendment is that, under the Bill, Scottish Homes will take over nearly £600 million of outstanding loans which the SSHA has from National Loans Fund. That in itself is a matter of concern. However, I want to draw the Committee's attention, as the honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) did in passing, to the contents of the report produced by the National
	<span class='label label-info column'>490</span>
Audit Office on the SSHA in December 1986. The first quotation speaks for itself. On page 14 of that report the NAO said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Association has told NAO that it is very concerned at its overall financial position. NAO shares this concern, given in particular the Association's views on the heavy future demands of house maintenance and modernisation and the squeeze on the amount of finance likely to be available as a resutl of the combined effect of high loan charges, the limited scope for increasing rents and the fixed annual limit on the Revenue Deficit Subsidy."</p></blockquote>
That report is even more worrying when one considers that it also said that in 1985–86 repayment of borrowings consumed 96 per cent. of the SSHA's rental income and that that position was likely to deteriorate as the association's rental base contracted. That will inevitably happen because of the continued sale of SSHA houses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and Kinross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is to happen to the liabilities and obligations if we agree to the amendment? We cannot just leave the unfortunate creditors in the air.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had intended to come to that point at the end of my remarks, but I can deal with it just as easily now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the first instance this is a probing amendment. I want members of the Committee to understand what the financial circumstances are. There is at least a prime facie case for the Government to write off the debt. I understand that £600 million is a significant sum of money in anybody's language and neither the National Loans Fund or anyone else, can be left to pick up the financial consequences: the Government would have to find the money. I accept that £600 million is a significant sum, but there are all sorts of ways in which the debt could even be mitigated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want the Committee to consider this morning the extent of the debt and the implications that it will inevitably have for the future work of Scottish Homes. However, there is at least an initial case for wiping off the debt, and I want to put that proposition squarely to the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other worrying fact that the National Audit Office report threw up is illustrated in my second quotation from page 14 of the report. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the SSHA has calculated that, in order to implement its identified programme of modernisation and maintenance work on its existing houses, it will need to spend £735 million, at 1985 prices, over the next ten years".</p></blockquote>
That is £73 million a year over the next 10 years. The report goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"this is £215 million more than would be available from the Association's current level of capital and revenue funding".</p></blockquote>
I am seeking to explain to the Committee that the SSHA, which is being incorporated in Scottish Homes under the Bill, is facing many financial problems in both capital and revenue. That surely will have a serious effect on the development of Scottish Homes, as there will be pressure from its landlord division to concentrate its resources on the maintenance and modernisation of its own stock, acccording to its plans. That problem would be alleviated if 96 per cent. of rental income, instead of being devoted to loan repayments, was available for carrying out repair and maintenance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0348">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>491</span>
In these circumstances—I put it no higher—we should at least consider whether it would be desirable to take the opportunity of the formation of Scottish Homes to write off their substantial SSHA debt instead of burdening Scottish Homes with it from the outset and perhaps stymying many of its best efforts. It would be better if it were given an unfettered financial birth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are also concerned about the millstone around the new body's neck. The honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) rightly referred to the £600 million of existing loan debt, but that is not all that Scottish Homes will acquire. It will also inherit any debt which is the liability of the Housing Corporation for Scotland. In its last annual report, the total shown in advances from the national loans fund is £2,16,223,000, but that is not broken down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be interested to know how much of that will accrue to Scotland. I raise the point now by way of early warning, I hope to raise it in the discussion on clause 9, which attempts to limit the borrowing of the new authority to £1 billion in the first instance and thereafter by authority of the Secretary of State to £1.5 billion. It is important to know what the total loan debt of the new body will be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I echo the points made by my honourable Friends the Members for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) and Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) about this financial disaster for the SSHA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter has to be resolved because Scottish Homes cannot embark on its career if it is lumbered with £600 million of debts, when every penny piece of the rents paid by tenants goes towards servicing loan charges. We hope that we shall hear from the Minister about that, if not a on this amendment, but in relation to clause 9.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 30 would protect the rights of local authorities to exercise nomination rights for SSHA houses, which are an extremely valuable resource for many local authorities. We have said a great deal about the serous problems of lengthening waiting lists for local authority houses in Scotland. A valuable alternative that local authorities can use is to nominate prospective tenants from their waiting lists to vacant SSHA houses. In my constituency COSLA has been kind enough to give us a list of the significant number of different local authorities that are able to take advantage of these facilities. They include Aberdeen, the Western Isles, Dunfermline, Inverclyde, Renfrew, Ettrick and Lauderdale. If local authorities are not to have access to relets by Scottish Homes, that is likely to aggravate the waiting lists in those areas. I hope that the Minister will give us reassurances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the last point made by the honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) is that there will be no change in nomination rights. Amendment No. 30 is unnecessary. Scottish Homes will inherit all
	<span class='label label-info column'>492</span>
agreements that the SSHA currently has with local authorities or anyone else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will they be legally binding?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the position. There will be no change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) raised the matter of the £570 million debt. If that sum were written off, the money would have to be raised from taxation, the Scottish block or somewhere else. It cannot be written off just like that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments deal with the degree to which Scottish Homes, following its establishment, would be in the same position as the SSHA, in financial and non-financial terms. Amendment No. 114 goes well wide of what I understand from the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, and from the material supplied to members of the Committee by the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, to be its purpose. This is illustrated by the fact that it runs counter to amendment No. 30 and by the obvious disadvantages of the proposition that Scottish Homes should not be bound by any of the SSHA's obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea that the Government should write off the £570 million of loan debt to Scottish Homes at the outset rests on a number of misconceptions. The SSHA at present copes quite comfortably with its debt. Its rent income exceeds its debt payments, and if the world stood still in terms of capital spending, the SSHA's debt would diminish steadily because the average price at which houses are being sold is well above the average debt per house. The average selling price of SSHA houses is £11,390. That is £4,390 more than the average loan debt per house. On average, therefore, every house sold by the SSHA generates a profit of £4,390, which reduces the costs fallng on the remaining tenants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that the average selling price is approximately £11,000. Is that the valuation of the property or the average discounted price? In other words, is that the money that the SSHA actually receives?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To the best of my knowledge, that is the discounted price, but if I am wrong I will inform the honourable Gentleman later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are issues, on which the Public Accounts Committee has touched, about the financing of future capital works on the SSHA's stocks. The honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) mentioned the NAO report. It is important to stress the Public Accounts Committe's view rather than those of the National Audit Office, on which the SFHA rely. The PAC report, published three months ago, is more up to date than the NAO report, now a year old, and takes into account additional evidence on the relevant matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would not affect the financing of future works. Part of the answer is that capital receipts from house sales enable some new capital spending to be financed without borrowing and the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0349">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>493</span>
very high levels of sales now being experienced by the SSHA are important in this respect. Where future capital expenditure has to be financed by borrowing, the loan charges will have to be met either from rent income or from the subsidy paid by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since a substantial deficit grant subsidy of £23.3 million, rising to £24.4 million next year, is paid at present on that part of the SSHA's management and maintenance expenditure, which exceeds the rent income left over after meeting borrowing costs, any additional costs, including costs arising from new borrowing, will effectively be borne by the deficit subsidy. An equivalent to the deficit subsidy will be included in the grant-in-aid paid to Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A related point was raised with me on Saturday in Glasgow at the conference for tenants' representatives organised by Shelter and the Scottish Tenants Organisation. It related to the borrowing costs arising from this year's additional £2 million capital expenditure for Castlemilk and the effect of that expenditure on rents. It may be useful to take those costs as an example of expenditure that will be met by deficit subsidy. The relevant borrowing costs are one of the factors that have contributed to the £1.1 million increase in subsidy next year compared with this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the arguments advanced for amendment No. 114, the suggestion by the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations' that all the SSHA's income should be spent on management and maintenance is seriously misconceived, and for this reason. Rent income for 1988–89 will be more than three times management and maintenance expenditure. The scope for greatly multiplied revenue spending on what are acknowledged to be among the best managed and maintained houses in the public sector must be questionable, to say the least.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) asked about the Housing Corporation's debt. That is entirely financed by loan repayments by housing associations. The amount of the debt stands at £172.5 milion but one cannot separate that from consideration of a fully adequate income stream. Whether the debts will be kept separate depends on Scottish Homes internal accounting arrangements, which are not yet decided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that those explanations will assist honourable Gentlemen and that they will not seek to press the amendments, failing which I shall have to ask the Committee to reject them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister did not even make a psassing reference to the increase in management costs per unit as the best housing stock is sold off. This applies to local authorities as well as to the SSHA. I do not see how it is possible to continue to keep such low costs per unit for management because the best stock is being sold, the worst stock is being left and the areas being covered are more difficult to administer. That is a factor on which I expected the Minister to comment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to press him on that. I did not expect
	<span class='label label-info column'>494</span>
him to say this morning, "Here is £570 million for nothing." We shall carefully study what the Minister has said and on that basis I shall beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment, unless the Minister has anything to add to what he has said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I gave the honourable Gentleman an answer in my earlier remarks. The SSHA generates a profit of £4,390 on every house sold, and that reduces the costs falling on the remaining tenants.

	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has already misquoted from the speech that my hounrable Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) made on Second Reading. He will know that we came to the Committee willing to listen to the case for incorporating the Scottish Special Housing Association in the new Scottish Homes centralised agency. I shall give the accurate quotation:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I do not object to the concept of putting together the SSHA and the Housing Corporation. However, I object to the form and the way in which that has been done and to some of the powers that are implied and the script that has been written for Scottish Homes."</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 11 January 1988; Vol. 125, c.58.]</p></blockquote>
When the Minister reads the record of his earlier speech this morning, he will find that he attributed words to my honourable Friend for Garscadden that my honourable Friend never said. The objections to which my honourable Friend referred remain. We have had no assurances from the Government to allay the legitimate fears of tenants of the SSHA and the wider anxieties about the incorporation of those 83,000 houses into the new Scottish Homes organisation. Under those circumstances, I urge my honourable Friends to vote against clause 3.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like other honourable Members, I received a briefing from the Law Society of Scotland on the impact of clause 3, which raises a serious point about the vesting provisions. We must consider this in relation to the sales of what will become former SSHA houses. Clause 3 deems to vest the property in Scottish Homes, and the Law Society points out that in the course of any normal conveyancing transactions, evidence of a proper link in title between Scottish Special Housing Association and Scottish Homes would require to be exhibited. The normal means by which that is done is a notice of title, but if a notice of title is required in every case that has a number of effects. First, it increases the work load and therefore the expense for tenants proposing to buy their homes. Secondly, it becomes complicated if a notice of title is required in every
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0350">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>495</span>
case. Thirdly, it will considerably increase the work load in the register house where the title has to be checked. Those strike me as being serious problems that require to be considered. I simply raise them before the vote—if we are to vote on the clause—so that the Minister can give us his views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society suggests how this problem might be dealt with. It does not see that an amendment to this Bill is necessarily required. It would prefer to see an amendment to the section 3 of the Conveyancing (Scotland) Act 1924 which would allow the insertion of a clause of reduction in a feu writ as well as in a disposition, assignation, discharge or the restriction of a heritable security. I seek the Minister's views on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is exactly the same statutory arrangement as was used in the local government reorganisation in 1973. The Scottish development department has had discussions with the keeper of the registers on these matters, and these are continuing, so I will undertake to look at that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that; it is a point that the Law Society makes in its briefing. The distinction here is that what we were talking about in the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 was a transfer between local authorities. What we have here is increasing disposition to members of the public. That makes a considerable difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall look at that point, which was brought home to me in the summer when I went to Petersburn. Some of the tenants complained about a difficulty in purchasing their houses. In that case, the title had not been granted. This is a legal technicality that must be looked at, and I shall do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 3 provides for the transfer of the properties rights and liabilities ofthe SSHA to Scottish Homes. It is concomitant on the need for Scottish homes to absorb the present responsibilities of the SSHA. It has been apparent during the debates in the Committee that honourable Members are generally in agreement that a single unified agency will have an important role in co-ordinating and encouraging the future regeneration of Scotland's housing. Scottish Homes will offer to those who wish to provide houses, or to improve run-down housing, a single door and a central store of experience from which support, in terms of both funding and advice, may be available. The well-documented past experience and widely acknowledged present expertise of the SSHA make it particularly well qualified for this task. This will be an essential factor in Scottish Homes' ability to carry out such a co-ordinating and enabling role. Therefore, it is important that the SSHA forms part of the new body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause contains a further provision of considerable importance. Subsection (2) confers the right to buy on tenants of Scottish Homes and makes them secure tenants. It is the clear, unequivocal
	<span class='label label-info column'>496</span>
fulfilment of the assurances given to SSHA tenants, that their rights will be undiminished by the advent of Scottish Homes. Clause 3 is central to the composition of Scottish Homes, and I beg to move that it stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Nevertheless, this stand part debate could give the Minister an opportunity to respond to the detailed point covered there, which has come to my attention as a result of a constituency case. I make no apology for raising a constituency case in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, at present members of the management committees of housing associations and their families cannot directly benefit from the housing associations' work. Housing associations specialise in providing for people with special needs, whether it is elderly people or, as in this case, people with mental handicap. A constituent of mine is a member of the Ark housing association committee, and members of her family suffer from mental handicap. She clearly takes an interest in the care of and housing provision for those with mental handicap, but unfortunately her relations cannot benefit from the work that she does. Clearly, she is bringing special expertise to the work of that body and it seems unfair that members of her family should not be able to be considered for tenancies of Ark housing association houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have drawn this point to the attention of the Scottish Office in the past, and it is a fair point. I recognise the need for safeguards and I accept that members of committees should not be able to "look after" their own families—we have heard of similar problems in relation to other areas—but this is surely a special case. I hope that the Minister will take this opportunity to show some sympathy for that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with the remarks of the honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson). May I add another specific point? The rules should allow registered housing associations to purchase property from voluntary committee members at the district valuer's valuation. The honourable Gentleman made the perfectly proper point that volunteers should not be discriminated against by not being able to be considered as prospective tenants. There is also the problem—it is not widespread, but it is nevertheless an acute problem for those whom it affects—of housing associations being denied the ability to acquire, at the district valuer's valuation, premises owned by volunteers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Experience has shown that this has been severely prejudicial to a few well-deserving cases. It is not fair. There is no nepotism, possible fraud or any other
	<span class='label label-info column'>498</span>
conceivable prejudice that could be caused if housing associations were given the power to handle these matters more sensitively in future. I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity provided by the Bill to consider both situations and come up with a solution to obviate the difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is obviously a serious matter that should be examined. It is likely that the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations will come up with a new clause. If it does, I suggest that we debate it thoroughly. In the past in certain parts of Great Britain, although not especially in Scotland, there have been abuses which have given rise to the present circumstances. Perhaps we may consider that carefully when the new clause is debated in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite its length and detail, schedule 3 has but one function. It amends part I of the Housing Associations Act 1985 which deals with the registration and supervision of housing associations to enable Scottish Homes to carry out in Scotland the full range of functions now undertaken by the Housing Corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

It is an important provision which enables the necessary degree of central control over Scottish Homes' activities.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we had more time, we could have a wonderful debate on the classic amendment,
	<br><blockquote><p>"leave out 'may' and insert 'shall'".</p></blockquote>
This brief clause provides the Government grants to Scottish Homes. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may, with the consent of the Treasury, make such grants to Scottish Homes as appear to him to be required to enable Scottish Homes to meet the expenses it incurs in the exercise of its general functions and powers."</p></blockquote>
He "may" make such funds available. There is a certain contradiction in that. Scottish Homes will have the job of finding out what money needs to be spent on the provision of housing, but it may not get sufficient funds to carry out the duites laid on it by Parliament. The Committee would like some undertaking from the Government that sufficient funds will be made available in any given year to enable Scottish Homes to carry out those duties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have always made it clear that I envisage Scottish Homes as a strongly resourced body, and nothing that I have said has been to the contrary. I also envisage it as being strongly involved in urban regeneration. I do not need to delay the Committee for long on the clause. It provides the necessary power for the Secretary of State to make grants to Scottish Homes to cover the expenses that it merits in the exercise of its general functions and powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two major components of the expenditure by Scottish Homes are continuing expenditure on the management of the estate that it inherits from the Scottish Special Housing Association, and the programme of grant assistance to registered housing associations. The remainder will be for the activities which are new to Scottish Homes, including support to those providing housing and the promotion of local economic and environmental improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause provides a grant-making power which can be used to support all Scottish Homes' activities. It is not unfettered. The Secretary of State may make grants subject to conditions, as provided for by subsection (2). In addition, he may control the way in which Scottish Homes operates financially by determination under clause 5. There is also a general
	<span class='label label-info column'>500</span>
power of direction available to the Secretary of State under clause 2(9).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The combination of the various powers of direction and the general nature of the grant-making power will give a proper balance between flexibility and control in turning Scottish Homes to new tasks and problems. I cannot at this stage foresee the precise level of grant that will be made available to Scottish Homes, but it will be strongly resourced. It will receive funding appropriate to its major tasks, but precise decisions will be made at the normal time, at the close of the annual public expenditure survey exercise in the autumn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Special Housing Association and the Housing Corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his response to my last question, the Minister said that the new body would acquire total outstanding debt liability of some £772.5 million. As the clause stands without any further order by the Secretary of State, that leaves Scottish Homes the borrowing capacity of an additional £227 million approximately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are used to being given an idea of the time scale within which it is expected that that borrowing limit will apply. For example, the Minister has been using the analogy with the Scottish Development Agency, and, if I recall correctly, the recent Bill attempted to project its borrowing requirements for the next five to seven years. How long does the Minister see this borrowing requirement subsisting?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can best explain the position by making it clear that Parliament has the option of extending the limits, should it so desire. I cannot give a precise time scale because I do not know how quick funds will be used on specific projects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having approved in clauses 7 and 8 the borrowing and guarantee powers related to Scottish Homes, in clause 9 we turn to the limit on how much borrowing Scottish Homes may incur. Clause 9(1) defines which elements of Scottish Homes' borrowing count towards the overall limit and provides that the total must not exceed £1,000 million. The Secretary of State has power to increase that amount to no more than £1,500 million by making an order which is subject to the approval of this House. Clause 9(3) provides that interest outstanding should count towards the total borrowing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right that the borrowing of a body such as Scottish Homes should be subject to proper control and for increases to be subject to scrutiny by Parliament. The clause provides for both.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish Homes will, of course, inherit the current borrowings of both the Scottish Special Housing Association and the Housing Corporation. We discussed that of the SSHA when we examined clause 3. Its borrowings arising from its long and substantial programme amount to £571 million. The nature of the Housing Corporation's borrowings is different in that it lends on to registered housing associations and borrows to cover that lending. The borrowing is repaid by the housing associations, but at any time there are unrepaid loans, currently amounting to £172.5 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The limit on borrowings at £1,000 million gives Scottish Homes adequate room for manoeuvre. If there is a need to go beyond that limit, Parliament has the opportunity to debate it and come to a speedy conclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister unable to give a time scale? Presumably the Government have certain plans in this respect and they will know what projected expenditure the new authority is likely to have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>502</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At present the borrowing limit leaves Scottish Homes with scope to borrow more than £250 million, which is a considerable sum. That is likely to last for several years, bearing in mind that old debts are discharged as well as new debts taken on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How many is several?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said several years. The honourable Gentleman recall the Scottish Development Agency Bill, which we debated at some length. There was a need to extend the borrowing limits, and that is why the SDA Bill was introduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely why I raised the point. The honourable Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Lang) gave us a precise indication of how long he expected the borrowing requirement to subsist. He projected ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to make too heavy weather of it, but it is important not only for Opposition Members but for the new Scottish Homes to know what level of activity is expected of it in years to come. For example, if the side of the Housing Corporation activity that Scottish Homes takes over increases, the funds will be eaten into very quickly because it has no ready income.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reply that I have given answers the honourable Gentleman's point. Scottish Homes is not yet set up; it still has a long way to go, and we are only a third of the way through the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Government withdraw it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly not. I accept the honourable Gentleman's point that it is necessary for the Government to come forward speedily when there is a requirement for them to do so in this connection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister has any doubts about whether Scottish Homes will be set up, he should tell us now rather than later because we could save ourselves a great deal of time. My honourable Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) has pointed out that the financial capacity of Scottish Homes will be severely limited, certainly in the early years. If it is to achieve what the Government say it will be able to achieve, either the SSHA's old debts will have to be written off or it will require a substantially increased borrowing capacity, because the initial £1 billion limit will be largely swallowed up by the existing debts of the SSHA and the Housing Corporation in Scotland. This body will not have massive resources available at the outset to enable it to achieve much, but we shall wait and see.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Most of Scottish Homes' spending will be financed by grant in aid and not by borrowings. The sum of £250 million is quite a wide margin. As I said, if it is necessary for the

	<div class='title'>MISCELLANEOUS FINANCIAL DIRECTIONS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 125, in page 8 line 3, leave out from "excess" to end of line 5 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"to further the discharge of its general functions.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take Government amendment No. 130 and amendment No. 126, in page 8, leave out lines 12 to 15.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 125 has been suggested by the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations. Its purpose is to seek clarification of the precise purpose of the clause and to ensure that any revenue surpluses which accrue to Scottish Homes as a result of an underspend in capital allocation are used to further the general functions of the new agency. That seems a reasonable suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SFHA says that it is not clear about the precise nature of the revenue surpluses with which the clause deals. We should like to be clear whether it relates to an underspend in the finance allocated for the running costs of Scottish Homes or an underspend in the capital allocation made to the agency to further its objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not particularly bothered about the first possibility, but if the clause refers to an underspend in the capital allocation, that suggests that provision is being made for a variation in the current grant redemption fund system. The SFHA believes that it is more appropriate to apply any such surpluses to the general furtherance of the functions of Scottish Homes, which will have, as one of its major responsibilities, the task of addressing the current crisis in Scottish housing to which we have all referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The federation believes that it is appropriate that any revenue surpluses generated by an underspend in the capital allocation made in respect of the housing association programme is reapplied to that programme. That seems a reasonable request, and I hope that the Minister will take account of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>504</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The representations of the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations will certainly be taken into account in this connection. We have discussed several times in the Committee the accountability of Scottish Homes. The intention of the clause is to allow the Secretary of State, if he considers it necessary, to govern the extent to which Scottish Homes may build up reserves and to give it directions on the disposal of its surplus assets. I am sure that we all agree that it is important for the Secretary of State to retain such control over Scottish Homes. Indeed, Government amendment No. 130 strengthens the Secretary of State's control by making it a duty of Scottish Homes to comply with any discretion given under the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is most unlikely that Scottish Homes will, in practice, build up reserves in anything other than highly unusual circumstances. Therefore, this is not a provision which I should expect the Secretary of State to need other than in exceptional circumstances in Scottish Homes' day-to-day running of its financial affairs, but it is important that such a control exists to ensure that Scottish Homes is fully accountable. The provision is precedented in section 94(6) of the Housing Associations Act 1985.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unlikely that Scottish Homes will be required to repay any unspend on running costs or other grant in aid. In general, such overspend will be carried forward to the next year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
