	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to mention that my right honourable and learned Friend the Secretary of State will make sure that tenants are consulted by the development corporations on any sale proposals in advance of wind-up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I want to re-emphasise the main points of our policies on new town housing in advance of the wind-up of the corporations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the period before wind-up, we want to encourage further diversification within the towns. That will help to achieve mature and balanced communities. To help achieve that objective we intend to bring forward to the Committee a proposal to extend the corporations' powers, under the New Towns (Scotland) Act 1968 to sell land and property, subject to the consent of the Secretary of State. Without wishing to anticipate our debate on that, I stress that we expect corporations to use those powers mainly to sell groups of houses to housing associations or tenant co-operatives—in short, to build on the already established network of community housing initiatives in the towns. Clearly, such initiatives will work only if the tenants concerned want to see their homes transferred to a new landlord. I give an unqualified assurance that tenants' views and wishes will be respected in advance of wind-up in any sale proposal that comes before my right honourable and learned friend. Indeed, we hope that the initiative for such disposals will come from the tenants, rather than from the corporations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our proposed extension of corporations' powers of sale will put new towns exactly on a par with Scottish local authorities, which is entirely appropriate as the towns achieve maturity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Adam Ingram 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Kilbride)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The assurance that the Secretary of State will consult tenants of the new towns before taking any decisions rings rather hollow. Representatives are present today from
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0646">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1031</span>
tenants' associations and from the SSHA in the Dumbarton area. They asked to meet the Minister, but he has refused. If he is really prepared to consult tenants in the new towns, he has an ideal opportunity today. If the Government Whip were prepared to adjourn the sitting, the Minister could consult tenants' representatives. That would satisfy me. At the moment, the Minister's assurances ring rather hollow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will the Government go about their consultation with tenants? Will they provide resources for tenants to meet and to form tenants' associations before the promised consultation? That would allow tenants to be properly briefed and advised about the points that they want to discuss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it part of the Government's possible future policy to sell land to the existing district councils as well as to the other organisations that the Minister mentioned within the new towns? If so, is he also prepared to provide resources to those district councils to build much-needed houses on that land?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman has raised a number of points, but I cannot go much beyond what I said earlier. We expect the corporations to use those powers in advance of wind-up mainly to sell groups of houses to housing associations or tenant co-operatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The full mechanism on consultation must be worked out for the review that is to take place. The issues that must be taken into account are the views of the tenants concerned the mix of housing to be sold, how it is related to housing provision in the town as a whole, the financial and professional housing management conference of the body to whom the housing would be sold, the financial terms of the sale and whether they represent good value to taxpayers, and the state of repair and condition of the properties concerned. Land sales to district councils will not be precluded, but we must consider each case on its merits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Gentleman referred to tenants from Dumbarton. I receive many requests for meetings with tenants. As I cannot meet them all, I spoke to the tenants' conference called by Shelter in Glasgow on 6 February to explain our promises to all tenants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Doran 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The tenants here today have taken the trouble to travel to London to listen to the proceedings of the Committee, but the Minister will not take the trouble to meet them. Those tenants have come here because they are interested. They want to see how the Committee works and to let the Minister know their views. They have tried other means to get their voices heard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not good enough for the Minister to say that he has spoken to a conference organised by Shelter in Glasgow as he conveniently scuttled away before he had a chance to hear what the tenants had to say. That says it all in terms of the Government's attitude
	<span class='label label-info column'>1032</span>
to tenants—they are prepared to speak down to the tenants, but not to listen to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My honourable Friend for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram) has spoken eloquently and powerfully on behalf of his new town constituents and on behalf of those living in houses belonging to new town development corporations in the five new towns in Scotland. The Minister has failed to give adequate assurances about the Government's intentions on those houses. There is a clear requirement on new town development corporations at present that when they are dissolved their houses should be passed to the elected local authority for the area. Serious doubts have been raised about the Government's intentions and the Government have confirmed that it will be necessary to introduce further primary legislation if they are to force those houses into another sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we shall have another opportunity to consider the matter, it is important to register the strong feelings of those who represent the majority of people in Scotland, and all the new towns in Scotland, by voting on this issue today. The decision will have to be made by my honourable Friend the Member for East Kilbride, as he moved the amendment, but this is an important point and my inclination and that of the Labout party officially is to support the currently established principle that new town properties should in due course pass to the elected district councils for the area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was waiting to see whether the Minister intended to respond. My inclination is the same as that of my honourable Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson)—to press the amendment to a Division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened carefully to what the Minister has said and I shall read the 	<i>Official Report</i> of our proceedings. The amendments and the new clause simply reaffirm the commitments that Ministers gave to new town tenants in 1984, so I shall be surprised if the Government vote against the amendment. If they do, it means that their assurances amount to nothing and that the Minister's words today merely presage the handing over to the private sector of all new town housing controlled by development corporations. District councils will simply be ignored. That is why I wish to press the amendment to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>No. 290, in page 31, line 14, leave out 'and' and insert "or".</p>
	<p>Government amendment No. 469. amendments No. 573, in clause 57. page 35. line 21, leave out 'of pensionable age' and amendment No. 296. in clause 57, page 35. line 21. at end insert 'or a disabled person'.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The notes on clauses euphemistically state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This clause provides a new right for approved persons to acquire houses from public sector landlords."</p></blockquote>
The "approved persons" are private landlords. Private landlords will get their hands on public sector houses by means of what is just as euphemistically described as "tenants' choice". The clause has nothing to do with rights or choice for tenants and everything to do with providing opportunities to undermine public sector housing in Scotland and transfer it to the private sector. Private sector landlords will be able to profit from the clause, but there are at least some exceptions to the categories of public sector property that can be acquired.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (4) is divided into two paragraphs one of which deals with houses in rural areas. This group of amendments does not deal with that paragraph, but with paragraph (a) which defines houses with special facilities that are exempt. They are houses that have
	<br><blockquote><p>"a call system and the services of a warden"</p></blockquote>
and also houses that are
	<br><blockquote><p>"specially designed or adapted for the needs of persons of pensionable age or disabled persons".</p></blockquote>
I think that the Committee would agree unanimously that those public sector facilities should not be affected by the clause. Private sector landlords should not be allowed to acquire houses that are specifically designed for the elderly or disabled persons—in effect, sheltered housing. It would be intolerable if houses which are in short supply and which meet the needs of a vulnerable and demanding group in society were transferred to the private sector and let not on the basis of need but according to who can pay the most money. Specially designed and adapted houses may then move out of the hands of those for whom they were specifically designed because private
	<span class='label label-info column'>1034</span>
landlords do not consider the needs of applicants but only who is prepared to pay the highest rent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dundee district council has an outstanding record and is second to none in Scotland for providing housing for the elderly and the disabled, but despite that record when I was a regional councillor in Dundee people still had to spend years on the waiting list for sheltered housing. I remember an old lady who was nearly 80 years old and who had such severe arthritis in her legs that she could not climb stairs. Her bathroom and toilet were upstairs and she had been category A priority for years, but she was still years away from access to sheltered housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sheltered housing should be exempt from the provisions of clause 51. The wording of subsection (4) means that other houses—provided by public sector authorities which have different types of support services would not be exempt. Vulnerable groups will be affected such as single persons for whom housing is provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The district council in Dundee has a development at Maybole place in Whitfield which is specifically designed to cater for different types of young single people such as those who have just left home for various reasons. They are faced with the problem of setting up home for the first time. They may rely on social security payments. Even mature people find such circumstances difficult to cope with, so for youngsters they can be overwhelming. There is a warden on site at the unit at Maybole place who provides practical assistance and advice on benefits and so on, and also moral support and assurance to help youngsters through a trying period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Youngsters may not have left home, they may have come out of care where they have spent their childhood up to the age of 16. In care they never have to make decisions because everything is done for them but a thousand and one decisions have to be made to survive in the community. Money has to be put aside for the electricity or gas, the milkman and the rent. The warden helps youngsters through those first critical years. The wording of subsection (4) suggests that that sort of development would not be protected. It also seems to exclude other developments that have been set up by many public sector authorities to provide help to mentally ill and mentally handicapped patients coming out after long-term stays in institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know of developments in Dundee in the ward that I used to represent, in Dunmore street in Kirkton where one close was kept aside for patients coming out of hospital. A janitor lived on the ground floor and there was controlled entry into the tenement. All sorts of help enabled people to get back into the community. It is worrying that developments such as that would not be protected by subsection (4). Subsection (4) only stipulates housing
	<br><blockquote><p>"which is one of a group which has been provided with facilities (including a call system and the services of a warden) specially designed or adapted for the needs of persons of pensionable age or disabled persons".</p></blockquote>
No mention is made of the mentally ill or the mentally handicapped, or of young, single and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0648">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1035</span>
vulnerable people coming out of care or setting up home for the first time. Those groups are particularly at risk and would not be protected under the clause. Under the Bill unscrupulous landlords who wished to get their hands on the type of housing that is provided by public sector authorities may try to influence young people to pick them as a landlord and then exploit the situation. I am sure that that is not the Minister's intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will look at the wording of amendments Nos. 492 and 506. Amendment No. 492 replaces paragraph (a) with
	<br><blockquote><p>"which has services provided or facilities designed or adapted for the needs of persons of pensionable age, disabled persons or other persons with special needs".</p></blockquote>
That would cover the mentally ill, the mentally handicapped and young single people. Amendment No. 506 specifically mentions housing that has
	<br><blockquote><p>"been particularly provided for occupation by single persons or mentally ill or handicapped persons".</p></blockquote>
These amendments are very important because they deal with vulnerable groups of people who deserve to be protected from ruthless private sector landlords. The Minister is keen to promote private sector developments and private sector landlords who will never meet the needs of such people because they are concerned only with allocating houses on the basis of profit. Only the public sector gives priority to the housing needs of the mentally ill, the mentally handicapped and young single people and to sheltered housing for the elderly and disabled. That is why public sector housing should be exempted from the provisions of clause 51.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We keep hoping that the Minister will move, but he is not getting very far. My honourable Friend is right to press the Government to protect specialist accommodation. I want to relate this aspect of the legislation to the Government's failure to honour a pledge given in relation to the Tenants' Rights, Ect. (Scotland) Act 1980, which has been consolidated in the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987. As undertaking was given that specially adapted housing for the disabled and elderly in England and Wales could be excluded from the right to buy. My honourable Friend said that there should be a similar protection from this "trick a tenant" provision. That is a more appropriate description than "pick a landlord", and I commend it to the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood), who said that the term "pick a landlord" was unsuitable. "Trick a tenant" rolls of the tongue nicely. To trick any tenant is bad enough, but to trick an elderly or disabled tenant into accepting a less secure tenancy is even worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government failed to keep their promise to amend the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act 1980 to protect specialist housing. The Minister knows that that caused special problems in Motherwell, because he recently replied to an Adjournment debate raised by my honourable Friend the Member for Motherwell, North (Dr. Reid). My honourable Friend highlighted the fact that housing that had been specially built or adapted for elderly or disabled

My honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) raised an issue pertinent to this aspect of the legislation. We welcome the fact that Scottish local authorities and housing associations are able to construct more specially adapted housing for disabled and elderly people, but we are entitled to issue a warning that if such property is transferred under this legislation it may no longer be available to those for whom it was originally constructed.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The theme of the speech by the honourable Member for Dundee, East was that sheltered housing should be excluded from the right to transfer. Our amendments go some way to meeting that objective. This debate is an extension of an Adjournment debate that I recently held with the honourable Member for Motherwell, North (Dr. Reid) about whether disabled tenants should have the right to buy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendment No. 469 seeks to exempt from the provisions in Part III of the Bill all houses for the elderly or the disabled which are either exempted from the right to buy provisions of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987, or where there is discretion for a local authority to impose a buy-back condition if the right to buy is exercised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me say a little about our thinking on exemptions from tenants' choice. Basically, we see tenants' choice and the right to buy as alternative ways in which the public sector tenant can choose to change his current arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that, so far as possible, the right to buy and tenants' choice should apply to the same tenants. Thus where Parliament has decided to exempt tenants, or houses, from the right to buy, we have sought also to exempt those tenants or houses from tenants' choice. But in the right to buy legislation in part III of The Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 there are a number of cases where the right to buy can be exercised subject to the public sector landlord concerned having a right of pre-emption. In other words, if a house sold under the right to buy is offered for resale, the public sector landlord can have the opton to repurchase the house in advance of its sale to any third party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1038</span>
5 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill at present includes in clause 57 a power for the Secretary of State, if requested by a public sector landlord, to authorise the landlord to refuse an application for tenants's choice if it appears to him that the house has facilities substantially different from those of an ordinary house and has been designed or adapted for occupation by a person of pensionable age whose special needs require accommodation of the kind provided by the house, this corresponds directly to the right to buy exemption in section 69 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987. But under section to buy similar housing for the elderly or for the disabled can impose a pre-emption condition of the type that I have already described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In looking at where tenants' choice could apply, and in seeking, as I have said, to keep these provisions sensibly in line with the right to buy, we considered whether to allow tenants' choice to be exercised with a pre-emption condition or to rule it out altogether. We take the view that any potential new landlord would be unlikely to agree to purchase a public sector house under these tenants' choice provisions if, once the transferring tenant's tenancy ended, the new landlord had to offer back to the original public sector landlord the house which he had acquired. We concluded, therefore, that in cases where the pre-emption right can apply to right to buy sales, tenants' choice should be ruled out completely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendment No. 469 therefore seeks to include within the exemptions from tenants' choice in clause 51 houses which have facilities substantially different from those of an ordinary house and have been designed or adapted for occupation by an elderly or disabled person whose special needs require accommodation of the kind provided by the house. Within the crietria that I have set out, these additional exemptions will bring the tenants' choice provisions as closely as possible into line with those governing the right to buy. Honourable Members may also wish to have advance notice at this point that I will not be seeking to have clause 57 stand part of the Bill as it will be redundant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot advise the Committee to accept the amendments to which the honourable Member for Dundee, east spoke. To a greater or lesser extent they would extend exemptions from tenant's choice beyond the provisions at present in the Bill, and in Government amendment No. 469. at the widest—represented by amendment No. 492—exemptions would extend to all houses, whether in a group or not, which have services provided for, or facilities designed or adapted for the needs of the elderly, disabled or other persons with unspecified special needs. Amendment No. 506 specifically mentions single persons, the mentally ill and the mentally handicapped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made it clear on a number of occasions that the Government's policy is that there should be no unnecessary restriction of tenant's rights. That was the essence of what I said to the honourable Member for Motherwell, North (Dr. Reid) in his Adjournment debate. He pointed out that the right to buy in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0650">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1039</span>
Scotland is marginally different from that south of the border, and he preferred the provisions south of the border. I explained that once a reight has been given it is extremely difficult to take it away. In this case we believe that tenants' choice, like the right to buy, should be available to as many tenants as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments proposed by Opposition Members would mean that any house which had any form of service provided, or which had facilities designed or adapted in any way for the needs of tenants with special needs of any kind, would be exempt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To save my taking up the Committee's lime by speaking to amendments Nos. 288 and 289, perhaps the Minister could comment on them now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those amendments would exclude a slightly larger range of housing than the Government amendment, which referes to facilities which are substantially different from those of an ordinary house and designed or adapted for occupation by a person of pensionable age or a disabled person. Amendment No 289, the widest of those tabled by the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood), would allow houses specially designed or adapted for the needs of the elderly or the disabled to be exempt whether or not their facilities were substantially different from those of an ordinary house. It is a matter of judgment and the honourable Gentleman's amendments go slightly further. We believe tha it is right to keep the provisions in this connection as consistent as possible with the right to buy under the Tenants Rights Etc. (Scotland) Act 1980."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 492 is in effect a wrecking amendment. It takes no great imagination to see that any local authority which is opposed to tenants' rights could, by providing a minimum of "service" to a house, or by making a minimun of adaptations to existing houses or by designing in the minimum of special facilities to a new house or in large-scale modernisations, could effectively ensure that tenants were prevented from exercising tenant's choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our view is that the elderly, the disabled, and those with other special needs should not be further disadvantaged by having their tenants' rights specially restricted in the way that each of the amendments tabled by Oppostion Members would bring about. I therefore ask the committee to reject amendments Nos, 288, 289, 290, 296, 492 506 and 573, but to agree to government amendment No. 496 which gives a limited extention of exemptions to bring the right to buy and tenants' choice provisions sensibly into line. That goes some way to meet the point of the honourable Member for Dundee, East although I recongise that he would wish to go further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We think it is more important that housing should be made available for this particularly vulnerable group of people and that when housing is constructed for that purpose it
	<span class='label label-info column'>1040</span>
should remain available for such people rather than be siphoned off. I suppose that the Government amendments are a fraction of a step in the right direction, but the Minister has confirmed my worst fears by saying that this simply brings the legislation into line with what used to be the Tenants Rights, Etc (Scotland) Act 1980 and is now section 69 of the 1987 Act. That simply means that the situation is the same as it is in connection with the right to buy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has referred, as I have, to the Adjournment debate raised by honourable Friend the Member for Motherwell, North (Dr. Reid) in which he pointed out that the situation in Scotland is not the same as it is in England. The Scottish Office failed to honour a pledge given to the House of Commons in 1980 that the same protection would exist in Scotland as in England in order to protect specially adapted housing stock. The Government amendment simply brings the Bill into line with the right to buy legislation. Recent experience in Motherwell shows that the protection is hopelessly inadequate. Specially adapted property can still be taken out of circulation from the point of view of disabled, handicapped or elderly people. That is an inadequate protection. It is a severe disincentive both to local authorities and to housing associations to provide housing for the disabled. Such housing costs more. What is the point of building expensively adapted housing if the very next year it can be taken out of circulation under this trick a tenant scheme or under the right to buy scheme? This is an inadequate safeguard and I am inclined to advise my honourable Friend the Member for Dundee. East to stick to his guns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is right that the Government amendment does not go far enough as it specifically excludes the kind of examples in Dundee which I have described. With regard to the unit at Maybole place in Whitfield for example, it would be possible for unscrupulous persons in Dundee to approach young tenants in that unit and trick them into giving up their tenancies and moving into private sector housing. There are people in Dundee who would be prepared ruthlessly to exploit the legislation to do that. The same is true of the accommodation which is made available for the mentally ill and the mentally handicapped, which is not covered by the Government amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has a heavy schedule tomorrow in Dundee, when he will meet representatives of Dundee district council. It is insulting of him to suggest that amendment No. 492 is a wrecking amendment, which will allow local authorities throughout Scotland deliberately to undermine tenants' rights. The very idea that local authorities seek to do that shows the gulf of understanding between the Minister and local authorities. The Minister does not understand that they seek to improve tenants' rights and the service to tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It comes ill from the Government to say that they do not want to restrict tenants' choice unnecessarily. Why are tenants in the private sector not given the choice of moving into the public sector? Why are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0651">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1041</span>
tenants in the private sector not given the right to buy from their landlords? Those are unnecessary restricitons, but the Minister is doing nothing about them—or about the mentally ill, the mentally handicapped and the single person developments that I have described and which exist elsewhere than in Dundee. He is prepared for them to be exposed to the activities of ruthless landlords.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"or (c) which is not in the reasonable opinion of the public sector landlord a house for which priority for investment is necessary".</p></blockquote>
This is partly a probing amendment. Subsection (4) rightly states that two of the areas to which the provision does not extend are specially adapted housing with wardens for disabled or senior citizens, and houses in designated rural areas. The amendment seeks to add to those categories houses that have been upgraded and are not a priority for financial investment. We seek to ensure that houses in which local authorities have invested large amounts of money are not handed over lock, stock and barrel to private landlords, who might then be able to make a killing out of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several imaginative schemes exist in Scotland where, in consultation with tenants, money has been poured into housing. For example, in Bingham in Edinburgh the tenants advised the architects on the desirable layout and house type, and houses have been rebuilt at a cost of some £40,000. In Westerhailes in Edinburgh, at Saltan Hall and in many other areas in Scotland, district councils are spending between £10,000 and £20,000 on refurbishing and modernising properties. When the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1042</span>
tenants move back in or become the new owners, they seem perfectly satisfied. Many people have waited decades for such improvements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to exclude such properties in the same way as sheltered housing, housing for the disabled and housing in designated rural areas, so that the investment does not go to waste or line a private landlord's pockets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is unacceptable in principle and in detail. It is technically defective, because it does not define "priority for investment". It is clearly designed as a wrecking amendment. Local authorities opposed to tenants' rights could easily claim—despite the considerable resources that we have made available on the housing revenue account block over the past three years, with an increase of no less than 81 per cent.—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. That is the second time in the past five minutes that the Minister has said that the Committee was debating a wrecking amendment. I am sure that you, as Chairman, would not select wrecking amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No I would not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is certainly wholly unacceptable, because of the problems of definition, but I shall moderate my parliamentary language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a genuine difficulty, although I know what the honourable Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) meant when he spoke about various categories. However, some local authorities may say that all of their housing stock has priority for investment. The practical implications would then be that no tenants could exercise tenants' choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the honourable Gentleman will seek leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it does not seem presumptuous, Mr. Martin, I endorse your decision that this is not a wrecking amendment. The Minister describes it as such because of the phrase "priority for investment", but he and his right honourable and learned Friend the Secretary of State continually tell local authorities that they must have priorities for investment. When I met the Minister last year at St. Andrew's House, we discussed "priorities" and broadly agreed with the private sector about what they were.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I disagree with the Minister that there are difficulties in determining priorities for investment. But even if there were, the tenant and the Minister can consider the meaning of the words "reasonable opinion". It is not merely up to the public sector landlord to decide which houses are a priority for investment. That would indeed be a wrecking amendment. We do not seek to give the public sector landlord the sole determining rights about which houses are priorities for investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0652">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1043</span>
That judgment must be justified and justifiable, through the bid to the Scottish Development Department every year in terms of priority treatment or priorities for funding. All authorities are obliged to complete the priority tables with which the Minister's Department supplies them. It is important that the word "reasonable" stands, but I submit that "reasonable" confers on the local authority a requirement to justify objectively which houses it would designate as being priorities for investment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I really have nothing to add. The same objection obtains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Gentleman mentioned housing being handed over lock, stock and barrel to private landlords. Prices will reflect the conditions of the houses. Landlords will have to be approved by Scottish Homes. The tenant will have to agree to the transfer. The first disposal of properties transferred will have to be approved by Scottish Homes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The key problem is that in modernised and upgraded areas tenants are already falling victim to dishonest publicity campaigns and inducements from companies purporting to offer mortgages to buy council houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Craigentinny area of Edinburgh, for example, many tenants are being offered positive inducements to get into debt and buy their houses through finance companies which stand to make a handsome profit by encouraging people to run up debts and mortgages for a quick, short-term killing. The commission alone might be sufficient in many cases. We have practical experience of that with council house sales. Before modernisation, such companies did not want to know, but after houses had been modernised, at a cost of between £5,000 and £8,000 in the Craigentinny example, the companies came along with inducements to persuade tenants to buy their houses. Without amendment No. 507, that practice might become rife.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tenants may not be given objective information. There is an agency in Edinburgh which purports to be objective, but it is not. A former Conservative councillor worked for it while she was a councillor, and still does, although that does not automatically prove that an agency is not objective. However, it was accepted that that agency was not objective. Financed, I suspect, by the commission from the mortgages being given, it used door-to-door campaigns to persuade people to buy their houses. At least that company was open and honest about what it was doing, to some extent at least. Others are considerably shadier and show no interest in houses that have not been improved, rewired, modernised or had environmental improvements. When such work has been done, those companies move in and in some cases gull the tenants. The majority of tenants are not gulled. Many sit down and take sensible decisions. they consider the matter objectively and decide whether to take advantage of the right to buy. None the less, it suits many of the companies to put undue pressure on people to buy their houses, and get into debt—that is what taking out a mortgage means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1044</span>
Those companies are not above disreputable foot-in-the-door techniques, as well as fairly unsavoury techniques of inducement. We seek to close that door.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Edinburgh, and in many other areas, if a tenant gets into financial difficulty, the council has always been willing to take back the house. The step was never irrevocable, and provided that the tenant was willing to resell the house without making a profit or a loss on it Edinburgh district council, certainly under Labour, has always been willing to take such houses back into the housing stock. The clause will make the step irrevocable. If tenants are gulled into accepting inducements and switching landlords, there is no evidence that they will be able to switch back to the council. That makes it fundamentally different from the right to buy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have one quick question for the Minister. He made an interesting point about the valuation of housing involved in such transactions. It occurs to me that there will be a significant appreciation in the value of a house when it changes from being a house with a sitting secure tenant to being a house with a sitting insecure tenant under an assured tenancy. In other words, the house will increase in value during the transaction. Who will get the benefit of that increase? Will it be the local authority which is being compelled to dispose of the house, will it be the tenant or will it be the speculative landlord who is acquiring it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The sale is at market value. The same objection still applies to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But which market value—the market value with the sitting secure tenant or with the sitting insecure tenant?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the first occasion when the sale is made, it will be at market value, and presumably on the second occasion as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has confirmed that the speculator who acquires the property will get a windfall gain from the additional value that will arise because the property will have an insecure sitting tenant after the transaction has occurred.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not confirm it. It depends on the market.

In the earlier debate, in rebutting a point from the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood), the Minister said that the Government sought to stick as closely as possible to the provisions of the right to buy sections of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987. I hope that this amendment will therefore find favour on the Government side because the exemption that it seeks closely mirrors the right to buy provisions of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987. We are not arguing about the principle of exemptions. The 1987 Act and our earlier debates have made it clear that there are many different exemptions from the legislation that should be, and are, etched onto the Statute Book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment deals with a category of people who are in need and who deserve such an exemption. Our previous debate dealt with specially adapted houses, when the house is substantially different from other houses in a block or area and therefore exempt. The houses that I am discussing are not necessarily specially adapted or substantially different from the other houses in the area. However, they are inhabited by people who for a variety of reasons are vulnerable and sometimes fragile and for whom a sense of community is very important to their wellbeing. They include people with histories of mental illness, drug or alcohol addiction and people who have been in prison or other forms of care and have been released into the community. Some landlords are in the habit of leasing a given number of their houses to such people. Around Scotland there are many communities of vulnerable people whose homes and communities are truly their castles, and they very much depend on those communities. The amendment seeks to exempt from the tenants' choice provisions small groups of houses habitually let by private landlords to vulnerable people. I use the words "vulnerable" and "fragile" not in a pejorative way but to appeal to the Government not to leave the fate of such people to the market.

The honourable Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) has treated us to many illustrations of the halcyon days of the private sector. One is burned forever in the minds of those who know Dundee. The honourable Gentleman went up the Blackie and down the Hackie talking about the wonderful old days of tenements with tiled closes. He painted a picture of the Victorian values of the days when the private sector was kind. Whether those times were golden or not, I think that even Conservative
	<span class='label label-info column'>1046</span>
Members will concede that people with social problems, health problems or undergoing rehabilitation could not find a niche in the housing market and were reduced—as they are still in this country and in many other countries, especially in the third world—to wandering the streets in penury. I am not saying that that is what will happen if the amendment is not accepted, but I hope that the Minister will concede that housing is immensely important to these groups of people. It is often the only rock to which they can cling. The uncertainty of being tossed into a sort of auction when private sector landlords seek to take a whole building or whole neighbourhood out of the public sector will be a deeply unsettling experience for such people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Govenment have already accepted that there should be some exceptions to tenants' choice provisions, some of which we have discussed. The type of people that I have mentioned also deserve to be included in the list of exempt categories. I refer the Minister again to the point that he made to my honourable Friend the Member for Roxburgh and Berkwickshire. As the Government seek to mirror as closely as possible the right to buy provisions of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987, I hope that they will give sympathetic consideration to the amendment, which corresponds to provisions of that Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sympathetic to the purpose of the amendment. The housing association movement caters for some of the categories of persons that the honourable Gentleman mentioned. Not all housing association tenants are covered by tenants' choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I stated previously, the tenants' choice provisions in part III of the Bill are designed to give individual tenants the option of choosing a new landlord. While many of the procedures to be adopted in exercising tenants' choice have been modelled on the right to buy provisions, not all the arrangements under the right to buy are appropriate in tenants' choice—for example, discounts, occupancy requirements, fixed price options, and the like. It would not be appropriate to adopt the wording of amendment No. 544 in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wording of the amendment corresponds exactly to provisions in section 61(4)(f) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 which deal with exceptions to the right to buy. They were originally introduced in the Housing (Scotland) Act 1986. However, those provisions relate to groups of houses owned by registered housing associations. I accept that the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987, which was a consolidating measure, does not clearly state that that is the case, but honourable Members will note that paragraph 1 of schedule 7 to the Bill seeks to clarify that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tenants of registered housing associations will not be able to exercise tenants' choice, as registered housing associations are not public sector landlords for the purposes of the Bill. Therefore, there is no need to exempt from tenants' choice housing of the type that the amendment covers because it is exempted already.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to what the Minister has said. In my experience there is a potential problem with what he proposes. I have experience of an organisation, which is not a housing association—and there is another one in my constituency—which rents property from, among others, the local authority, to house the type of people mentioned in the amendment, in particular the mentally handicapped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice that clause 50 defines a house as including:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a part of a house".</p></blockquote>
I am worried that if a tenant of accommodation intended for "vulnerable" people applied to move into the private sector, the aims of the type of organisation that I have mentioned would be destroyed. There would be no restriction on who could live in that property, whereas if it remained under the control of the voluntary organisation, which is just like any other tenant of the local authority, there would be restrictions. I am worried that people such as wardens may apply to take over. That could usurp the organisations original intentions and their local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This amendment seeks merely to simplify part III of the Bill.

	<p>Government amendment No. 475.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was quite a speech, Mr. Martin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 480, which relates directly to clause 51(5), would make the order-making power relating to exemptions from rural areas mandatory on the Secretary of State. Amendment No. 481 seeks to restrict the definition of rural areas in the context of the Bill. The amendments in my name will be taken with the long string of amendments that you read out a moment ago, Mr. Martin, and it may be worth taking a moment to discuss the questions surrounding rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments which I tabled have a twofold purpose. First, I should like the Government to clarify what a rural area is, and tell us how they will apply these provisions to housing conditions in Scotland's landward areas. Secondly, as I represent a rural area, I seek to exempt rural areas—surprise, surprise—from part III for reasons that I shall explain shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before doing that, I should like to discuss amendment No. 480 in detail, an amendment which the Government could easily accept. It merely requires the Secretary of State to make an exemption order if more than one third of all the so-called relevant houses have been leased outwith the public sector to other landlords under the terms of part III, and the local authority properties have been sold under the tenants' right-to-buy provisions. If more than one third of houses in those categories are outwith local authority control, the Bill
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0655">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1049</span>
as it stands gives the Secretary of State the permissive power to exempt the area from further provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 480 would stiffen that power, and give the Secretary of State no authority in the matter. I cannot imagine many occasions where the Secretary of State would want disposals of leases or sales of council houses to continue beyond the threshold level of one third of the housing stock. If he allowed that, to happen, it would strike fundamentally at the ability of the local authority to have an appropriate management policy for its area. I have made a serious if somewhat minor suggestion, which would not cost the Government much to accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to refer briefly to my pathological objection to negative orders referred to in subsection (6). Some Committee members may believe it appropriate to deal with certain matters under the negative procedure but the sort of issue that comes within subsection (6) should more properly be subject to the affirmative procedure and require the explicit approval of both Houses. That is a particular hobby horse of mine, although I know that not everyone agrees with me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to amendment No. 481, I gave long, hard thought to the different legislative methods available for a low threshold of operation for the Bill in rural areas. It is my opinion that in the regional authority areas covering the Borders, Dumfries and Galloway and the Highlands, part II is not appropriate under any circumstances. I started from that position. I then thought about using the different designations of functions under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, where matters such as planning and building control as well as libraries are handled differently in the Borders, Dumfries and Galloway and the Highlands. I thought at first that that might be an appropriate legislative device by which to exempt Scotland's landward and rural areas, but then realised that it was too vague.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's position is that the burden of the Bill will tackle the problems in the peripheral estates of our larger cities, and I agree that some proposals may have a bearing in those circumstances. But conditions there are a long way removed from what local authorities find happening in landward areas. I thought of stipulating that if a percentage of local authority lets were unoccupied over a certain period—for example, for 5 per cent. or 10 per cent. of the time—the provisions of part III should be brought to bear. But again, I thought that there would be legislative difficulties involved in using that device to get a lower threshold for the implementation of part III in rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I considered the possibility of designating entire districts as rural areas. However, the wording of subsection 4(b) made that difficult. I should not want people designating rural areas that were outwith their own district boundaries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is always worth a try.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be worth a try, but I do not think that it would succeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1050</span>
Finally, I came up with the best method that I could devise—that is, to consider population limits and stock levels which could be negotiated with the Government. Amendment No. 481 designates an area as belonging to the rural exemption category if it has "less than 40,000 people" and if
	<br><blockquote><p>"the number of 'relevant houses' is less than 6,000."</p></blockquote>
I accept that my proposals have their flaws, and may be technically defective. But I am certain that the provisions as they stand are inappropriate to conditions in my constituency. They will not help the local authorities find a positive resolution to some of their difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been much dismay in rural authorities about how the Government have assisted them in managing the strategy in the day-to-day operation of housing policy in rural areas. The way in which the Government have dealt with resourcing, management policies and guidance—or lack of it—that has been available from St. Andrew's House, has led to a sad catalogue of historical problems with which local authorities have had to deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his peregrinations around the airts and pairts north of the border, the Minister must have discovered dismay, particularly in rural areas, about their specific problems. The problems may not be as great as those in the peripheral areas of our great cities, but in their own way they are real and urgent and require specific and even custom-made solutions that are not found in part III.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps we should consider a separate section of legislation to deal with the specific problems facing rural areas, but that may be too cumbersome. If we set up a legislative framework that is tailor made specifically to deal with the problems of peripheral estates, that will serve only to exacerbate the real problems that district and other authorities face when trying to make provision for housing in landward areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) has clearly been agonising for many sleepless nights over the drafting of his detailed amendments. The honourable Gentleman is right to draw attention to the special circumstances in rural Scotland. The problems exist in the furthest reaches of the Borders or the Highlands and Islands and in the rural or semi-rural areas much nearer to our great cities. I know something of those problems because I used to represent a constituency that was considerably more rural than my present one, and the honourable Gentleman inherited the most rural bit of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In small village communities there is a limited amount of housing available to let, especially public sector housing. If a relatively small proportion of those council houses is lost to the public sector, there will be virtually no possibility of people on modest incomes living in those areas getting a house to let. Once the house is taken out of the public sector and goes into the private sector—particularly in the more attractive countryside communities such as Stenton, Gifford, Garvald and Pencaitland in my constituency—they will be bought and sold by people
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0656">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1051</span>
wishing to commute into the town and not by people living and working in the area, who are perhaps on relatively low incomes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A responsible Government trying to operate a responsible housing policy should take action to ensure that housing will be available to let in every part of Scotland. If young families in small villages cannot rent homes there, they will be forced to drift into the towns and cities. The Government's policy is destroying our rural communities. There should be safeguards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us who represent rural or semi-rural constituencies know that people who want to rent houses seek the advice of their Member of Parliament or go to the district council to ask to rent a house. If district councils lose those houses to rent, there is no choice available and people are forced into ghettos in the towns and cities. There is a problem and we should have safeguards. I support the endeavours of the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire in trying to extract safeguards from the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is nonsense to suggest that the Government's policies are destroying rural communities. As honourable Members will know, my constituency covers 2,000 square miles and has many small communities. People living in council houses, whether foresters, gillies, those working in leisure or recreation—as many do—or those engaged in pursuits dealing with the land, were delighted to be given the opportunity to buy their homes. They had no intention of moving anywhere else or of giving up their home, whether they rented or bought it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One must emphasise that the practical policies of this Government, which have, for the first time, given people an opportunity to have a stake in their home, did not change anything. There were no fewer houses on the market. There is no change, and comments to the contrary are theoretical nonsense and scaremongering.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) was right to refer to the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act 1980. Under section 64(6) to (8) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 the Secretary of State can make an order so that, for a rural area where one third of the houses are sold and where he thinks an unreasonable number have been re-sold and are being used as holiday homes, and impose a pre-emption buy-back condition for up to 10 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To try to set that in perspective, I wish to speak to Government amendments No. 471, 472, 473 and 475. Amendments Nos. 471, 472 and 475 relate to rural areas and seek to bring the holiday homes provisions, the tenants' choice arrangements and the right-to-buy provisions of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 as closely as reasonable into line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention of the amendments is twofold. First, they aim to ensure that the calculations of the numbers of former local authority and housing
	<span class='label label-info column'>1052</span>
association houses sold since the relevant right-to-buy provisions came into effect include houses sold other than under the statutory right-to-buy provisions, including these sales. That makes it more likely rather than less that rural designations will be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the amendments aim to bring specifically into the factors that the Secretary of State has to weigh when considering an application from an authority that an area be designated a rural area the proportion of former local authority and housing association houses which have been bought under the right to buy and then resold and which are let under normal rental arrangements. Such houses are not holiday homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 473 is the most minor amendment and seeks simply to achieve consistency in the style of drafting. Amendment No. 475 seeks to bring section 64 (7) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987, covering designation of areas under the right to buy, in line with our proposals for the Bill. That clarifies the Bill and I hope that the provisions will be welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In explaining the Government amendments in the group at the beginning of the debate, I explained that they were designated to simplify and clarify the exceptions from tenants' choice and to bring the arrangments for the right to buy and for tenants' choice sensibly into line. The honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire rightly and fairly raised this debate because he is particularly interested in the position of rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main purpose of the rural area provisions in the right to buy and tenants' choice legislation is to allow the Secretary of State to intervene if an unreasonable proportion of former public sector housing is being used as holiday homes. This purpose is undiluted by the Government amendments. In rural areas, which the Secretary of State agrees to designate, tenants are able to exercise the right to buy only on condition that, if they wish to resell the house within a period of up to 10 years, first option to purchase must be given to the original local authority or housing association landlord. In line with other instances where the right to buy can only be exercisable with a pre-emption condition, we intend that no tenants' choice transfer will be permitted in areas so designated. I believe that these arrangements are sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the other amendments in this group are to a greater or lesser degree unacceptable. First, they would take the tenants' choice provisions in the Bill very much out of line with those in the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 covering the right to buy. That is the opposite of what we believe we should be seeking to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.00 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider what the effect of amendment No. 480, which was moved by the honourable Member for Berwickshire, would be. The Secretary of State would have a duty, on applications by a local authority, to make an order designating an area as a rural area if more than on third of all the relevant
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0657">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1053</span>
houses had been purchased since the stated dates. The effect of such an order would be to prevent any further tenants exercising tenants' choice, but it would surely be anomalous to prevent, for example, a local authority tenant seeking to transfer to a housing association locally under the provisions of the Bill just because one third of the houses had been sold. All the houses which had been sold could still be owner occupied, or let to tenants, or be available for letting in the normal way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could not recommend that the Committee accept amendment No. 481. In the right to buy legislation and in the Bill, the word "area" is undefined. That allows flexibility. The area might, for example, be the area of the district council as a whole or something smaller. The amendment defineds a rural area as
	<br><blockquote><p>"the area of a district council".</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 481 omits any reference to islands councils, although islands councils are mentioned in clause 51(4)(b). It would also create further anomalies. Some district councils with populations of more than 40,000 have noticeable rural areas—for example, Inverness district council, Gordon district council, Ross & Cromarty district council and Perth and Kinross district council—although I note that all the district councils in the borders would qualify.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That should not preclude giving fresh thought to problems that are brought up by new Bills—by, for example, part III of this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

Such practice leaves an awful lot of room for differences to grow up in different parts of the country. I shall ask the Minister another short question which he may be able to answer quite quickly. Have any rural areas been so designated under the 1980 provisions, or is it too early yet to expect the one third proportion to have been reached in any area? It would be helpful to know, now or later, whether that is the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1054</span>
Although I am happy to withdraw the amendments now that I have my point, I still wish to underline the fact that there are conditions in rural areas that admit of special treatment and do not necessarily readily lend themselves to treatment that may be appropriate for bigger peripheral estates. Although I accept that the amendments are technically defective, the spirit of them should be borne in mind by the Department and it should ensure that any future legislation on housing provision in Scotland is appropriate and properly apposite to the conditions that apply in the landward areas of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the clause that the Government would like to present as the pick of a landlord clause. However, subsection (1) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This Part of this Act has effect for the purpose of conferring on any person who has been approved under section 52 below or Scottish Homes the right to acquire from a public sector landlord any house"—</p></blockquote>
and so on. That creates rights for speculators to seek to acquire people's houses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The honourable Members for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) and for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Lang) should know not to indulge in light conversation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt that the honourable Member for Dumfries is taking part in an important conversation, but he might like to hold it elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause seeks to establish a right for speculators to seek to acquire people's houses. I notice that there was a certain amount of sensitivity on the Government Benches when I described the process as not so much of a pick a landlord system as a trick a tenant system. But that is precisely what the Government hope will take place. Under this mechanism, speculators will be able to use any tactics to entice a tenant to endorse an application to acquire their house from the public sector landlord. When that transaction has been completed, the assured tenancy will replace the secure tenancy and the tenant will find himself with reduced security—and probably a high rent—and be generally worse off. There is a world of difference between that and the tenant's positively choosing to initiate a shift of tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members believe in diversity of housing tenure in Scotland—that is why we want to promote housing associations, housing co-operatives and owner occupation. However, we recognise that for the foreseeable future, the vast majority of people in Scotland who want housing will seek to rent it from a local authority on a secure tenancy at a fair rent. We do not like the devious ploy that the Government are seeking to adopt in order to reduce the public sector and to try to entice tenants into a trap of insecure tenancy and high rents. That would mean a bleaker future for tenants but, of course, an area of great opportunity for profit-making and profiteering for landlords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This prospectus is dishonest—a fact that is exposed and emphasised by the fact that the process is only allowed to go one way. Under the clause, it will be possible for properties to be transferred only from the public sector to the private sector and not the other way round. That shows that the Government are on the defensive. This is a bad clause that will do no good for housing in Scotland and I intend to vote against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The provisions of clause 51 will give choice to public sector tenants who wish to continue renting their homes but would
	<span class='label label-info column'>1056</span>
welcome a change of landlord. The provisions are a valuable addition and will complement the existing provisions enabling tenants in the public sector to purchase their homes. I am unlikely to convince Opposition Members as there is a fundamental difference of views.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should not swallow his own propaganda. He should read the clause rather than the publicity material that he puts out. This clause does not create opportunities for tenants, but opportunities for private landlords to suborn tenants. That is what is wrong and why we intend to vote against the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister attempted to mislead the Committee by saying that the clause extended tenants' choice. If tenants avail themselves of the right to choose a landlord, they will lose a series of rights which they presently enjoy under the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act 1980.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister told us that he once sat up all night on Committee fighting for tenants' rights under that Act. Now he is destroying access to those rights for tenants who avail themselves of the right to choose a private sector landlord. By choosing a private sector landlord and changing to an assured tenancy, they will lose all their rights, such as security of tenure, rights of succession and the right to buy their own house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real motive behind the clause is to attack public sector housing. For years the Minister has starved local authorities of the money that they need to modernise their houses and keep them in a good state of repair. Dundee district council could spend £50 million a year trying to keep its houses in good repair, but the Minister allows it to spend only a fraction of that. Therefore, tenants are left with windows that need to be replaced, dampness, condensation and houses which badly need modernising. The council does not have the money to do it, so when a private sector landlord comes along and offers to put in new windows, tenants will be tricked into surrendering the rights that they now enjoy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All tenants will have the right of veto. Tenants will not have to transfer unless they wish to; it is entirely voluntary. Under clause 2(2)(e), Scottish Homes will have the power to provide and assist in the provision of advisory services for tenants. Obviously, I expect tenants to be fully informed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These amendments deal with the approval of landlords by Scottish Homes as suitable under the tenants' choice provisions in the Bill. The amendments seek to ensure that Scottish Homes must obtain and consider information on a range of matters before they give such approval to landlords. As the Bill stands, there is little in the way of criteria. Under the clause, Scottish Homes must satisfy itself that a landlord has a sound financial footing and is able to provide a high standard of housing management. It must ensure that a monopoly will not be created by specifying the maximum number of houses that any one landlord can take over.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The spirit of the amendment is that such criteria do not go far enough. A new range of criteria is required. Scottish Homes should be required to find out the number, location and nature of the houses owned by each landlord who applies for approval. It is important for Scottish Homes to satisfy itself about the type of landlord with whom it is dealing. It may be someone working on a small scale who may overextend himself and become an unreliable landlord for tenants under his supervision. There is also danger of a landlord who gets too big and has too much influence on the local housing market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish Homes should also look at financial resources, not only how much money a landlord might have in the bank and the assets of his company, but the rental income from the properties that he already owns, what subsidies he receives from the public sector and his expenditure on supervision, management, maintenance and repair of the houses that he owns. It must satisfy itself thoroughly that he is a fit and proper landlord for a local authority tenant who is used to having a good landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish Homes should also satisfy itself about the number and qualifications of the employees of a landlord applying for approval. It is important that he has sufficient quality of staff to provide the supervision, management, maintenance and repair services that tenants have a right to expect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish Homes should also satisfy itself about the policies that the landlord is implementing; for example, his policies on allocation procedures. Does he allocate housing to the person from whom he can get the most money, or does he take into consideration the housing needs of applicants? What does he do about nomination rights for a house? What is his policy on security of tenure, equal opportunities, contract compliance and tenant participation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should have been reasonable and decent and should have met the delegation from Dumbarton district council which came down today, but he refused to see them. They would have pointed
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0660">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1059</span>
out to him that to improve tenant participation it is important for private sector landlords to contribute towards the cost of organising a tenants' association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that Scottish Homes satisfies itself about whether a landlord is a corporate body, where the ownership of his company resides, who the directors are, and which people can be held accountable by the tenant for the landlord's services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under previous clauses and schedules a point was raised about a landlord company being a subsidiary of a bigger company and possibly exploiting that situation to the disadvantage of the tenant. Scottish Homes should oversee to ensure that does not happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that Scottish Homes works closely with local authorities before approving a landlord. Local authorities know the landlords who operate in their areas. Scottish Homes may be a centrally-based organisation and will not have such expertise. It should listen to local authorities and consider the information that they provide. Under the Government's proposals landlords will have a key role, so it is essential that they meet minimum criteria and standards, especially as they will receive huge public subsidies. Scottish Homes, as a public agency, will have to satisfy itself that landlords meet those criteria. Tenants should have the right to know about landlords. One criterion is given in amendment No. 527, which reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2F) Scottish Homes shall enter the information obtained under subsection (2B) above in a register and shall make suitable arrangements for inspection of that register by members of the public, and shall provide facilities for members of the public".</p></blockquote>
Those are facilities to make photocopies of the information and to take it away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tenants' choice should mean real choice and an informed choice. Tenants should have a right to know what type of landlord they are dealing with, the sort of company he operates, his policies, his financial standards and his previous history before they come to decide whether to move from the public sector. If the Minister is serious about extending tenants' choice, he will accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 531 and 532 stand in my name. Amendment No. 531 seeks to add a new subsection (4), which would state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State shall within 14 days of this Part of this Act coming into force prescribe in detail standards to which a person must conform in order to be approved by Scottish Homes under subsection (1) above."</p></blockquote>
I subscribe fully to the spirit of the speech of the honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion). The justification for my proposed subsection (4) is that Scottish Homes will be responsible for approving new landlords before any transfer of property can take place. In the words of the Bill, only a landlord who is an "approved person" from the private or independent sector will be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee should be worried about the lack of detail in the Bill in describing the standards that the Secretary of State will require to make a landlord acceptable to Scottish Homes. Scottish Homes
	<span class='label label-info column'>1060</span>
should state clearly and publicly what those standards are. Landlords should be asked to meet criteria such as credit worthiness and to set out their experience and track record in housing management, their maintenance skills and their legal status. This criteria should be met and the information made public. That is how the Secretary of State should measure the suitability of landlords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before a tenant gives his consent, the new applicant landlord should be made to provide a copy of the draft missive of let. The new subsection (4) proposed in amendment No. 531 seeks to stipulate that the standards set out in the Bill should require landlords to be willing to provide a draft missive of let, which will be useful to tenant and landlord and will allow a reasonable time for legal advice to be sought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 532 also seeks to add a new subsection (4). It states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Scottish Homes shall maintain a register"—</p></blockquote>
the honourable Member for Dundee, East referred to that—
	<br><blockquote><p>"available for inspection by the public of approved persons. The Register shall contain details of the members of the business, size of business, all property owned by the business and such other information as may be prescribed."</p></blockquote>
That, too, is an important point; there is no requirement in the Bill for Scottish Homes to maintain an informative, publicly available register of approved private sector landlords. Tenants have a basic need to obtain information about their new landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recommend that Scottish Homes monitors regularly all such private landlords in consultation with the local authority, which will be best placed to provide local information. It is unacceptable that housing associations should be regularly monitored and expected to adhere to high standards of repair, housing management and financial control, as detailed in housing corporation circulars, while private landlords, under the Bill, need nothing other than the initial approval when applications for transfer are being made. What is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both my amendments deal with small but important points and I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) asked what will happen if a landlord goes broke, and hinted that we should consider the problem. If that happened, Scottish Homes could step in and invite the landlord to consider selling his houses to a housing association, or invite the tenants to form a co-operative, but its action would be enabling rather than policing. If a landlord fails, a liquidator or receiver will be appointed to wind up his affairs, and Scottish Homes will be bound to assist. The landlord division of Scottish Homes could also be involved in offering experience. As a last resort, it could offer to take over the houses. Scottish Homes will be responsible for decisions on approving landlords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments demonstrate that there is considerable common ground in the Committee on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0661">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1061</span>
what needs to be considered in approving a landlord to receive tenants under part III.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two main areas of concern will be the quality of service to be provided because, in the main, that is what will attract tenants to move, and the financial reliability of the new landlord. Amendment No. 527 attempts to set down a more precise description of these qualities but in so doing requires a large and standard set of information to be provided for each and every approval. That is unnecessary and over-specific. There will be cases where the approval is to be given an individual acquisition, in which case the same information would have to be gathered over and over again. There will be cases where small landlords taking on only a few houses are subject to the same force of inquiry as major landlords contemplating substantial transfers. I do not think we need take that path. For the same reasons we do not agree that regulations or standards should be applied by the Secretary of State as suggested by amendments Nos. 548 and 531. We are looking for a flexible approach, although I recognise that as transfers increase in number a standard approach will be developed. The Housing Corporation produces a wide range of publicly available guidance notes to inform housing associations of what the corporation expects and also to assist associations in their work. I am sure a similar system will be operated by Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 527 also suggests that Scottish Homes should consult local authorities in whose area the receiving landlord owns houses. However, tenants will be seeking alternative landlords, presumably because they are less than fully satisfied with their current landlord. In some—indeed most—cases this is likely to be a local authority, so this proposal seems rather unlikely to produce useful results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we are in agreement on the need for Scottish Homes to watch the progress of landlords who have taken on tenants. A monitoring process appropriate to the landlord and all the circumstances of the transfer will be important and a necessary part of the process by which landlords continue to receive tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 7 attempts to apply to tenants' choice landlords' reserve powers available to the Housing Corporation to deal with housing associations that get into serious difficulties. Those powers have only rarely, if at all, been used by the corporation in Scotland and are really pertinent only to associations on the brink of total failure. Many of the landlords which tenants choose will be housing associations, building societies or other major financial institutions, all subject to their own controls. In such circumstances I doubt whether it would be helpful to add another layer of emergency powers. I expect Scottish Homes to be on the scene long before events reach such a stage, as the Housing Corporation is today in relation to housing associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 527 and the similar amendment No. 532 require Scottish Homes to publish all the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1062</span>
information that it obtains to consider a landlord's application. While recognising that Scottish Homes will be open about the landlords whom it approves and that landlords will be keen to attract further tenants, this proposal goes far beyong what is suitable. Amendment No. 527 would, for example, require publication even where the landlord was unsuccessful. It would expose, needlessly, matters of commercial confidence. What is required is for Scottish Homes to make available advice and assistance to tenants seeking a transfer and to landlords wishing to take on tenants. That it will do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Part I of the Bill we were able to show that by keeping the powers of Scottish Homes general, with suitable controls, we should be able to create a body able to act rapidly to deal with housing issues. The same principle must apply to this issue. Tenants' choice must be couched in as few rules as are appropriate to the transfer. This is an important step for a tenant to take and it must be done with professional help and advice. Scottish Homes will take a responsible attitude to its duties and does not need the amendments to ensure that. The amendments add nothing to the safeguards for tenants and would, overall, hinder tenants making tranfers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>The amendment relates to clause 52(2) which deals with the approval of persons who have the right to attempt to trick a tenant, if I may use that phrase. Subsection (2) is drafted too loosely. The restrictions and conditions placed on the approval by Scottish Homes of receiving landlords should be improved. Scottish Homes should have the power to approve landlords subject to certain reasonable conditions. Such conditions are currently available to the Scottish Development Agency. If a landlord knows that he is likely to lose a property or to pay a financial penalty if the approval is revoked, he will perhaps be more wary of adopting improper practices. As the Bill stands, landlords who have the approval of Scottish Homes rescinded pay no penalty and tenants of the rescinded landlord remain his tenants. The amendment is particularly valid for new landlords who have no previous track record. The Government are advising tenants to take a leap in the dark. The tenants are entitled to reasonable safeguards, which are not in the Bill. I commend the amendments to the Committee.</p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) spoke to amendment No. 497. I am prepared to join him in recommending that amendment to the Committee, but the other amendments will not be accepted. Amendment No. 489 seeks to remove the possibility of Scottish Homes giving general approval. In as far as Scottish Homes can give approval for an organisation to be a receiving landlord in particular areas for set periods and thus cover a wide geographical area for a number of years, the amendment would not have much effect. However, a general power of approval is always useful in reducing bureaucracy, so long as there are safeguards. The safeguards will be Scottish Homes' monitoring of landlords' performance. I am sure that Scottish Homes would welcome a general approval power and would not abuse it.

The amendment would ensure that approval of receiving landlords was at least subject to consultation with the local housing authority. Local housing authorities, district councils and Island councils have a reasonable interest in the development of new landlords under the scheme.

only sensible that Scottish Homes should conduct whatever inquiries it considers to be reasonable and necessary to enable it to reach a decision whether to grant approved status. This may well involve an approach to the relevant local authority. Indeed, my right honourable and learned Friend would expect, in guiding Scottish Homes on the exercise of its duties, to encourage the closest possible working links with local authorities. It would, however, be an unreasonable interference to insert into the satute of a requirement that any particular body must be consulted. To do so would fetter unnecessarily Scottish Homes' judgment on such matters and would offer local authorities out of sympathy with the legislation some clear opportunities to delay the transfer process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, in the light of what I have said, honourable Members will accept that Scottish Homes will necessarily consult and will be as free as possible to determine the detail of its procedures for considering applications from prospective landlords. I do not think that it is necessary to write that into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should not judge local authorities in Scotland by his standards. Not everyone is as spiteful as they Tory Administration. It was a quite unnecessary slur on the conudct and integrity of local housing authorities in Scotland. The Minister should accept that a local housing authority knows a great deal about the needs for rented housing in its area. We debated earlier the question of the Shetland islands council. Although that is an extreme example cannot the Minister accept that the Shetland Islands council might be pretty well placed to advise Scottish Homes on whether a new receiving landlord should be approved in the Shetland Islands? Is it good enough simply to rely on the civil servants who man the offices of Scottish Homes in Glasgow or Edinburgh or wherever the headquarters turn out to be?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not make a major debating issue of this as the Committee wants to make headway. The Minister said that it would be normal practice for Scottish Homes to consult local authorities. I think that he is being rather spiteful in not writing that into the Bill, but I am afraid that he seems to have turned that way recently. In the light of the limited assurance that he gave us, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is purely a probing amendment. Subsection (3) provides than an approval under the clause may be revoked by Scottish Homes without prejudice to any transaction previously completed. The point has been made that the subsection makes no mention of transactions where missives have been concluded at the time of withdrawal of approval. I hope that my honourable Friend can clarify the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 333 may be a probing amendment, but the other amendments grouped with it are considerably more substantive. If the approval of a landlord is revoked, the decision would presumably be taken because of some misconduct or failure on the part of that landlord. Under those circumstances, the tenants of that landlord are entitled to a degree of protection. We take the view that housing stock of a landlord who falls foul of the system in that way should revert to the original public sector landlord in the interests of all concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak to amendments Nos. 512, 549, 513 and 547. This takes us back to our debate on the registration of landlords. There is considerable concern among Opposition Members that the Government are opposed to the idea of a continuing approval of landlords. Reference has been made to the meeting, at which all the members of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1066</span>
Committee were invited, with tenants and people from Dumbarton district council. However, only Labour Members showed up. That fact should be recorded. The tenants—who represented a local tenants' association—SSHA tenants and district council tenants expressed strongly their fears about the consequences of landlords going bankrupt. The Bill does not cover that eventuality. The tenants are worried that they would have no rights at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a variety of consequences of a bankruptcy. Presumably, the property would simply transfer to the judicial factor or to the trustee in the bankruptcy or to the receiver, depending on the particular circumstances of the landlord. The tenants' rights would be protected in those circumstances. However, new tenants may not be protected if standard security has been created over the property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those real fears were expressed to those members of the Committee who took the trouble to turn up to hear what the tenants had to say. I would like the Minister to tell us how we can allay those fears, given the Bill as it stands. One way would be to accept the amendments which cover that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak briefly to amendments Nos. 499, 500 and 501. There is some anxiety about what happens when an approved landlord is revoked. The amendments seek to ensure that the tenants will have the choice of either selecting another private landlord or reverting to their original landlord. They then suggest options in which the tenants have some right of appeal if they are unhappy with their new landlord's standard of service. It would be left to Scottish Homes to decide whether the tenant's appeal was justified and to take any action. These are important points because it is a difficult situation. The Bill is vague about what obtains when an approved landlord is revoked. The Minister should seek to allay some of the fears that have been expressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to supplement the point of my honourable Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) about our important discussions today with the tenants' representatives from Dumbarton. They are concerned about the powers that the Secretary of State has been given under the Bill, and fear that the Secretary of State is emerging as all-powerful. They think it strange that he does not have the power to revoke the entitlement of a landlord to operate once it has been granted. They say that he is taking unto himself quite considerable powers in the main provisions of the Bill, but that when it comes to this important element he is not prepared to do so. They said that the Secretary of State should be given the power to suspend or revoke a landlord's registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition's amendments set out clearly how that could be achieved. Local authorities should be given the power to recommend suspension or withdrawal of a landlord's registration. That seems an eminently sensible provision. Under the proposals for new landlords, tenants will have no right of appeal
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0664">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1067</span>
to their local government ombudsman and the power of local councillors to intervene will be extremely limited. The views that were expressed today came from tenants themselves, not simply from Labour politicians. Those who will be directly affected by the legislation said that tenants should be given the right of appeal to an independent agency established specifically for that purpose. These are reasonable propositions in relation to the other powers that the Secretary of State is taking upon himself in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should first answer my honourable Friend the Member for Eastwood on his question about missives. The Law Society of Scotland has also raised that point. The transaction is completed when missives have been concluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) raised an important matter, which I answered when I replied to the last group of amendments. The honourable Gentleman may not have been in the Room at that time. Scottish Homes would have the responsibility to step in and sort out the problem and, as a last resort, the landlord would play a key role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Each of the amendments is related to the exercise by Scottish Homes of its powers to revoke, in certain circumstances, the approval it conferred on a landlord. The wording in lines 17 and 18 is helpful because it clarifies that, given that the transfers under the provisions will be legal transfers of ownership, they cannot be overridden by any decision of Scottish Homes after the ownership has formally passed to another person. The wording also means that a transaction in progress but not finalised must be aborted if approval is withdrawn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish Homes must monitor approved landlords' performance. The Housing Corporation in Scotland already does that in its role as registrar for housing associations. Many of the receiving landlords under tenants' choice will be registered housing associations, so monitoring in cases where those associations take on more tenants will impose no additional duty on Scottish Homes. It will be expected to maintain appropriate oversight of other approved landlords' performance. Such oversight will be of a different nature from the close monitoring of housing associations, as it serves a much narrower purpose. Nevertheless, it will be sufficient to ensure that Scottish Homes is aware of the position. If any of the landlords was seen to be failing to provide a good service, it would be quite unreasonable to expect Scottish Homes to be prepared to allow other tenants to transfer to that landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, amendment No. 277 is wholly unacceptable. If Scottish Homes revokes its approval of the landlord, the amendment could be interpreted as requiring the landlord to give up all his property, whether acquired under the Bill or otherwise, to the previous owner. Drafting details apart, there are several good reasons why a return to the original landlord is undesirable. First, the previous landlord—say a local authority—might not wish to take on the property again. Secondly, Scottish Homes may withdraw approval of a landlord as a receiving
	<span class='label label-info column'>1068</span>
landlord for several reasons. The size of the landlord's stock may have grown to an extent that its existing management team is unable to cope properly. In such cases, approval as a receiving landlord could be withdrawn until the management team was strengthened. It would seem wholly unreasonable that compulsory repurchase should take place just because any receiving landlord found himself a little over-stretched, perhaps temporarily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the position of the tenant. In exercising tenants' choice in the first palce, the tenant chose to move away from his public sector landlord for whatever reason. Why should the tenant be saddled with an immediate return to the local authority?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 499 does not seek to go as far as amendment No. 277, but it would leave unclear the position of tenants of a landlord whose approval has been revoked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 500 would restrict Scottish Homes to action that might not be suitable or appropriate in every case where representations were received. It would be wrong to include so precise a direction in the Bill, and equally unacceptable to put in statute the requirement suggested by amendment No. 513. However, in guiding Scottish Homes on the exercise of its duties, my right honourable and learned Friend will encourage close monitoring of landlords' performances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 501 is based on the premise that revocation of approval would disturb the tenancy agreements in existence. As I have explained, the provisions of clause 52(3) have been designed to emphasise that, while approved status can be withdrawn, that action does not undo any transaction legally completed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 512, although complex, seeks in essence to turn the clock back in cases where Scottish Homes' approval has been revoked, or where the approved landlord has been declared bankrupt or has gone into liquidation. I have already explained that, in the context of revocation, existing legally completed, transfers of property should not be set aside. The thrust of amendment No. 512, as regards the situation of landlords no longer financially secure, would be to allow their tenants to exercise tenants' choice again. That could prevent the effective winding up of the lanlord's holdings. It would not be right to set aside the normal procedures in those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nor can I accept amendment No. 549, Tenants' choice is not about transfers between private sector landlords. The right in the Bill will be for approved landlords, and Scottish Homes, to acquire from public sector landlords property in which public funds have been invested. The acquisition of private sector property is a different matter. Moreover, I cannot accept arrangements where legally completed disposals of property can be revoked retrospectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 547 is similarly unacceptable. Questions as to the valuation of property in the circumstances outlined will be for seller and the buyer to determine, although Scottish Homes will be exepcted to satisfy itself as to the bona fides of any transaction before giving approval.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0665">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1069</span>
For all those reasons, I believe that subsection (3) should remain as drafted. It offers useful clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for East Kilbridge (Mr. Ingram), asked why my right honourable and learned Friend the Secretary of State did not have the power to withdraw approval of landlords. We have delegated those powers to Scottish Homes, but my right honourable and learned Friend can direct Scottish Homes on all its junctions. Therefore, my right honourable and learned Friend has a residual power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my honourable Friend for clarifying the point that the Law Society raised. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that clause 52, as amended, should not stand part of the Bill. It establishes which landlords should be eligible to make overtures to tenants under this trick-a-tenant provision, in the hope of enticing them out of secure, regulated public sector tenancies into insecure, private sector tenancies with higher rents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The exercise on which the Government are embarking is fairly pointless. The Government see it as a device for reducing the public sector for purely doctrinaire reasons. We have come to expect that from them. The fatal flaw in the clause is the second half of subsection (1), which excludes only district councils from the right to acquire public sector houses and houses belonging to other landlords. If the Government seriously believed in tenants' choice, they should give all tenants a choice, regardless of which sector they happen to be in. If the Government were really interested in extending choice and in diversifying tenure, they should open up the scheme to private sector tenants. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>1070</span>
provision is lopsided, unfair and flawed, and I urge my honourable Friend to vote against the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make two brief points. As we have discussed, clause 52 provides that the right to acquire public sector houses shall be exercisabled only by Scottish Homes or by landlords approved by Scottish Homes, and public sector landlords are specifically excluded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We discussed that fully in the context of an earlier group of amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause also inclues powers for Scottish Homes to revoke approvals give, although such revocations will not disturb any transaction previously completed. Those powers are an essential part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
