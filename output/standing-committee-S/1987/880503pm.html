	<br><q><p>"(c) Any functions delegated to them by the Secretary of State in exercising his powers under sections 73 to 75 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 and under this Act.".—[	<i>Mr. Allan Stewart.</i>]</p></q></p>

	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this it will be convenient to take new clause 1—	<i>Grant maintained schools</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>"(1)The Secretary of State may provide for the establishment of grant-maintained schools, subject to the provisions of this section, and financed under section 73 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980.</p>
	<p>(2) The Secretary of State shall arrange for a secret postal ballot to be held on the question of whether grant-maintained status should be sought where he receives a written request for such a ballot from a number of parents of registered pupils at the school equal to at least 20 per cent. of the number of registered pupils at the school on the date on which the request is received.</p>
	<p>(3) The Secretary of State may ask the School Board to conduct the ballot, or make such other arrangements as he considers appropriate.</p>
	<p>(4) Where the result of a ballot held in accordance with subsection (2) above shows a simple majority in favour of seeking grant-maintained status for the school, the Secretary of State shall publish a draft instrument in accordance with which the school is to be governed (to be known as the articles of government).</p>
	<p>(5) After consultation with the education authority, the articles of government of the school shall be made by order of the Secretary of State. The articles will provide for the constitution of a board of management for the grant-maintained school.</p>
	<p>(6) On an incorporation date determined by the Secretary of State in relation to a grant-maintained school, the property rights and liabilities of the education authority formerly responsible for the school shall be transferred to, and by virtue of this Act rest in, the board of management of the grant-maintained school.".</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Lewis Moonie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kirkcaldy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have waited a long time for this opportunity to participate in the debate, and I hope that everyone will agree when I sit down that my contribution was worth waiting for, although I would not put any bets on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly the Minister has been under a slight misapprehension—he keeps mistaking me for my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish). That is an unlikely mistake for anyone who does not appear to have difficulties with his sight. I can assume only that he read one of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>196</span>
Sunday newspapers which described me as being over 12 stone in weight. Altough technically correct, that description is rather woolly and imprecise. The Minister's mistake is understandable if he has been reading the wrong newspapers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with great interest to the debate: some hon. Members have made better points than others, but most of the good points have come from Opposition Members, with two noble exceptions from Conservative Members, neither of whom are present now. The speech of the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) reminded me of a good friend who was my best man. As a party piece he used to recite Tarn O'Shanter. If he was interrupted, he always went back to the beginning. I am sure that the hon. Member for Tayside, North will not object to that mild insult at his expense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason I did so was that it was obvious that Opposition Members had not been listening. Sadly, as with children, one goes over it again to ensure that the point has been understood.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the sad features of debate is that it is not always possible to convince the other side by the power of one's rhetoric and the force and content of the argument. Clearly that is what has happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In passing, I add that had the present comprehensive system been in force when the hon. Member for Tayside, North was a lad—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) are under a complete misapprehension if they do not know that there was comprehensive education when I was at school. Youngsters could go to secondary schools, and when they reached the age of 15 years they could transfer to what were then the academies. That system of comprehensive education existed. I understand that you went through a similar system, Mr. Knox.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There were schools that took in all pupils from the neighbourhood when there was no junior secondary school in the area to which transfers could be made. But comprehensive education implies that pupils are all taken into the same school and are all taught in the same groups. By so doing those who are less fortunate academically are encouraged to realise their best potential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I genuinely believe that the comprehensive system has illustrated that over the past few years and at last is getting results that were not expected, especially in O-grade passes, which now go to children for whom they never originally intended. That is because of the general quality of the system provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with interest to the Minister's long contribution to the debate. It was certainly long on ideology and perhaps a little short on the practical experience of the Scottish education system, other than his fortunate time at school and university. I have rather more exposure to the system than that, having served on an education committee and having
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0862">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>197</span>
been deeply involved with teaching children with special needs through my work with people with mental handicap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to concentrate on an area that has not been covered in detail. The amendment is fundamentally wrong in principle. I have several objections to it and were it passed into law it would be unworkable in practice. A school exists to service the education needs of all the community and not only the children who happen to attend it between the hours of 9 and 4. It serves the needs of adults, ordinary pupils and those with special needs. Special education needs cover physical and mental handicap and children with behavioural problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would the education requirements—formal, informal or special needs—and the recreation needs of a community, which are closely bound up with the overall health of that community, still be satisfied were a school allowed to opt out? It is unlikely that any schools in my area would opt out. However, Balwearie high school in Kirkcaldy has vast recreation facilities and runs a large-scale informal further education programme. If the needs of the community were subordinated to the desire of the schoo' to opt out there would be a considerable loss to the community. The capital investment which the local authority has put into that school and into Kirkcaldy high school through the construction of a new games hall and junior building has to be paid for. The investment made by the community through taxes and rates is for the children now at the schools and the community for a long time to come. A school may have a lifespan of 100 years. It would not be good if people were able to decide at one stage in that lifespan that it was in their interest for a school to opt out of the state system and be put under their control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the amendment has not been comprehensively drafted, and certain points might be covered in future. But it requires a simple majority of parents voting and takes no account of those who, for various reasons might fail to cast a vote. That is bad. The hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) should consider whether an overall majority of the total number of parents should take such a serious step rather than a majority of perhaps only 25 per cent. voting because of a lack of interest. People do not appreciate the problems that arise and may not vote in the first instance, only to realise afterwards that they made a mistake. They would then have no option. So, the problem of voting should be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What provision would be made for repayment of this asset to the local authorities, bearing in mind that they would show a loss? How would that be covered through payment by the Government, especially if further provision were needed to compensate for the loss to the system? Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have made the point that schools should be considered as part of a whole. Opting out would be a loss to the whole community and any decision should not be in the interests of only those whose children attend the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>198</span>
There are shortcomings in the system. I am worried that a popular school—a magnet school—opting out would end up perforce operating a selection policy. We have to assume that applications for places would be more than 100 per cent. The buildings are finite and authority would not always be given for capital spending. It might take several years to ensure additional provision. Were that provision not forthcoming, how would those running the school decide who should be admitted if the number of applications exceeded the number of places available? I think, that there are only two ways in which restrictions could be placed on admission, one of them being some form of artificial selection and the other by charging fees. I am saying not that that is the Government's intention but that one or other of those outcomes is inevitable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it would be helpful to members of the Committee who do not agree with the hon. Gentleman's analysis if he could explain why that does not happen at present with magnet schools to which parents choose to send their children under the parents' charter? There are a number of such schools, some of which my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) has mentioned. Paisley grammar is one of them, and according to Strathclyde regional council it is more than 100 per cent. full. It is able to deal with the capacity problem without embarking on either of the courses that the hon. Gentleman suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is that Strathclyde has not until now operated a selection policy. Nor should I expect it to do so. That would not necessarily be the case if the school were controlled by an elected school board under the Secretary of State. Strathclyde regional council does not operate a selection policy because it does not believe in it. It is as simple as that. We are talking about two completely different things.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Another point is whether a school can operate at overcapacity. In the crucial years of S3 and S4 pupils, have to make curriculum choices. For a particular subject—for example a practical subject such as chemistry—there may be a maximum number of pupils in the class. The curriculum can become distorted by overcapacity. Even in a school with a roll of 1,500, to have one or two pupils extra could have a deleterious effect on education provision in the school. That backs up what you are saying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not recall having said anything.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The magical word "you" has been used again, Mr. Knox. I shall endeavour to avoid using it myself because I do not wish to incur your wrath.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is merely that an opinion would appear to have been attributed to me which I do not hold.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0863">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>199</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that it is inevitable that some form of selection would be operated by popular schools in an area where other schools were perhaps suffering difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not agree with opting out. There is something fundamentally wrong with the principle of it. I believe that it will damage the local community. The wider community could also be damaged if pupils are attracted away from their areas by a magnet school. If pupils of greater ability are attracted away, the academic standards of the local schools will be diluted. Under the infantile system of statistics used in this country, the comparisons would be even more odious than at present. We do not standardise the data used in comparing schools. That is one of the main reasons why in future legislation we shall oppose the publication of tables of assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another problem—I take a school in my own area, Balwearie high school, as an example—is that special provisions will be lost because they are expensive. For example, a learning support service has been developed in Fife to an extent that is rare in other regions. The region has largish learning support departments, which employ teachers who are trained on the diploma course in Edinburgh. The department organises team teaching in a classroom and help for the many children in the comprehensive system who need help to keep up with their class mates and with the rate of work demanded of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fife provides also for special needs, both physical and mental. Fife has a policy that children with mental or physical handicaps should be educated as far as possible in the mainstream. That places an enormous burden on the system. Some physically handicapped children may need one care assistant between one or two of them to enable them to function in mainstream education. Obviously, the cost per handicapped child is much higher than that per able-bodied child. Would that be properly taken into account if we had a system of opting out?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also difficulties with unruly pupils with behaviour problems. I suspect that a school that had opted out would also tend to opt out of those problems and attempt to pass such pupils off to less fortunate schools elsewhere in the locality rather than take responsibility for its full catchment area. On those grounds, I have grave reservations about the value of the proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider the problem of the method of payment of a school that has opted out. Presumably, payment would be by direct grant from the Secretary of State, but a direct grant from what? Presumably, it would be top sliced from the general education budget or from that proportion of it that can be attributed to education when the needs and resources elements of the grant are set. The unsophisticated financial management system operated by the Scottish Office if not—thanks to computerisation—by local authorities, makes it difficult to break down such figures within present programmes. Presumably, top-sliced funding would be based on the average cost per pupil, but which average cost? Would it be the average cost in the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>200</span>
region or in Scotland as a whole? Will the money be taken from the top of the pool, thus penalising all regional authorities for the opted-out school, or will the money be taken purely from the region from which the school has opted out? If the latter, should the average or marginal cost of pupils be lost to the regional budget?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister would like to answer, hypothetically, one or two of those questions. Clearly, he will be responsible for working out how to pay for the system if it is ever introduced. An average sum for opted-out schools in each region would be fraught with difficulties for the Minister. He could scarcely deduct from Lothian region's budget the average cost of pupils educated within the region in order to fund an opted-out school. Would not that tacitly accept that that was the level of expenditure that the regional council was supposed to put into education?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman tempts me into the debate. Many of the schools referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) have costs per pupil considerably below the average for Strathclyde because they are popular schools which are full. They are the cheapest schools in Strathclyde. My hon. Friend pointed out that irony in speaking to the new clause. In seeking to make economies, Strathclyde has targeted some schools that are cost effective and popular. Giving opted-out schools the average cost would leave those schools substantially in pocket. We should have to consider that carefully, but for the opposite reasons from those implied by the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not implying any qualitative assessment. I am implying that the Minister would have difficulty accepting that the average cost per pupil in an area such as Lothian was a reasonable sum to devote to an opted-out school. The Secretary of State is about to deduct grant from Lothian because of its overspending. As education accounts for two-thirds of Lothian's budget, presumably in the Government's view it is overspending on education. Inconsistencies could develop in such an approach to the funding of opted-out schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have mentioned the ballot provision in passing, but I wish to stress again that the provision for a simple majority of those voting is inadequate. If the hon. Member for Eastwood ever brings the proposal back to Committee, I hope that will make the change that I suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point about the nature of majority that would be reasonable in the Scottish context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures in new clause 1 are not tablets of stone. If there was an agreement in principle, there could be considerable argument about the relevant figures, for both the trigger and the majority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suppose that, in all fairness, I have to say that even if the hon. Member for Eastwood were to bring in such a provision, while it might be fairer I still would not agree with it for the other reasons that I gave earlier in my short contribution to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0864">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>201</span>
In summary, I believe that the proposal is seriously flawed. I disagree with it in principle because of the damage that it would do to education both within the narrow community that the school represents and in the wider community of which it is part. I sincerely hope that such a selfish and inconsiderate proposal would never find support in the House of Commons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gordon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have the opportunity to comment on the amendment and the new clause. I apologise to the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) for not being present when he moved the amendment, although I have read the 	<i>Official Report</i> of the proceedings. We had good new in my area of a new oil field being brought on stream and it was inaugurated by the Prince of Wales. I hope that members of the committee understand why I wished to be there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened to the debate and read the report with interest, but I am slightly disappointed that the hon. Member for Eastwood has put forward a proposal that seems to me to be triggered more by his constituency experience than by any wider philosophy, although I believe that others in his party have a wider philosophy. I do not quarrel with the hon. Gentleman for that, but we have not had a fulsome explanation of the merits of his proposal. I certainly have not been convinced, and neither have two of his colleagues. The hon. Member for Dumfried (Sir H. Monro) was rightly described this morning as an old school Conservative—a genuine Conservative who believes that his job is to try to conserve things, to qualify and question change and ensure that it does not take place in too radical a manner or too quickly. The Minister may find that irritating and he must feel rather impatient, but it is a fairly traditional strand which is established in the Conservative party and which he would, perhaps, do well to respect. My immediate neighbour in constituency terms, the right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith), has explained forcefully that in our respective areas there is no evidence of a demand for the measure. Indeed, there is some anxiety about its implications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We may move from this to a new piece of legislation, but if the issue is to be debated seriously it must take account of a cross-section of views and opinions and must not be forced through as some kind of doctrinaire steamroller by a political section with an ulterior motive. Several times, the Minister has rebuffed suggestions that opting out could lead to the introduction of selection, let alone fee-paying. He cited the English Bill as though it were his source material. I have two comments to make about that. First, the Scottish education system is different from the English system. Many of us feel that it is well established and is in some ways superior to the English system and we do not want it simply to be equated with what is happening in England if that is to be taken as a precedent. Secondly, I understand that if a school in England opts out, although it will not be allowed immediately to change its character, after due period it will be allowed to do so. Those of us who fear that the purpose behind this measure is to establish a new generation of selective schooling
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>202</span>
on the grammar school model have every reason to believe that that is part of the thrust. The Prime Minister is well known for her view that the grammar school system is a good one and one that she would like to see introduced, or re-introduced where it has been swept away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not wish to mislead the hon. Gentleman in any way. When I mentioned the English legislation I was merely pointing to what had happened in England. I would not for one moment want the hon. Gentleman to take it that any of the provisions in the English Bill need necessarily be included in any future Scottish legislation, should we be minded to accept the advice of my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart). I was merely trying to help those members of the Committee who did not seem to appreciate that it would be possible to follow his prescriptions and to have schools in the state sector funded by the Scottish Office without any of the other traits which they argued would be undesirable in the context of the Scottish education system. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman can make any points on either side of the argument there. I was merely trying to be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the Minister's intervention. In a sense, honours are even. The Minister states his view and I state mine. I think that opting out is likely to lead to selection. Those of us who fear that are entitled to argue that case. I notice that in accordance with recent changes of evangelical policy within the Conservative party the Prime Minister has appointed herself as a missionary to Scotland. She believes that it is her duty to make regular forays to educate us in the wisdom of her approach. I am not sure whether that is a compliment or a criticism of the Minister who probably thought that he was doing quite well on his own.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cumbernauld and Kilsyth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman anticipates me. I was referring to my neighbour, the right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside who, broadly speaking, shares my view on this issue. I would be more than happy to see the Prime Minister regularly visiting his constituency to argue that he is wrong and she is right. I am quite sure what the outcome would be there at the general election, although I have not the slightest doubt that the right honourable Gentleman would robustly defend his own views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Behind all this there is an important and serious point. We may be in danger of once again turning education into a political football. It is right for the Opposition to probe and it is right for the issues to be explored in some detail. It really is a little ironic that the Government, having backed off on ceiling powers which were going to allow school boards substantial executive powers over the running of their schools, now propose to consider—if not in this Bill, in the next one—an opting-out proposal far deeper and more wide ranging in its implications than
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0865">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>203</span>
the ceiling proposals which were comprehensively rejected by the consultation process. The Minister, making a virtue of necessity, has claimed that the consultation process over the proposals for the Bill has been genuine and successful and that a great many of the representations that have been made have led to a modification of the Government's original proposals. I hope that when the Minister replies to the debate he will give an assurance that the same consultation process would take place in advance of any proposals for opting out and that the same weight would be given to any representations that had been received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I have not quite finished my remarks, I hope that the Minister will take on board that I regard a clear answer on that point as the most useful definitive statement he could make in his final comments on the new clause. Can he assure us that this debate in this Committee will not be used as the basis of the airing of the views and that the much wider consultation process with parents and teachers throughout Scotland will not in some way be bypassed? The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) referred to the poll in 	<i>The Scotsman.</i> The hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) took issue with the wording of the question. As the hon. Member for Tayside, North acknowledged, all one can say is that one question in one poll does not confirm an argument one way or the other, so it would be foolish if that poll carried a great deal of weight. If a majority of people choose to follow a course of action, as natural democrats Scots are unlikely to say that they should not be allowed to do it. The Conservative party is fully capable of doing that. Most of the rest of Scotland, being democratic, is not. That is one reason why the question was asked in a way that was likely to produce a higher result than would be the case in reality, in terms of the parents' own expressions of what they would wish for their children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that 20 per cent. of parents would be enough to force a vote on whether a school could opt out. I do not wish to go into an argument about what the right figure would be, and anyway I agree with the hon. Member for Kircaldy (Dr. Moonie) that I would not be persuaded on the basis of the figure. However, it is a recipe for potential divisiveness in a school. If a group of parents who represent one-fifth of the children in a school have a determined idea that they want their school to opt out, they can continually agitate to try to ensure that they get a poll. Many people will feel threatened, and it will divert attention from the mainstream objective of getting on with the business of ensuring that the school is run to the best of everyone's ability. The figure would certainly need to be higher if the proposals ever became law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another issue of concern is what the consequences of opting-out will be for the allocation of both capital and revenue within education. When a school opts out, it does not just take its own teachers, pupils and parents, but its own resources. There is legitimate concern that if a significant number of schools opt out in a given area, the schools that remain will be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>204</span>
underfunded and starved of resources. A divergence will open up within the community, which will be socially and educationally divisive and not in the best interests of the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is intriguing and disturbing that the Minister and the hon. Member for Eastwood are putting forward these proposals on the basis of parental choice. Who will speak up for the child whose parent does not choose on his or her behalf? That is a real problem in the education system. The hon. Member for Tayside, North regaled us with the merits of the junior and secondary school system that used to apply. Having been involved in that debate, I should say that a genuine conflict arose between the education interests and the parent and community interests. Many parents said, "Our son will only be a farm boy, so he will not need a major education and we are happy for him to go to the local school, leave as soon as possible and come home and work." Yet many teachers and members of the education authority said that some of those lads were bright and able and should be given an opportunity for more education. I do not know how to resolve this problem, but it is a genuine dilemma. Higher up the education system, we have seen some improvement in social mix at the O grade level, but with highers, college and university entrance the social mix of pupils going through the system to that level has not fundamentally changed in 40 years. It is not true that academic ability and ability to progress in education is directly related to the motivation, income or social status of parents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman accept that if the parents are determined that their child will not continue at school, the chances of his doing so must be remote, regardless of his talent and ability? It is important to recognise that it is the parental decision that matters, which is why parents should be much more involved in schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not dispute that the hon. Gentleman has hit on the nub of the problem, but we should not stop there. We should find ways of ensuring that parents are encouraged to have higher aspirations for their children, and that the children themselves are given the oppportunity if not at that level, then later on—to take second chances. That is the importance of second-chance education. One of the great successes of the Open university is that it has been able to provide an opportunity for many youngsters and mature people who missed out as youngsters. That problem in the education system suggests that parents are not always right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The suggestion has been made that opting out will provide greater choice and we have heard about the virtues of offering individual subject choice. It has been accepted that outside the core curriculum, even within the existing local authority system, some schools offer different subjects from other schools. Trying to ensure greater flexibility within the existing parents' charter would extend that choice. That would give options in an urgan area for certain subjects to be pursued across school boundaries and in rural areas parents would have a genuine choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0866">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>205</span>
In my constituency many parents would like to opt for another school, not because they are dissatisfied with their neighbourhood school but because they feel that the range of options would be more suited to their child. But the difficulties and costs of transport preclude those parents from exercising that choice. The Government make great play of the parents' charter and I am surprised that they have not acted on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subject of music varies from school to school in my area. I regard music as more fundamental to the curriculum than do most education authorities. What is available is variable. One of the largest schools in my constituency, in Ellon, has one of the best academic records—which shows that size is not a factor—and has a particularly good music department. I use that department regularly as I hold my constituency surgeries there when I am in that town. From that system we have produced many distinguished pupils. One of them, Evelyn Glennie, has gained national fame. She went deaf at the age of 12, but was able to pursue her career in music at Ellon Academy. She later went to the Royal Academy and is now a professional musician, specialising in percussion. She is an extremely talented young woman who benefited from that system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why not allow choice in the local authority system, rather than trying to foment a completely new tier where barriers will be erected that will prohibit easy movement in and out? Perhaps the hon. Member for Eastwood will take up that point in his reply. If it is possible to opt out, why should it not be possible to opt back in? It should not be a one-way street.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand why the hon. Gentleman was not here last Thursday, but is he able to say anything about the issue of Notre Dame, and Our Lady and St. Francis, because that was the central case study in my argument for opting out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not feel able to comment because I do not have a direct, personal knowledge of that. I prefer to speak on those areas about which I know most. The earlier reference to Jordanhill in this context is not a relevant example. It is a unique school, attached to a teacher training college. Leaving aside the argument about where it wished to go and where it finished up, it is not a mainstream school. It is a successful and good school, but was established in special circumstances for particular reasons, which subsequently changed. I am less than convinced that the examples put forward are anything other than special cases. They do not seem to support the general contention that the provision to allow schools to opt out should be enshrined in law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be happy to debate constructively the possibility of the Secretary of State, in exceptional circumstances, having powers to consider allowing a school to be set up on a particular basis. I do not object to the idea that such exceptional circumstances exist. However, I do not accept the argument that we should have blanket legislation to allow any school, under its own determination, to opt out. Opting out is not merely a matter of the parents of a school
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>206</span>
saying that they want to go in a particular direction, and there is limited evidence to suggest that they would want to do so. If they make that choice, they accept no reponsibility for the schools and the local authority that they leave behind. We have a responsibility to take the overall position into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) argued fairly well that, over the past 20 to 25 years, we have established a general comprehensive system throughout Scotland. Leaving aside some people's arguments that they wished that it had been done differently or did not agree with it, it would be extremely unfortunate to go through a reverse upheaval for the next 25 years, just when the system has a chance to settle down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency, where only a tiny proportion of parents opt out, an overwhelming proportion of people say to me, "The education system that we have here in Grampian is first class". Many people who have moved into the area from England say that it is superior to the English system. It provides a greater breadth of choice and a better social mix, which works well. Why should they be faced with ideological reasons for disrupting that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept the argument that no one is forced to opt out. In reality, once the Bill is enacted the pressures and political agitation will start to grow. Even if a group of parents fail to persuade the majority in their area to opt out, their agitating for it would not create a unifying force within a school. Therefore, to suggest that the proposals are merely a matter of choice, and to ignore the divisiveness that could develop within the system, is narrow and potentially rather ideological.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the Minister said from the outset that he does not wish to accept the motion and that the hon. Member for Eastwood who moved it has said that he will not press it. I repeat my earlier statement that I hope before the debate is closed, the Minister will provide a categorical assurance that there will be no legislation to introduce optng out to Scottish schools without full, extended consultation with parents and teachers throughout Scotland on the same scale as we have witnessed for the Schools Board (Scotland) Bill. Although I remain critical of many aspects of this Bill, it is a considerable improvement on the original proposals and is much closer to the idea of strengthening school councils than the ceiling powers that were envisged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having gone through the exercise on this Bill, it would be dishonest of the Government if they then introduced an even more radical measure—namely opting out—without going to the same lengths of consultation. If the Minister really believes that consultation is a good thing, as the right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside continually maintains, will he assure us that he will not introduce a Bill in the next Session containing refinements of opting-out proposals with going through such a process of consultation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a long debate on the opting-out motion tabled by the hon. Member for Eastwood. It was right that we should do that,

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>207</span>
although he started by saying that he would seek leave of the Committee to withdraw the motion at an appropriate time. I see that he did not go to Strasbourg as he promised and is here in person to withdraw it later today. However, it is only fair to say that having listened so carefully to and participated at such length in the question of opting out, we hope that the Committee will make up its mind. He will no doubt accept that that is appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We got off to an extraordinary start when the hon. Member for Eastwood denied that he was part of a conspiracy involving the Prime Minister. I shall not reiteriate the points that were made, but it is clear that the Prime Minister's office, either through the agency of the hon. Gentleman or of senior civil servants, has become involved in opting out. Indeed, the hon. Gentleman has the notoriety of being mentioned in the letters exchanged between Downing street and the Scottish Office. One letter stated:
	<br><q><p>"The Prime Minister agrees too that the Government's future policy should be spelled out in a response to the amendment which Allan Stewart"—</p></q>
the hon. Member for Eastwood—
	<br><q><p>"is expected to put down to this Session's School Boards (Scotland) Bill. Your Secretary of State will no doubt wish to ensure that Mr. Stewart does indeed table a suitable amendment which could prompt the Secretary of State's statement about future policy."</p></q>
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already heard the Minister respond to the hon. Member for Eastwood. The hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) could not be here to hear him, but he made a specific point about consultation, which is worthy of just a little of the Minister's time, should he be so ill-advised as to pursue the issue of opting out in a Bill to come before Parliament during the next Session. Senior civil servants know that there will be an education Bill next Session, although the Queen has not yet been told. The letter mentions a scheme that will be developed
	<br><q><p>"for inclusion in next Session's Scottish Education Bill",</p></q>
so we know that there will be a Scottish education Bill in this year's Queen's Speech and that we shall devote time to it after November.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a short but effective consultation period following the publication of the Government's proposals for school boards. The hon. Member for Gordon made a strong case for similar arrangements to be introduced before opting-out legislation is even considered. There is no widespread consent to the proposal in Scotland. Consent is confined to schools that have a grievance against or a difference of opinion with the education authority at a given time. Parents would be ill-advised to choose a temporary argument with the education authority as a ground for opting out of their school in perpetuity. Those who are tempted to believe that opting out has some merit in the context of the current controversy surrounding school closures in the Strathclyde region would be ill-advised to regard that as good grounds for opting out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State—and to a lesser extent the Minister—took the view that there was not a consensus in favour of opting out in Scotland, hence the repeated assurances that the introduction of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>208</span>
school boards is not intended to pave the way for opting out and that there are no plans for opting out. That view changed when the Minister referred to real and substantial demands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman examines the record he will find that my right honourable Friend the Prime Minister, my right honourable and learned Friend the Secretary of State and I have all said consistently from the early part of the summer that we would not rule out the possibility or stand in the way of opting out if demand was evident. There is no question of any change of position or difference of line. Our position is established and is on the record. Numerous people have sought to find differences of view but so far they have not succeeded in doing so, other than by making assertions such as the one just made by the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister says, we can all examine the record.

However, we shall debate opting out again at length, and I am certain that we shall have every opportunity this summer to discuss the Government's view, particularly if the Minister introduces proposals and certainly if there is a consultation period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon Friend recall that on Second Reading the Secretary of State for Scotland made the Government's view clear?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I well recall that point, and I well recall that Mr. James Scott, erstwhile Secretary to the Scottish Education Department said that opting out
	<br><q><p>"could not realistically appear in the Scottish agenda before another election."</p></q>
There is an optimist! I can understand why he is doing something else now. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] It would be better for the Government to adopt that position when one considers what they fought the election on. No mandate was given to the Government on a United Kingdom basis to introduce opting out in Scotland. I refer to the outcome of the election in Scotland and to what the Government said that they would do with education in Scotland. Opting out formed no part of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opting out has other origins. This morning my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) presented one of the originating documents of which the Minister was proud to describe himself as a co-author—the Minister shakes his head. I thought that he was anxious to accept the accolade of having penned this paper. No doubt he will clarify that when he speaks again. The document has been attributed to Right-wing groups within the Conservative party, in particular the Adam Smith Institute, which is becoming a repository for any daft idea. I am sure that Adam Smith would not be greatly impressed by some of the notions attributed to him.

The hon. Member for Eastwood began his political career as a benign chap. He became the Under-Secretary of State, Scottish Office with responsibility for education. I am pleased to say that he was not afflicted by any particular notions when he held that portfolio. Now that he has returned to the Back Benches he is determined to prove that underneath the benign exterior there is an unbridled Thatcherite trying to get out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry about that because opting out does not have any support in Scotland there seem to be some misgivings about it in the Cabinet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry about that because opting out does not have any support in Scotland, and there seem to be some misgivings about it in the Cabinet. It cannot be said that the Secretary of State for Education and Science is as sold on the idea as is the Minister responsible for education in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opting out is a half-baked idea which does not have the support of any substantial body of educationists. None of them says that the Minister responsible for education in Scotland and his hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) are right and that they should embrace the idea of opting out. I have not heard that from any respected source in Scotland. There is no support for such a proposal among parents. There may be a temporary demand for the proposal. It may be superficially attractive to parents who have a grievance with the education authority, but to latch on to that for opting out of a school in perpetuity seems to be a big step for any group of parents to take on behalf of other future parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the issues are considered in depth, as they would be if the Minister allowed the necessary consulation. I do not believe parents would embrace the idea. It poses serious hazards for Scottish education. It will undermine the education system and disrupt pupils' schooling. I can imagine the rows over opting out. Conservative Ministers have referred to parents, choice, but that presupposes that all parents will agree. That is a false premise. There will be an almighty row among parents about whether the school should opt out, and that will be a disruptive element in the school life. It will not add anything to the education of children, which should be our primary interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fancy that the idea has been prompted by a dislike of Labour-controlled local authorities. Conservatives do not control outright any education authorities in Scotland. That seems to have unleashed on Scottish Conservative Back Benchers a free-booting approach towards local authorities. I am sorry that education is one of those issues on which we should work to a consensus. But that is not happening with ideas being peddled for the worst of reasons by Conservative Back Benchers, who are being egged on by the Prime Minister's office, involving exchanges of letters between senior civil servants. The Minister today will have to argue against opting out, only to return to the idea next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>210</span>
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gordaan dealt ably with the argument about selection. The Government have not considered that issue properly. Perhaps the Minister will explain his views on selection and say whether this measure will have any influence on the move towards selection, which would be the next logical step to opting out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal is an attack on comprehensive education. Successive Conservative Administrations have not liked comprehensive education, and when it was introduced Conservative-controlled local authorities tried to ignore and flout the law. The then Secretary of State for Education had to go to great lengths to persuade some English local authorities to conform with the will of Parliament. That has been a Conservative stance—it is certainly that position of Right-wing Conservatives—and it is coming increasingly to the fore as ideas such as opting out gather momentum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the most worrying aspects of the proposal is that opting out is irrevocable. How can there be a choice to opt out, but not to opt back in? Once a school has opted out, it is out, and it cannot get back in. That is Hobson's choice, and is an odd proposal indeed. Surely a new generation of parents should be able to say, "We want to opt back into the state system. We accept that the parents of the last generation of children in the school wanted to opt out, but we want to opt back in to Strathclyde, Highland, Fife or whatever region." What is wrong with that? Why do not the new clause or the English Bill, provide for that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our worries are not founded merely on what the hon. Member for Eastwood has conjured up out of some crazy problem in his constituency. There is another view, and we are trying to express it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the Conservatives have hijacked the word "choice"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that, under opting out, we have a city with three schools. Two may decide to opt out, with parents sending their children to the opted-out schools. The third school could be run down to such an extent that it would have to close. Therefore, instead of having three schools, with coherent education provision and planning, the city could be left with only two schools. That would leave parents with fewer choices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government wrongly use the word "choice". Choice arises under an education system that is planned with long-term strategies and coherence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not dissent from that. I hope that Conservative Members will stop using the word "choice" as if they have suddenly discovered what it is. The Government's definition of choice limits other people's choice and rights. I hope that we shall persuade them of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried that the proposal will be detrimental to rural education. It is difficult to understand how opting out would work for rural schools, and what its implications would be for rural areas. Perhaps the hon. Member for Eastwood will deal with that when
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0869">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>211</span>
he responds to the debate. His thinking has been conditioned by the difficult circumstances surrounding the provision of education in his constituency and in Paisley. The hon. Gentleman has not thought beyond that and he has not thought about denominational education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal would create problems in the long run for denominational education because if such a school chose to opt out it would cause difficulties for parents who wished their children's education to be continued in the local authority system. It would involve bussing children even greater distances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The denominational sector would be ill advised to take on board the opting-out proposal or to see merit in the ideas to which the hon. Member for Eastwood and others have alluded. It is not in parents' interests: it will cause added stress within the denominational system and I do not believe that they will accept it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that we shall discuss denominational education again, particularly in the context of Aberdeen. I shall deal with the subject when we discuss representation on the boards because of the special circumstances that obtain in Aberdeen that are different from the experience and tradition in the west of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Member for Eastwood will join me in saying to parents of children in denominational schools that they should think carefully about putting pressure on the system now. They should not be persuaded that opting out has merit only in the context of one particular row with an education authority with which they have had excellent relations over a long period. That would be a mistake. I wish to say that as clearly as I can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we go for opting out, parents will find that they are sacrificing their local control and influence over education in favour of an ideologically motivated Scottish Education Department. I should prefer to deal with a local authority and local councillors whom I know well than deal with one junior Minister at the Scottish Department of Education and thousands of civil servants. It is a question of whether St. Andrew's house knows better than Strathclyde house or Grampian house. I am convinced that there is a strong case for local control and influence over education policy that would not be served by embracing these ideas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, schools operate not in single units isolated from the rest of the education framework but as integral parts of a team. There are feeder primaries to secondary schools, secondary schools that relate to colleges and colleges that relate to higher education establishments, and so on. They all work together, particularly in relation to tertiary provision. That system would be damaged by opting out, which assumes, wrongly, that the school community is a norrowly-based institution. It is a community institution with a much wider community interest, which is best served by a local authority that can take an overview of the different functions within the structure of education. That structure would be damaged, if not lost altogether, if the education authority operated only on behalf of some schools and the Minister responsible for education sought a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>212</span>
particular interest in the one or two schools that chose to opt out. That would be a grave mistake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, support services for schools are important. It is immensely important that there should be an advisory service at regional level, or divisional level in the case of the larger regional authorities, which is able to give specialist advice to head teachers and heads of departments in our secondary schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The child psychology service should support teachers in schools where there are children with particular problems. I do not believe that there is another way of providing that service efficiently except through the agency of the education authority serving the area. The school system is founded on the principle of working together for the common good of children and the common interest of the community. That would be lost if we were to go back to what would essentially be small private schools funded by the taxpayer. I do not like that idea one bit and my hon. Friends and I reject the concept. If it comes before us next year in the form of a major Bill, rather than as an amendment to this Bill, next year, I warn the Government and their supporters that there will be total warfare. There can be no consent to such a measure on the part of Her Majesty's Opposition or, for that matter, the education authority which our party controls. We would be bound to tell parents that we did not believe that such a measure was in the interests of their children or of providing education for the community generally. Such a measure would be substantially contested, and I hope that that message is clearly understood.

We shall certainly vote against the proposal put before the Committee by the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) on one matter at least—we have had a long debate. However, I detect a general feeling that a long speech from me that responded to every point raised in the debate might create a certain amount of restlessness, so I shall limit my remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth would be rather churlish to push his opposition to a Division when I have said that I would withdraw the amendment, but I regard that prospect with equanimity. The hon. Gentleman talked about local control and influence and that is partly what the issue is about, but the local control and influence that I am advocating is that of parents. The issue is about giving parents extra influence and choice in particular circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for what he said about some of the points of principle. I am grateful also to my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker), who shot down the allegation that the measure was wholly for rural areas. However, he pointed to a number of examples where there might be considerable demand in rural areas for opting out.

My right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) and

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>213</span>
my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Munro) urged caution. They did not want the Government to rush into opting out in the Bill, and it is clear that the Government have no such intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was extraordinary for the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) to quote the Secretary of State's comments on Second Reading as though they were different from what my hon. Friend the Minister said last Thursday when he used almost identical words to describe the Government's intention.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It became clear that Opposition Members' understanding of the issue increased as the debate progressed. I give them credit for that. Towards the end of the debate they showed some perception of the issue. That perception was entirely absent from the first speech from the Opposition Benches, made by the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall), who, surprisingly, did not deal with the issue at all. Opposition Members have almost exclusively tried to avoid the central issue I raised in moving amendment No. 10. That amendment is not related to my constituency, although Opposition Members allege continually that I moved the amendment because of the effects on my constituency of Strathclyde's proposals. It is true, of course, that the Paisley grammar school proposals affect my constituency in some measure, but it is not true to any significant extent of Notre Dame and Our Lady and St. Francis. There is an issue of principle there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dumbarton thought that the interests of parents are so negligible that he did not even refer to them, or try to knock down my arguments. The debate made it clear that the interests of Catholic and Moslem parents at those schools are of no concern whatsoever to the Labour party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton is not present to defend himself against that allegation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where is he?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that Conservative Members are in a position to ask where hon. Members are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have replied to the arguments of the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) on the amendment and the new clause on the basis of principles that they seek to include in the legislation. We have chosen not to speak on the short-term considerations raised by a difficulty arising in one consideration authority. We cannot legislate on that basis. Instead, we must consider what is best for Scottish education as a whole. It ill behoves the hon. Member for Eastwood to make a narrow point about Catholic education because that tactic will not reflect credit on the Conservative party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what the hon. Gentleman means. I was saying that it was clear from
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>214</span>
our debate that my case was one of principle because parents are being deprived of a school and of single sex education, which is a form of education that is important to them. It is clear that such parents do not count with the Labour party. When this morning I interjected from a sedentary position in the speech of the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish)—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not boasting of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret that, Mr. Knox; I must rephrase my remarks. When the hon. Member for Fife, Central, heard the remark, "What about Notre Dame?", he sneeringly said, "We are not talking about Paris". I think that is a disgraceful way for an hon. Gentleman to refer to the real worries of parents. Notre Dame and Our Lady and St. Francis are two schools that present an issue that the Labour party members of the Committee have failed to answer. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galloway) has faced it, and so has the chairman of the Strathclyde regional council education committee. Until late this morning, Opposition Members seemed to be under the misapprehension that opting out meant opting out of the state sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that Opposition Members are not under that misapprehension now. But it has taken several hours of debate for it to be understood. The hon. Member for Fife, Central was talking about opting out of the state sector this morning. Indeed, a major newspaper report on last Thursday's debate quoted the hon. Member for Dumbarton about opting out of the state sector. I emphasise that we are not talking about opting out of the state sector, nor about fee-paying schools. We are talking about choice in the state sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of the debate has centred on the question of whether there is a demand for opting out. It is clear that there is a demand in some areas. The hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth said that everyone should wholly support their local councillors and that that view was held by all parents. I could suggest some areas where the hon. Gentleman would receive less than wholehearted support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the question of trusting councillors, the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) failed to consider that in such places as my constituency, the Labour party has no councillors either at district or at regional level. It should be no surprise that people in North Tayside do not trust the Labour administration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Normal Hogg</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I can get a word in edgeways in my summing up, Mr. Knox, then I shall give way to the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of Paisley, I should be surprised if the hon. Gentleman could find anyone locally who supports what the regional council has proposed. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0871">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>215</span>
hon. Members for Paisley, North (Mr. Adams) and for Paisley, South (Mr. Buchan) do not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman insists on addressing the Committee in the context of a highly localised row between groups of parents about a few schools in the largest education authority in the United Kingdom except for the Inner London education authority. Such a basis for a new clause and for the concept of opting out is not the way to proceed. Legislation must be founded on the best principles for the whole of the system, involving all education authorities. I am amazed by the hon. Gentleman's comments about local councillors, but we are apparently supposed to believe that that is the position throughout the country. I do not accept that for Paisley, nor for the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unlike Socialists, I believe that minorities have rights. That is what the debate is all about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The poll previously referred to showed that 31 per cent. of those polled were in favour of opting out in Scotland. The hon. Member for Fife, Central criticised the question, which asked whether the majority of parents wished to opt out—the proposal takes effect only if the majority of parents wish to opt out. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) said, an entire policy cannot be based on an opinion poll. But I found that figure encouragingly high. My hon. Friend the Minister said that it was higher than the figure for support for the Conservative party in the same poll. That suggests that support for opting out is not limited to those who support the Conservative party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consultation, of course, is important, but there is a difference between a school board system which applies to every school in Scotland, with a few exceptions, and a system which protects minority rights. The majority might be against it, but it would still be proper for a Government to protect minority rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall mention briefly the points raised by Opposition Members because in replying to their questions about catchment areas, selection, finance, and so on, one can point to Jordanhill which has opted out by a different route, as the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) said. It is a grant-maintained, opted-out school which survives and relates to the education authority without the difficulties to which hon. Members referred. The details of matters raised by the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) would have to be pursued if we go ahead with the proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no conflict in principle between opting out and comprehensive education. It is possible, for example, for Our Lady and St. Francis to opt out, supported by the Minister, and to continue to be a comprehensive school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Worthington 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clydebank and Milngavie)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am just about to finish my contribution to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>216</span>
The essential division is between two groups. There are those who believe that in all possible circumstances, with certain exceptions, public sector education in Scottish schools should be left entirely to the education authority, despite objections and the fact that parents may be deprived of a school and of forms of education that they value for proper religious or cultural reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am just about to finish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not the proper stance for a Government. There are circumstances in which it would be right for the Secretary of State to enable a choice to be made and for there to be a form of education in a school which is supported by parents, despite the fact that the education authority did not wish that school to continue to exist. The essential divide is one of principle. I shall be happy to discuss other matters raised by hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that when I was not present in the Committee the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not criticise the hon. Gentleman for being out of the Committee for a moment. I said that he did not mention the interests of Catholic and Moslem children. I made Notre Dame and Our Lady and St. Francis the central case for opting out. If I am wrong about the hon. Gentleman's speech, I apologise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My speech referred to the principle of opting out as it affects Scotland. The fact that I did not mention particular schools should not be taken to mean that I am not interested in them. I taught in the denominational sector for 15 years and my children are in that sector. I am interested in every aspect of Scottish education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I seek your guidance, Mr. Knox? The view of the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), which is not one that I share, was that the proposal would not require the same consultation as the proposal for the school boards on the grounds that it would not affect every school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the proposal could potentially affect every school, so the hon. Gentleman's point was not valid. I do not wish to demean his position—he is entitled to his views, as I am to mine—but I am concerned that the Minister, who intervened frequently to try to clarify his thinking,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0872">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>217</span>
did not respond to that specific point. I wonder, through you, Mr. Knox, whether the Minister will now clarify his position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is nothing to do with the Chair. If the Minister wishes to respond, he can do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to deal with the point. We have made it clear that we have no proposals for opting out in Scotland. We have also made it clear that we would be willing to consider such proposals. It would be premature to consider what, if any, form the consultation should take before we had reached a decision. The hon. Gentleman is jumping the gun.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remain concerned about the matter. Having heard the debate, which has now run for several hours in Committee, and which will run for weeks and months throughout the country, for the Minister to say that it is premature and that it would be inappropriate to clarify the position on consultation seems less then satisfactory. The hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) supported my argument that the proposal is radical. The Minister would be proud of it as a radical idea. Indeed, he has claimed credit for it in his interviews with the press. It is reasonable for him to make it clear through the Committee to a wider public that the Government will not introduce such a proposal without full consultation with parents and teachers in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is saying that he does not intend to carry out consultation, but that he will bring forward a Bill simply on the basis of his views and what has been said in the Committee, that is unsatisfactory. It is not much to ask of him to say that he accepts the need for extensive consultation and that he will undertake such a process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must not put words into my mouth to suit his argument. I have made it perfectly clear that the Government have no proposals for opting out. If we do so in the future, obviously we shall consider the arguments which have been advanced in the Committee, including those of the hon. Gentleman about the need to consult. It is quite ridiculous of the hon. Gentleman to suggest that I am evading the issue, and that I should be making pronouncements about the form of consultation on proposals that we have not introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the hon. Gentleman's anxiety that if we introduce proposals for opting out they should be subject to consultation, but he really must wait until such time as the Governmen have made a decision. We have made it clear that, while we would not stand in the way of opting out, we have not decided to introduce such legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am genuinely not trying to be combative about the issue. The Minister must understand that there is a great deal of concern about the Government's intentions. He could allay that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>218</span>
anxiety and justify his confidence in his argument by simply saying that the Government will carry out full consultation. He has not said that that is his intention, but he has not said that it is not. It is regrettable that he has not, at least, allayed our anxiety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal is radical. It needs more than a debate on a new clause which we knew from the outset would not be accepted by the Government. An extensive consultation comparable to that which was carried out before the Bill was introduced would be essential if the proposal were introduced. Anything short of extensive consultation would be regrettable. The idea that the Bill requires full consultation, but that opting out proposals do not, is neither consistent nor acceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If the hon. Gentleman is called, he is being called to make a speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek clarification on the same point. To use the in-phrase, the Minister is being "economical with the truth". The Secretary of State is under clear instructions from No. 10 Downing Street to produce an opting-out proposal in a future Bill. There is not the slightest doubt about that. We know who rules the roost in the Scottish Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has frequently praised the success of the consultation exercise on the school boards proposal. It is clear that an opting-out proposal will be put forward at the behest of the Prime Minister. It is not premature—it is necessary for the people of Scotland—for the Minister to give an undertaking now that there will be full consultation, similar to that for the school boards proposal, if an opting-out proposal is introduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to speak on a separate issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I want to make it clear that if I call hon. Members now they should rise to make speeches and not to intervene in another hon. Member's speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make a short speech, Mr. Knox. I sat patiently waiting for the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) or the Minister to respond to the points that I raised in my earlier contribution, but neither of them did so. I appeal to them to deal with those points. Under the proposal for schools to opt out of the education authority system, would education authorities still have the power to define the catchment areas of such schools, or would that be a matter for the school boards? If the demand for places in an opted-out school exceeded the availability of places, would its school board be able to establish criteria for selection of pupils? Could it set examinations or other criteria to select the intake when the demand for places exceeded availability?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In order to make progress, I had not intended to say anything because the points had been covered and now new points had been

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>219</span>
raised. I tried to intervene when specific points were raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie asked what will happen in the future. I cannot say. The Government have taken no decision to introduce legislation for opting out of schools in Scotland. I do not know how often I have to say that to convince Opposition Members. It is an are-you-still-beating-your-wife question to ask me what form consultations will take prior to the Government taking any decision to introduce such legislation. Some hon. Members are new to the House, but all Opposition Members know that it would be pretty unusual for legislation to be introduced without some form of consultation. I will not be trapped into making commitments about consultation on legislation that the Government have not yet decided to introduce. It is a daft question for hon. Members to ask, including the hon. Member for Gordon who has now left the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East asked me about schools in England which were to opt out. I thought that I made the point clear in an intervention in the hon. Gentleman's speech that under the English Bill opted-out schools are required to accept placing requests. The English Bill contains special provisions which prevent artificial restrictions on entry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand the hon. Gentleman's point about catchment areas. Opted-out schools would no longer be local authority schools and local authorities set their own catchment areas, so the problem would not arise. If his question is about how difficult it is for local authorities to plan if people move from one catchment area to a school elsewhere, that is the current position under the parents' charter. Many parents use the rights that the Government have given them to send their children to schools outwith the catchment zone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That has caused many problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A noticeable number of children at Paisley grammar school and other schools mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood are there as a result of parental placing requests. There is also a noticeable correlation, as research carried out for the Scottish Education Department has shown, between schools that receive many parental placing requests and those which achieve good academic results.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which schools does the Minister have in mind when he makes that statement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will allow me, I shall send him a copy of the research that has been done for the Department, part of which was done in Edinburgh, so that he can make his own judgment. I do not know whether he has made any progress in obtaining the survey carried out by the Glasgow division on schools' performance in Strathclyde. If he studies that survey he will find that the schools which attract many placing requests are also those
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>220</span>
which do well in examinations. He will also find that some of those schools have been earmarked for closure by Strathclyde.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to detain the Committee much longer. I am sure that I speak at least for Conservative Members in saying that I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood for tabling his new clause and indeed, for saying that he will ask leave of the Committee to withdraw it. It has produced what will be, I hope, the longest debate in the Committee—on a matter, ironically, which is not even included in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to prolong your agony, Mr. Knox, but will the Minister assure the Committee that no legislation will be brought forward in this Parliament to introduce opting-out in Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the debate comes to an end, I wish to put something clearly on the record. The Minister—I do not know whether it was wittingly or unwittingly—answered a question that I put to him. When he said that if a school in a local authority's catchment area opted out the education authority would have to re-draw its catchment areas because the opted-out school would no longer be subject to them. He implied that education authorities would have to re-draw all their catchment areas. The opted-out school will have to consider placing requests, but there will be no artificial constraints. When that school is absolutely full and has a waiting list, the school board will select who should be given access to the school by establishing its own selection criteria. That is what opting out has always been about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Eastwood suggested that he wished to withdraw the amendment a few minutes ago. Unfortunately, other hon. Members have spoken since then, so I must put the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 15, in page 1, line 18, leave out "on the first occasion".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a probing amendment intended to elicit from the Minister precisely what is meant by the phrase "on the first occasion". Does it mean that the board is established when it meets, or does it mean something else? It is not clear why that wording is in the Bill. The only purpose of the amendment is to clarify that. If the Minister will do so, we can move on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see the point that the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) makes. The words "on the first occasion" are included simply to avoid any possible doubt. It means that boards are established on the first occasion that a successful election is held. It makes it clear that the board comes into existence after the first set of elections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I tabled the amendment because I have never understood what a discontinued school was. We have heard a lot about school closures in the course of the past six hours and 13 minutes, but none of us talked about discontinuing a school. Strathclyde region does not have any discontinuance proposals, its worry is school closures. I am seeking to find out why the Minister has used this strange word "discontinued".

Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) for the plain English campaign. The difference between a closed school and a discontinued school would arise where two schools were to be amalgamated. In the case of an amalgamation the term "discontinued" would cover the school concerned in a way that "closed" would not. It is the standard term used in the 1980 Act. The term is found in section 22(1) and (2)(b)(i) and (ii) of that Act. I share the hon. Gentleman's affection for the word "closed", but it would not cover all circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You will have noticed, Mr. Knox, that your provisional selection covers a large number of points. Perhaps it would assist the Committee if I were to go through the amendments slowly. We wish to approach clause 2 in the spirit of persuading the Government that there is strong case for changing the composition of boards from that which they have set out in the Bill. That will be the thrust of our arguments about clause 2 and schedule 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During our consideration of the original paper published by the Minister, and of the Bill, we have argued that it would be a great mistake to give any one grouping such influence over a board's deliberations. A school board should represent the consensus that exists within the community. The school, the authority and the teachers should advance education and effect the legislation that is already on the statute book. That legislation provides that the education authority shall ensure that educational provision is made at that place and in accordance with the statute. Our approach to school boards, from the paper that we submitted to the Minister when he
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>224</span>
published his original proposals to the tabling of the amendments, is founded on the belief that the school should be a place of partnership between parents and teachers, aimed at achieving excellence in education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are not going to hijack the word "excellence" as they have hijacked "choice". Everyone involved in education wishes to promote excellence. It is not a concept that the Minister is about to discover nor is it an idea tucked away in an obscure pamphlet written in one of our east coast universities. Excellence is sought as strongly on the Opposition Benches as it is anywhere else, and we have tabled the amendments because we believe that it is important that that objective is served.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately the Government are proposing to create an artificail situation in which parents alone will control the thinking inside a school board. We have received an extraordinary letter from the Minister, setting out his views on representation. I am sure that today or at some other time he will want to take the opportunity to say how he arrived at the ratio that is contained within it. It is not clear to me why that specific ration should be considered right. It cannot have surprised the Minister that there has been outright condemnation of his proposals from eduction sources in Scotland. A barrage of criticism was reported in this week's edition of 	<i>The Times Educational Supplement Scotland,</i> which I am sure that the Minister reads with the same enthusiasm as I do, even if it takes a wee while.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of what is unseen to us, I confirm that I read it with considerable enthusiasm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be more appropriate to discuss the structure of the boards when we discuss amendments Nos. 44 and 46 because of the wide range of issues that we must cover on this group of amendments. If it will help the hon. Gentleman, I think that the issues arising from the amendments are parental majority, co-opted members and the definitions of "parent", for example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not unhappy to do that if it will serve the convenience of the Committee. I certainly wish to discuss these matters in some depth, and I give notice that we expect the Minister to justify the arrangement that he has come up with for parent members, staff members and co-opted members on school boards. If he can deal with it under amendments Nos. 44 and 46—as I speak am making sure that I know what those amendments contain—we agree that he should do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman. It is a difficult subject. This is a complex group of amendments and I have the advantage of having the departmental briefing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments No. 44 and 46 deal specifically with the structure and regulations. These are important

issues that the Committee will wish to discuss in detail and which can be debated then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>6.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely "parent" in amendment No. 40 requires definition. The Minister should consider whether the definition in section 135 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 should be applied because it includes
	<br><q><p>"guardian and any person who is liable to maintain or has the actual custody of a child or young person".</p></q>
Such a meaning would avoid the inclusion of parents of adults attending school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has raised an interesting point by way of what I think was an intevention designed to help me. For the record, it was very helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumfries)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman explain it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. My hon. Friend said that we should consider the definition of "parent" for the purposes of the Bill. That raises the interesting question of who will vote on behalf of children who are in the care of the local authority. It would be helpful if the Minister would respond to that question. Many children are under care orders, with foster parents and so on. Who would represent their interests on a school board?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to detain members of the Committee, who have been patient for a long time today over the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Eastwood, which has exercised us deeply. However, I should like an answer to the question. Who is a parent within the terms of this Bill and what provision has been made to care for the interests of a child who is under the care of a local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to speak to this group of amendments because with it is taken amendment No. 9, which appears in the names of my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) and myself. The group of amendments is important. As you said, Mr. Knox, amendments Nos. 44 and 46 will be taken later, but it will be rather difficult to divorce them from the issues being debated under these amendments. My views on these issues might have been tempered if we had already had a debate on amendments Nos. 44 and 46, and in some respects this debate is a tentative, paving debate for debates on later amendments. Although I agree that amendments Nos. 44 and 46 refer more specifically to the structure of membership of the boards, I hope that you will forgive me, Mr. Knox, if I stray briefly into considering some of their implications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us who support the school boards and the main thrust of the Bill are seeking greater parental involvement. I have made my views clear and do not intend to repeat them. I do not seek to set up
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>226</span>
a new rival management structure for our schools because the management of our schools is legally in the hands of the education authority, and the management of each individual school is properly in the hands of the head teacher. Those are the two centres of management for which I hope nothing in the Bill will cause difficulty or conflict.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My views about the school boards are coloured by my belief that their main function, with some exceptions, is consultative. It is a function which parents will share with others on the boards, and with the education authority, the head teacher and others in the school. If the function is primarily consultative and also primarily to achieve better partnership in our schools between parents, teachers and the education authority, I am somewhat concerned—which is why my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries and I tabled amendment No. 9—about any one group being in a majority on the school board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a management function, I can understand that there might be some advantage in one group having a majority simply to provide a degree of certainty and leadership. That is a debatable point, but if we had management functions I would not be absolutely certain on which side I would come down on the argument. If the boards had a management function, there is something to be said for one group being in overall majority because it could give more certainty and thrust to the policies of the school board. But we are dealing with a consultative function, and are trying to get greater involvement. Therefore, I question whether it is necessary or right that one particular group should have a majority over the other groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, if there were no co-options to the board, I should have thought that it was probably right that one group should have a majority. I would agree that, given the purpose of the board, it would have been better for the parental group to have had a majority rather than the teachers' group. After all, we are trying to draw parents into it more. There again, in other circumstances which are not covered by the Bill, I could see a point in having a parental majority on the board. But if we are to have co-opted members to the board, I do not see anything like the same argument for having one particular group in a majority. I hope that the boards do not always divide down the lines of the groups to which members belong. If there were divisions and votes on the boards—which I hope would not happen too often—I would hope to see a lot of cross sections and divisions between parents and co-opted members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The moment we co-opt members to the board, whatever arguments my hon. Friend the Minister advances in favour of having the parents as a majority are to some extent weakened. In tabling the amendment I am trying to probe my hon. Friend's intentions. I could understand having parents in the majority on a management board, although I do not say that I agree with it. I could understand parents being in the majority if there were no co-opted members, but I require a certain amount of persuasion to convince me that parents have necessarily to be in a majority, given that the boards
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0877">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>227</span>
are consultative and that they have co-opted members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, this is where I stray on to amendments Nos. 44 and 46, but as they colour my views on this amendment, it is only fair to mention that now. I am deeply worried by my hon. Friend's consultation paper on the composition of the school boards, particularly as schools with up to 500 pupils will be represented by only one staff member. My hon. Friend the Minister will respond by saying that, as the head teacher will also serve on the board, albeit without a vote, theoretically there will be two staff representatives. However, only one staff member will be elected to the board, and the other will be there ex officio.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although that makes sense in a very small school, a school approaching that ceiling of 500 pupils would have quite a large staff of between 30 and 40 members. In such schools an intolerable burden would be placed on the one member of staff who must represent all of his colleagues. That makes me even more worried about the parental majority, as proposed in the Bill. In the consultation paper, by contrast, staff interests seem to be numerically subjugated to parent interests on particular school boards. If there are prospects of increasing the number of staff members at a later stage, I might consider the proposal slightly differently. The consultation paper proposes an unbalanced board, and it is all the more unbalanced to give parents a built-in majority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall finish where I began. I remind my hon. Friend the Minister that the new structure seeks greater involvement and co-operation, and is about people working together. My main worry is that the Bill could lead to boards not working as coherently as I should like them to. The boards should work in a spirit of co-operation and take account of different interests. I look forward to hearing my hon. Friend's response. In a sense, I am probing and seeking an explanation, but I shall require convincing as to whether the Bill is right as it stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak briefly in support of amendment No. 52, tabled in my name. Indeed, amendments Nos. 52 and 47 have the same purpose as amendment No. 9, about which the right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) has just spoken. They seek to ensure that, although parents will be the largest group, they will not have a majority on the school boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the school board proposals were an extention of the powers of school councils, as many of us wished, I would have agreed that parents should have a majority. That would have ensured that school councils had the authority to do some of the things which their parent members feel have been ignored. Nevertheless, in principle there is no body on which parents should legitimately have a majority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, a much greater scope is envisaged for the new boards, even in the lower proposals without possible further development. It seems inappropriate, if we are trying to promote partnership between teachers, the community, parents and pupils, that one group should be given a majority over the others. Clearly, the amendments seek to curtail that majority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>228</span>
At the end of last week I visited the head teacher of a primary school in my constituency. She is a good, committed head teacher and was expressing real concern about the implications of the proposals for a school board, on whcih she would not have a vote but which would direct here on the basis of a parent majority. She said that the overwhelming majority of parents who took an active interest in the school were constructive and supportive, but one or two had definitive views which they wished to force across. She said that although she did not object to those strongh-minded parents being on the board, she could not prevent their views from prevailing if they could persuade a majority of parents. As a head teacher worried about her school, she felt that that was an imbalance to her disadvantage and would make it difficult for her to carry out the job appropriately. She said that if those pressures became too intense, she could envisage that teachers would opt out of teaching.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to make too much of that, but the Minister should not make light of that genuine anxiety among teachers. Why does he think that it is right that parents should have an absolute majority on the boards? I do not wish to anticipate later debates, such as giving the head teacher a vote, altering the balance between teachers, or allowing teachers to stand as parent representatives if they are parents. But it is right to stress that the Government have put forward proposals assuming a parental majority which they have not justified and about which parents and teachers are anxious. There should be a partnership. Every group should have a legitimate say and at least two associated groups should vote together to ensure a feeling of unity of purpose, of teamwork and of partnership. A group of parents should not impose their will on teachers and others involved in the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are trying to amend the sense of imbalance. I hope that the Minister will acknowledge that those anxieties are widely-felt and genuine and perhaps alter his formulation for teacher representatives, or accept, in principle, some of the later amendments which would offer a balance by, for example, allowing a head teacher to vote, or parents who are teachers to stand. A teacher with a child at the school at which he or she teaches should be entitled to stand. Parents should determine whether they wish that teacher to represent their interests. As long as that person is elected by parents, it is wrong to debar him or her from standing. We shall have an opportunity to debate that more fully later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing amendments that come from the Social and Liberal Democrats, the Labour party and the Conservative party, so the Minister must understand that we are talking about partnership. To give one group a majority is not a partnership.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am worried about the numbers game for the school boards. That is at the heart of the discussion about who will have the majority. I am grateful to the Minister for taking the trouble to write to let us know what he thinks about the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0878">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>229</span>
composition of the boards. But I am astonished that he should have as few as seven board members for a school of up to 500 pupils, which is a big school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Distances are great in Scotland and the weather can sometimes be appalling. Elected parents, co-opted members, or the staff member may not even get to the meeting when such a small number is involved. The staff member may be ill. There may be no representative from the staff. Will we arrange for alternative members from parents, staff and co-opted members? I am surprised that the minimum is not about 15 members for a school of 500 pupils. That would give a greater coverage and a leavening of views. Four parents may not be representative of the broad views of the majority of parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It could be difficult for parents to select four members from 1,000 parents. The parents will know each other only rarely. We do not know what the quorum will be, but a small number on the board will complicate the practical working of that board in terms of attendance. If there are only seven members, the quorum will be very small, and it may be difficult to maintain that quorum under certain circumstances, such as illness or bad weather.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should consider doubling the figures. A school with 1,500 pupils is very big. I hope that we do not aim to have such big schools in the future. I would rather we aimed at 800 or 1,000 pupils than as many as 1,500. Only seven parents and three members of staff out of a school of 1,500 is an extremely small number. One cannot compare school children with employees, but it would be surprising if a business employing 500 people had only seven members on the board. One would expect more non-executive and executive directors than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My views are clouded because I think that the numbers for the practical running of the board have been underestimated. My right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) who tabled amendment No. 9 has introduced a point for debate. I am looking forward to hearing the Minister's views and the views of the Opposition Front Bench before making up my mind on the issue. I hope that the Minister will go into the issue of the proposed membership of the board, because he has grossly underestimated the number of people required to carry out the work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) showed a touching faith in the Minister's intentions, when he said that school boards would have a purely consultative role. However, there is no question of that. School boards may take over the management of the school. The mechanism exists in the Bill for school boards to appeal to the Secretary of State if they disagree with their education authority. The Secretary of State will be the means whereby school boards will be able to take over the management and running of a particular school. The right hon. Gentleman reminds me of Red Riding Hood because he has mistaken a wolf for his kindly old granny.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman should put his glasses on more securely. He will then be able to see the wolf sitting on the Government Front Bench.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with a complex group of 14 amendments. I understood from the exchange between the Minister and my hon Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg), that the debate should revolve around three central issues. The first issue is the definition of "parent" in clause 2, the second the co-opted members, and the third the parental majority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of amendment No. 40 would be to leave out clause 2(1)(a) which deals with parent members being elected by parents of pupils at the school. According to the notes on clauses the definition of "parent" is that given in the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 which states:
	<br><q><p>" 'parent' includes guardian and any person who is liable to maintain or has the actual custody of a child or young person".</p></q>
The Minister must clarify that definition. Is he satisfied that it meets all the circumstances relating to the impact of the clause?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth has already dealt with children who are in the care of the local authority and who will be the guardian or the person who is able to maintain the child or has custody of the young child. Who will exercise their vote in the elections to the school boards? The question is not purely hypothetical. When I was a schoolteacher in Balgowan List D school in Dundee, a group of children in that school were sent out daily to attend local authority schools. I suppose that their legal guardian would have been the school itself. Who exercises the vote on the part of the school? Will the board of management in that school exercise the right to vote on behalf of the pupil who attended a local authority school? It is important for the Minister to clarify the circumstances? For example, will the children's home run by the regional council or the social work committee exercise the right to vote? The Minister must tackle that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another factor relates to broken marriages, which are becoming increasingly prevalent in Scotland. There has been a marked increase in the number of broken marriages. In cities and in rural areas, people may live together but not necessarily be married. One partner who is the legal guardian may have moved out of the family home and another, who is not the legal guardian, may have moved in. Will the Minister make it clear who has the right to vote in such circumstances, as a parent, in elections? It is important that we know that, as the Bill does not make it clear. Indeed, in my constituency some parents have been so irresponsible that the responsibility of ensuring that their children attend school and of exercising parental care has devolved to elder daughters or sons. If they are responsible for looking after children, will they have the right or privilege to vote in those children's school elections—or will that be left to parents who shun responsibility and take no real interest in their children? The Minister must respond to those questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>231</span>
Amendment No. 20 would omit clause 2(1)(c) which refers to
	<br><q><p>"persons (to be known as 'co-opted members'), who shall be co-opted by the Board".</p></q>
According to the Bill, "co-opted members" has the meaning given to it in clause 2(1)(c). But clearly the only meaning given to such members is that they are:
	<br><q><p>"persons … who shall be co-opted by the Board".</p></q>
That does not tell us much about who such members will be. If co-opted members are to be on school boards, criteria should be clearly established to decide who they will be. Who will have the right to be a co-opted member on a school board? The Minister must make that absolutely clear. We know, for instance, that denominational schools—which in the main in Scotland are Roman Catholic schools—will have the right to be represented by co-opted members. But what about the Church of Scotland and other church interests in Scotland? Will they have the right to have co-opted members on school boards?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most Committee members will have received correspondence from the committee of education of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland about its concern that the Bill appears to exclude it from the right of representation on school boards. It points out that for a long time the Church of Scotland has been directly involved in the nation's education system and has statutory representation on regional councils' education committees. Indeed, the importance of those with an interest in religious education has always been mirrored, not only in education authority education committees, but in school councils. It is therefore important that the interests of the Church of Scotland and other church groups within Scottish society are reflected on the school boards. Will the Minister allow such representation under the co-opted members provision?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other groups now take an increasing interest in the affairs of a given local area—for example, ethnic minority groups. The hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) professed to have great concern for ethnic minorities. Let us suppose that a school is located in an area with a large ethnic minority population. Will there be room for representation of that ethnic minority population on the school board?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the most recent marked tendencies in Scottish life has been the increase in pensioners grouping together to demand that their interests be reflected. "Grey Power" is promoted by Jack Jones, who had given a tremendous lifetime's service to the Labour movement. He is now giving an equally tremendous service to pensioners and is making sure that "grey power" is felt at every level. Pensioners have an interest in how schools are run and they may wish to be represented on school boards. Will they be able to take on a co-opted member status?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we broke for dinner, I was dealing with amendment No. 20 on the subject of co-opted members of school boards. I pointed out that there is little guidance in the Bill as to who can be considered as co-opted members of the school boards. All that the Bill says is that co-opted members are
	<br><q><p>"persons … who shall be co-opted by the Board",</p></q>
and that gives the boards wide discretionary powers in deciding who should be co-opted members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that the Minister should give guidance as to which groups are eligible and appropriate for representation on school boards, and I suggested that as well as denominational groups in denominational schools, we should consider also other churches in Scotland, for instance, the Methodist church, as well as ethnic minorities, pensioner groups, district councils and community groups such as tenants' associations and neighbourhood watch schemes. All such groups use schools and are affected by any decisions that are taken by school boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely, such groups have more right to be considered for co-option than, for example, business interests in the local community. It would be deplorable if school boards were influenced by people with business interests who sought to use their position on school boards simply to ensure that the curricula followed by schools were geared entirely towards the interests of local business and industry, and if they were employment oriented instead of having the broad-based approach to education that up to now has been the hallmark of Scottish education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We seek to confine the debate to a number of key issues, another being the parental majority on school boards. The Minister made it clear that in his view, the parental majority is essential, and that if, following the election, there were no parental majority on a school board, that board would not be allowed to come into existence. That consideration is critical in the Minister's view, but in that he is somewhat isolated, not only in Scotland but within the ranks of Conservative Back Benchers in this Committee, a number of whom have expressed their anxiety at the idea of having a parental majority on school boards. In making parental majority such a focal point, the Minister is establishing a siuation of conflict in school boards between that parent majority and the other legitimate interests that are represented on school boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I received a copy of a letter that was sent to the Minister by Greenfield primary school in my constituency, in which it was made very clear that such a board should have equal representation of parents and teachers. That is a recurring theme in responses to the Bill, as is the idea that it is essential to have co-operation on any school board, as on a school council or any other body in Scottish
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0880">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>233</span>
education, and that groups should work together. There is no sense in one group being dominated by another. Certainly, we do not want parents to be excluded from school boards, because they have an important contribution to make. We would be very happy for them to constitute 50 per cent. of the boards, but, in my view, it would be detrimental for boards to have a parental majority, especially in circumstances where, as the Minister has already conceded, it was possible for elections to school boards to be conducted on a party-political basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In such cases, it would be possible for the parent majority on a school board to represent a party-political view. Four parent members could be elected on a party political ticket and dominate that school board in such a way as to alienate the staff members of that board by co-opting those people whom they felt were sympathetic to their views. That would be terrible for Scottish education. There has to be a counterweight against that potential politicisation of school boards. One of the ways in which to ensure that there is not a parent majority on the board could be for it to be counterposed by other interests representing a wider community of staff, churches, community groups and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To conclude, I shall return to the definition of parents, because clause 2(1)(a) says that parent members
	<br><q><p>"shall be elected by, parents of pupils in attendance at the school".</p></q>
The phrase
	<br><q><p>"in attendance at the school"</p></q>
disfranchises important groups of parents who have a legitimate interest in being represented on a school board. For example, I am thinking about parents of pre-school children who are about to enrol their children at a school, a school board election is held and those parents are excluded from any participation in that election even though their children will be attending that school in a few short months. That also applies to the parents of primary 7 school children who are about to transfer to a secondary school at the age of 12. I am in that position myself because my son is about to transfer to Lawside academy in Dundee after the summer holiday. However, if a school board election were held now I could not participate in that election, and, when the school opens in August, I would be the parent of a son attending that school who was excluded from that election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure as drafted gives rights to parents in the opposite position to mine. A parent may have a child at school who is coming to the end of his fourth year, but that parent can take part in the school board election although his child will leave at 16. He will have participated in an election for a school board knowing that he will have no children at that school when it reopens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should consider the probelms presented by the phrase
	<br><q><p>"in attendance at the school"</p></q>
because it does not cover the groups I have mentioned, and it is important for them to be enfranchised. If their children are shortly to join a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>234</span>
school it is important for parents to have the right to take part in school board elections and to have their voices represented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has not been the best of nights for finding one's cue. When I spoke to this group of amendments I left out co-option and, indeed, it was co-option that I wanted to talk about. But such is the nature of these debates that I was scrabbling around trying to find out what I had tabled the amendments about. However, now that I have gathered my thoughts I shall direct the Committee's attention to co-option.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My colleagues and I are not clear as to why the Government have made provision for the co-option of members of school boards. Why should a board be able to co-opt a member to serve on its committee? We have had co-option to education authorities in the past. That has been largely to protect the interests of the church, because historically it had a role in the provision of education which has continued to the present time. We have in our education authorities, for example, representatives of the Church of Scotland and of the Roman Catholic diocese. I can understand that, but I am not clear why members should be co-opted to school boards. When the Minister replies to the debate, will he tell us why the provision exists?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will also tell us who he envisages will be co-opted. I hope that the provision is not simply a means of providing extra support for the parental majority, about which he has spoken, and that a board will not consist of seven parents and somebody's grannie. There is a strong suspicion that the Minister is anxious to reinforce the parental majority with someone who will simply support that majority. I hope that he will assure me that that is not what is envisaged.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or the local branch of the CBI, or the Rotary club. I would be extremely unhappy if that were the definition of "community". I want to know how the Minister envisages that such community co-option will take place. Who will decide what community interest is, in terms of a school board? How will that be reflected in the appointment of someone to the school board? The Minister may opt out—if that is not an overworked phrase in the Committee—by saying that when the school board has been set up, it will be trusted to appoint a person or persons to represent the community interest. That would not be good enough. It would mean that parents could co-opt someone whom they wanted to be elected and who was not elected. That is an old one. We have seen it before in education committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill provides for the categories of candidates to be mutually exclusive, so it would not be possible to co-opt someone who did not get elected.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely right. The Bill provides that no one who is eligible for election can be appointed or co-opted. The Minister is absolutely right. That was an oversight on my part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister, at some point in tonight's proceedings, define what the community is, in the context of school boards? Who does he see making those appointments? I hope that he will not simply say that the board can appoint whom it likes. That would not do. I would prefer the Bill to be specific, but I am unhappy about co-option anyway. The provision is redundant. Education authorities have inherited co-option because of the historical background of the development of education in Scotland. We do not need to import it into school boards. It is one thing for parents and school staff to have an influence over the management of schools, but when we start talking about "other interests", we are widening the scope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members want education authorities to continue to have the important role of determining education policy and its execution in schools. If the Bill provides for the importation of persons who are not directly involved in the teaching, management or administration of schools, who are not parents and who have no such direct interest, I oppose the proposals for co-option. That is why we tabled the amendments. I hope that the Minister will feel able to give some definition on our questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be for the convenience of the Committee at this late hour if I respond to some of the questions on the amendments. I know that when we meet next Tuesday members of the Committee may wish to develop the arguments about the composition of the boards and especially the parental majorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>236</span>
Amendment No. 40 would remove altogether the requirement for parent members and amendments Nos. 20, 24, 80, 84, 83, 86, 88 and 117 would remove the provisions on co-opted members about which the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) is concerned. His innovation in amendment No. 21 would introduce a new category of elected community members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall begin with the question by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) about the precise definition of "a parent". He rightly said that the definition refers to those other than natural parents—for example, local authorities with children in their charge—who on the face of it would be required to cast a vote, and he asked what the arrangement would be in such circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no point in not conceding that the question, "Who is the parent?" has some unusual answers. The question arises from the definition in the Education (Scotland) Act 1980. I do not see the provision as a weakness. On the contrary, it is sense and reflects the real world. As the hon. Member for Dundee, East has said, because of divorce or other reason sometimes more than two people have responsibility for a child. The Bill gives rights of involvement—that is, ability to stand as a parent member and to vote in elections—to those who have duties under the 1980 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill also provides that someone—in this instance the local education authority—must determine who falls within the definition of a parent in local cases. I would not expect that a local authority with a child in its care would exercise its right to cast a vote in school board elections, but the hon. Member for Dundee, East is right to point to a difficulty. I am reluctant to move away from the definition in the 1980 Act, but if Opposition Members and my hon. Friends press me, I am happy to look at the provision again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It occurred to me during our break that there is a problem with foster parents. The social work department of Strathclyde regional council, an authority that covers many children in care, has encouraged fostering as opposed to any other means of care. Will foster parents be given rights in this matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the purpose of these cases it is possible for a child to have three or even more parents—one could work out examples. That follows from the 1980 Act and has always been the case. The definition of a parent, apart from having the natural meaning, also includes
	<br><q><p>"guardian and any person who is liable to maintain or has the actual custody of a child or young person".</p></q>
That is logical, although on the face of it it seems extraordinary, in so far as we are giving rights to those who have duties to the child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We could look at the definition and consider whether to amend it on Report. I have an open mind on the matter. As it stands in the Bill the definition is defensible, although some situations may seem strange. The hon. Member for Dundee, East cited an example. The hon. Member for Cumbernauld and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0882">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>237</span>
Kilsyth raised the question of grannies. I can foresee grannies getting a vote because of adults attending schools. I shall take account of the Committee's views. I am in its hands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that the number of people entitled to vote in an election will be increased, or will the range of options be increased while retaining the numbers at one or two per child?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Committee feels that the parents of adults attending school should not have votes, or that we should seek to take out of the franchise for school board votes local authorities that are charged with the care of youngsters, I shall be happy to consider the matter. We have left the 1980 definition because it is defensible and has a relationship between duties and rights, although I acknowledge that it is difficult to explain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At a press conference during the early stages of developing this legislation an official in the Scottish Office pointed out that it was possible for a child to have three parents. There were bemused looks from the press, but that is the effect of the definition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested to know what the situation will be in regard to a pupil in the care of a local authority. The Minister said that he would consider the matter and might be prepared to take away from local authorities the right to exercise a vote on behalf of that pupil in a school board direction. Will he consider the possibility of a local authority nominating an individual who has particular responsibility for a child and is closely related to that child to exercise the ballot on behalf of that pupil?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Bill stands, there is provision for that. Determining who has the right is a question for the local authority—the local authority could take that view. That is why I have said that it is up to members of the Committee to express their views. If there is a strong feeling that the position should be changed, I am prepared to take account of that. I am happy with the present position, otherwise the Bill would not be in its present form, but the hon. Gentleman rightly pressed me to explain the exact position and I have done so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am fascinated by amendment No. 40, tabled by the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth. The Opposition have been at pains to express their commitment to parental involvement. We have discussed avoiding the need for school boards. The Opposition demonstrate their commitment to parental involvement by seeking to remove the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>238</span>
parental majority and parent members, which would be the effect of amendment No. 40. The hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth will say that I am being unfair, because the amendment must be considered in its context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister will understand that our technique is to table amendments which require the Minister to explain exactly what a clause or subsection means. We are asking him to define "parent member", hence our questions about who is a parent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I assumed that the amendment was required to meet the new category of community representation which consists of people who are elected to the school board by the parents and staff. I did not see what lay behind the amendment as clearly as I should have done. Whatever the reason, the hon. Gentleman spoke about co-opted members and seemed hostile to the view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the original proposals, which were circulated for consultation purposes, we suggested that people might be drawn from business and from the church. As a result of the response to the proposals, we moved from that position to one in which the boards would be free to co-opt whomsoever they liked, provided that they were not within the categories eligible for election. That would give an opportunity, when the parent and teacher members had been elected, for the board to fill any gaps in expertise or knowledge, and give local flexibility. Hon. Members have been pressing me on the need to avoid too much being prescribed from the centre, and I hoped that they would welcome the proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The co-opted members will provide flexibility and bring experience and expertise which may be lacking to the boards. Co-option will be by elected staff and parents. The Opposition propose that staff and parents elect community members. If their argument is that they want something more democratic, that would imply an electoral college of the community. They rejected that because it would be impractical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
