<p><i>Amendment moved [21 June],</i> No. 8, in page 2, line 35, leave out subsection (2).</p>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. May I clarify a legal point? We were discussing the issue of "without prejudice" letters. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said that he would consult the law books to clarify the position. As he mentioned that there is a dearth of such books in the House, I may be able to save him some time.<br><br>
The words "without prejudice" are commonly used in the context of correspondence between parties who are in dispute and specifically in connection with statements on the position of the writer in relation to that dispute. The letter will usually indicate an offer to settle on a "without prejudice" basis and it may contain factual information relating to the Offer.<br><br>
I said to Opposition members that the inclusion of the words "without prejudice" did not mean that the letter could not be relied on in any subsequent proceedings. That is the case. I am glad to see the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) in the Committee, and I draw his attention to the case of Watson Towers Ltd <i>v</i> McPhail 1986, <i>Scots Law Times,</i> page 617. In that case it was held that the terms of such a letter containing the words "without prejudice" amounted to a statement of fact rather than a hypothetical admission or concession to secure a settlement. The court held that the words "without prejudice" did not protect the letter from subsequent use as an admission of the facts disclosed in the letter.<br><br>
I suggested to the Committee that a "without prejudice" letter could not be regarded as binding on the writer. That again is the case. In circumstances where parties are in dispute and an offer of settlement is made, the "without prejudice" reference means that the letter is prevented from being regarded as binding on the party making the offer. That offer can therefore be withdrawn at any time and could not be relied upon in subsequent proceedings, I think that that is what the hon. Member for Garscadden had in mind when he took a somewhat sceptical view of my position on Tuesday.<br><br>
I hope that that more detailed explanation will be of assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Garscadden)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his courteous attempt to put the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 76</span>
record right. Much thought has gone into his explanation, and we are grateful to him for that.<br><br>
I was discussing amendment No. 8, but raising also some general points about the clause, which you, Mr. Martin, were kind enough to say would be acceptable to the Chair. My preliminary point was simple: I was asking a layman's question about the meaning of a "business". That is defined in clause 9, as the Committee will remember, as including a "trade or profession".<br><br>
Like mirrors that reflect each other in an unending tunnel, we could chase these amendments back forever. It would not be productive for the Committee if I were to invite it to consider what is a trade and what is a profession. There may be a statutory definition—the Minister may be able to tell me whether there is—of a profession. I believe that "trade" is a generic term that has to be interpreted on the basis of common sense. Is membership of the House of Commons a trade? It may have overtones of gentility—it used to have, but I do not know whether it still does—but I suppose that it is a trade. If, as is not unlikely, litigation involved correspondence with a Member of Parliament, would such letters constitute business records for the purpose of clause 5? I assume that they would not be privileged like communications between a solicitor and his client about the subject of the litigation. It is a good point to make about the breadth of the definition and it is something about which the Minister might want to say a word or two. I shall resist the temptation to discuss "undertaking" although that is something that shifts its boundaries of definition as the Government's privatisation programme expands and perhaps, in future under different auspices, contracts.<br><br>
I ask the Minister to explain the significance of the clause. I do that with some trepidation. I found it difficult to understand what the current situation is and therefore what is being swept away. I felt inadequate on that point but was encouraged to read in paragraph 3.66 of the Scottish Law Commission report that the provisions in sections 3 to 15 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1968 are complex and elaborate. Anyone who has taken the trouble to examine the book of relevant legislation, which has helpfully been provided by the Scottish Office, would not disagree with that.<br><br>
I started on a brave expedition to read sections 13 to 16 of that Act. I got hopelessly bogged down as I am sure that the Minister has not had the same unfortunate experience and will be able to lead us through some of the complexities. It may come up later, but perhaps he can tell us in passing what is in section 16 of the 1968 Act. I ask that because it does not appear in the relevant legislation. The number 16 appears, followed by a nice little dotted line. I have not been able to unravel that. We are repealing sections 13 to 16 in the schedule to the Bill. I raise that point because the Scottish Law Commission document refers to sections 13 to 15. The schedule repeals an additional section and I presume that it is connected to and adds something to sections 13 to 15. I should be glad if the Minister clarified that point.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0050">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 77</span>
Paragraph 3.66 of the Scottish Law Commission report is slightly difficult to interpret. Like all the Bill, clause 5 is based on careful arguments by the Scottish Law Commission. Paragraph 3.70 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"However, section 7(3A)"—</p></blockquote>
of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1966, not 1968—
<br><blockquote><p>"only applies to documents falling within section 7, that is to say having the characteristics referred to in paragraph 3.66 above."</p></blockquote>
Perhaps the Minister can help me to follow the argument by explaining what those characteristics are as it is not clear what passage in paragraph 3.66 paragraph 3.70 relates to. I tried to read it this morning, but it is still unclear. I have much sympathy with paragraph 3.66, particularly with the sentence:
<br><blockquote><p>"As regards what we have called the 'original' element of the computer output, we appreciate that computers are complex, and for the uninformed are difficult to understand."</p></blockquote>
I do not know whether the Minister is one of the uninformed, but presumably the characteristics mentioned in paragraph 3.70, to which I have drawn attention, do not include "the
<br><blockquote><p>"The 'original' element of the computer output".</p></blockquote>
It must be considerably broader than that. I have a tidy mind, but I found it a puzzling cross-reference, which I failed to comprehend. This is the right time to have the point nicely tidied up.<br><br>
As I understand it, we are getting rid of not only sections 13 to 15 of the 1968 Act, but section 7 of the 1966 Act. That is made clear in paragraph 3.68, which states that section 7 of the 1966 Act provides that
<br><blockquote><p>"in civil proceedings certain documents are admissible as evidence of the facts stated in them."</p></blockquote>
In other words, this is a matter not of admissibility, but of procedural aspects and how such documents, once admitted, are proved.<br><br>
Paragraph 3.68 goes on to make it clear that that is a conditional point:
<br><blockquote><p>"it is a condition of this exception to the rule against hearsay that the person who supplied the information contained in the document is dead, or beyond the seas or unfit by reason of his bodily or mental condition to attend as a witness or cannot with reasonable diligence be identified or found or cannot be reasonably expected (having regard to the time which has elapsed since he supplied the information and to all the circumstances) to have any recollection of the matters dealt with in the information he supplied."</p></blockquote>
That is a formidable thicket of caveats and reservations. I have a great deal of sympathy with the Scottish Law Commission's simple decision in paragraph 3.66 that
<br><blockquote><p>"the right approach is simply to apply our general provisions on hearsay to the hearsay element in computer print-outs".</p></blockquote>
But not just in computer print-outs—that is presumably the Scottish Law Commission's stance on all forms of records. That is why section 3 of the Banker's Books Evidence Act 1879 will be abolished at the same time.<br><br>
Will the Minister take the Committee through the basic argument and explain what will be removed and replaced, in the straightforward way that I have described?<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 78</span>
As I understand it, the second half of paragraph 3.70 provides that once hearsay evidence, which is documentation, is admissible, there is provision about how to establish it. Paragraph 3.70 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"the procedural requirements for proof of documents … before they can be used for any purpose, have normally to be proved, that is to say identified by a witness speaking to them in court."</p></blockquote>
The suggestion is that that will disappear. I do not need to rehearse the argument at great length, as it is set out in the second half of paragraph 3.70. It refers to section 7(3A) of the 1966 Act, which does
<br><blockquote><p>"make provision for certification of copies"</p></blockquote>
but
<br><blockquote><p>"appears to allow the original document to prove itself by its mere presence in court though it may be difficult to see how, if there is no evidence relating to it, the court can determine whether the document is of a kind falling within section 7 at all. In our view, for a document, which forms part of a business or undertaking, to be admissible as evidence, it is desirable that it should bear some authentication."</p></blockquote>
That takes us to the probing amendment about the acceptability of a facsimile signature and its treatment as a signature. Will the Minister comment on that? As I understand it, it will be simple. Any business record will be admissible and, presumably, can be proved unless challenged. That is the point of
<br><blockquote><p>"Unless the court otherwise directs",</p></blockquote>
which appears in the first line of clause 5. If it is authenticated even by a facsimile signature it becomes a proven fact unless challenged. It may only be a broad discretion to the court on a motion of the other party, but the Minister should explain how the procedure will work.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I recollect correctly, it was agreed that the stand part debate should take place in the context of this amendment.<br><br>
The first question was about the office of Member of Parliament, which is a constitutional office. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) asked whether correspondence constitutes business correspondence. The answer is no, because the Member of Parliament carries out his work in a representative capacity and not for profit. The recovery of a Member of Parliament's correspondence by court order could involve issues of parliamentary privilege. Correspondence in possession of a party to proceedings could be used.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Garscadden referred to section 16 of the 1968 Act, and paragraph 3.66 of the report. That is a textual amendment of an earlier act; it is not usually produced in statutes in force. I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's reasons for tabling amendment No. 8, but one cannot argue in isolation that facsimile signatures should be available for this purpose. We must consider whether that is a sound policy in relation to the Bill's limited purposes for business documents. We must also consider whether the present law has any implications for our answer to that question.<br><br>
The Scottish Law Commission report gives no idea of the basis for the inclusion of facsimile signatures. However, it may have had it in mind that that would reflect appropriately what is current business
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0051">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 79</span>
practice. There is logic in that. The certification confirms that documents are part of business records. However, I appreciate that the records with which we are concerned extend also into the sphere of local and central Government where facsimile signatures are also used to a great extent.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Garscadden said that the certification involved is linked with court proceedings. He might argue that that might call for the certification to be signed with the signature of the officer concerned to imbue that certification with some apparently greater authority than if a facsimile signature were used. I appreciate his point but there are technical difficulties in his approach. A large number of documents may be involved, so it would be inefficient to require each and every document to be individually signed.<br><br>
Such technical difficulties might place significant burdens on small business especially. We must remember that the business or undertaking concerned might not be a party to the proceedings, so that the burden would be even more unwelcome.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Doran <span class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Are not small businesses considerably inconvenienced at present, because managers, or whoever is responsible for documents, are required to attend court? The provision is a considerable concession to such businesses. The whole point of allowing a purely formal form of evidence is to ease the burden but surely asking for documents to be authenticated would be a minimum requirement. It would ensure that they were what they purported to be and that those who would otherwise be required to go to court agree what they were intended to be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman fairly says, that would enable small businesses to be assisted, but there are sufficient safeguards in the Bill and I should like to go through them.<br><br>
The clause provides for certification of documents as part of business records and statements being received in evidence, but that is all
<br><blockquote><p>"Unless the court otherwise directs".</p></blockquote>
Where it considers it appropriate, the court is able to direct that a document should be proved to be part of business records, or that any statement in that document should be authenticated by being spoken to by a witness. That enables an opposing party to have the means to challenge the certification on a document, or to inquire into its origin or authenticity.<br><br>
The amendment of the hon. Member for Garscadden would not achieve the required objective. If clause 5(2) were deleted, the position would be regulated by the Court's interpretations in the case of Cardie <i>v.</i> Wilkinson and Mackay. The case established that where a statue confers evidental value on a document purporting to be signed by someone, it is sufficient that it appears on the face of the document to be so signed and it is unnecessary to prove that it was signed by that person. The case considered the validity of stamped signatures and concluded that where a document has a stamped signature, it is not necessary to show that the stamp
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 80</span>
was actually applied by the person whose signature is reproduced. That was a criminal case involving vehicle excise records. Opposition Members have been anxious to stress to me what they see as the almost paramountcy of the rules of criminal evidence. Therefore they would no doubt readily accept that a rule about facsimile signatures established in criminal proceedings should be capable of being followed in civil cases.<br><br>
Given the decision in the Cardle case, I hope that the hon. Member for Garscadden will see that the amendment would not mean that facsimile signatures would be unacceptable. I hope also that he will be able to accept that the use of facsimile signatures for the purposes of clause 5 is quite sound and that he will, in the light of my somewhat lengthy explanation, withdraw his amendment.<br><br>
Clause 5, taken together with clause 2 allowing hearsay evidence to be admissible, provides a comprehensive statement of the position of documents that form part of the records of a business or undertaking. Clause 2 provides that the hearsay element in any business document is admissible as evidence but it would still be necessary, in the absence of any further provision, to have a witness in court to speak to the authenticity of the document in question. Clause 5 avoids the need for that witness by allowing any statement in the document to be received in evidence without being spoken to by a witness. To qualify for such treatment, the document must be certified as forming part of the business.<br><br>
The clause is essentially a useful extension to all business records of provisions that at present apply only to certain limited categories.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's reply, and shall be happy to let the matter rest.<br><br>
I was interested to hear of the use of facsimile signatures in criminal cases and the decision in the Cardle case. The Minister has the advantage of me, because I know nothing about that case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Shame.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. I welcome my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran). His absence from the Committee has been because of his mighty labours on the law of copyright. He is a practising solicitor, so his opinions in the latter part of the Commitee's proceedings will be particularly welcome.<br><br>
I accept the Minister's point, although his argument on Cardle implied that the amendment was unnecessary because Cardle would achieve the purposes of clause 5(2) in any event. I suppose that one could put that argument the other way round and say that clause 5(2) is not needed, so I though that it was a double-edged weapon for the Minister to deploy. However, I shall not press the matter, and no doubt it is convenient to have the provision in statute.<br><br>
I accept the implication in the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South that procedures will be considerably simplified, particularly for small businesses. There will also,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0052">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 81</span>
presumably, be a considerable impact on many civil proofs. I have never undertaken civil litigation, although I have looked nervously round the edge of court room doors and seen benches and tables groaning under extraordinary piles of paper, which are the entire stock control system or financial records of a firm, and which have been dragged in during some amazingly complex financial complaint. That can happen to large companies as well as small companies, and it is indubitably right to try to simplify that procedure.<br><br>
I was also satisfied by what the Minister said about safeguards. There are safeguards and the court can "otherwise direct", as the clause puts it. There might be some attractions in the implications of what my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South said—he has already been useful in Commitee. He implied that there should be a joint minute procedure, whereby both sides conceded that the records were what they purported to be. In other words, instead of there being a negative acquiescence by the absence of a motion to the court to get a direction on the matter, there should be a positive acquiescence by means of a joint minute. There are attractions in that and, I think, it would not necessarily greatly complicate matters.<br><br>
However, I suppose that a joint minute is another document that has to be drafted, signed and circulated, and another piece of paper that complicates the court process, and on balance, the Minister is probably right in saying that the safeguards are adequate. However, he may wish to add a word or two on that, for, as always, he is helpfully noting points that are made.<br><br>
I shall withdraw the amendment, of course, but I should add that I am delighted to hear that Members of Parliament do not work for profit. I suppose that that is true. We certainly are not in trade in that sense, because, I suppose, we work for love, honour and devotion to public service. I say that without blushing, and I am delighted to see the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), lift his head with interest. I am always expecting to hear that he or one of his hon. Friends south of the border will introduce proper commercial activities into Parliament.<br><br>
I have always thought, for example, that we could have that excellent private sector initiative of performance-related salaries. [Hon. Members: "Hear, Hear."] I thought that that would appeal. We could have a splendid debate. I am told that it has done wonders for the Scottish Development Agency, so why should it not do well for us? But I think that you would becomes a little restive, Mr. Martin, if I pursued that point, indeed, I suspect that you would want to leave the Chair to participate in such an interesting debate. I imagine that you would have trenchant views.<br><br>
I was also intrigued to hear that our records are not business records, because we are a "constitutional office"—that was the Minister's phrase, I think. I do not know that concept. I always thought that we were all brought up with the great truth that there is no British constitution. I know what a statutory office
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 82</span>
is, but I do not know what a constitutional office is. Will the Minister say a brief word about the definition of a constitutional office, so that we are better instructed? I am intrigued, and although I shall not walk 10 ft tall as I leave the Room, I shall be buttressed in my false pride at holding a constitutional office.</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The best that I can do is refer the hon. Gentleman to the writings of Walter Bagehot. To go through them at length would take us many weeks.<br><br>
The reference for lawyers who are following the Cardle case is page 33 of the 1982 Scottish criminal case report. The joint minute procedure to which the hon. Gentleman referred is available now. As for safeguards, I again stress that the operation of subsection (1) is subject to the direction of the Court. In any case where it is appropriate that the court has the power to direct that a document be proved, a witness who can speak to the authenticity of the document will be called. It is important, as it gives an opposing party the means to challenge or inquire into the document's origins or authenticity.<br><br>
I commend the clause to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall withdraw the amendment, but a wonderful area of argument is opening out. If joint minutes are now available why do we need the provision? I accept the implicit criticism that lawyers are not diligent enough in reducing delays in the law. They often have a good reason, such as turnover of work—we are all human—but it is largely because they use old methods and do not take the initiative to use available short cuts. I agree that, in an area where there will be no challenge to the new provisions in clause 5, the same effect could be achieved by a joint minute. But joint minutes are seldom lodged, so all the paraphernalia of proving, production and so on must be gone through, much to the disadvantage of the respective Clients. That is a sad feature.<br><br>
In any event, I am grateful for the Minister's remarks and sorry that he did not say a little more about Walter Bagehot's thoughts on the British constitution. Perhaps we can discuss them another time.</span></p>
<p>I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<br><blockquote><p>"Sections 3 to 5 of the Bankers' Books Evidence Act 1897 (mode of proof of entries in bankers' books, proof that book is a bankers' book and verification of entry in such a book) shall not apply to civil proceedings."</p></blockquote>

I presume that a bankers' book is now a computer. Will the Minister reassure me that that is covered by more modern legislation?<br><br>
It may depress the Committee to know that I come from a long line of bankers, which dates back to the days when bank managers were called bank agents and they had marvellous books written in longhand and in copperplate writing. I presume that the banker's book has come a long way since then.<br><br>
A more important point is that those sections 3 to 5 will not apply to civil proceedings. It is clear that they will continue to apply to criminal proceedings, and that is important in fraud trials. I seem to remember—I confess that I have not checked—that the Scottish Law Commission report, which we have discussed exhaustively, said that the repeal is applied to civil proceedings simply because its remit did not cover criminal proceedings. But the way in which the report was written gave me the impression that the commission would have liked to get rid of it altogether, and to shift it from clause 6 to the schedule of enactments repealed. Does the Minister have any objection to that being done later? Does everyone agree that there is no need for it even in a criminal trial, of is the Scottish Law Commission considering it? Perhaps it is encompassed by the commission's view of the law on criminal evidence. I suppose that in a sense I am writing the Minister's reply by suggesting that but, as the issue has been mentioned four or five times, it does not seem to be giving a hostage to fortune. Will the Minister comment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The forthcoming report of the Scottish Law Commission will cover criminal proceedings. It would be wrong to prejudge the report.<br><br>
The Bankers' Books Evidence Act 1879 which the hon. Gentleman mentioned, is sufficient to accommodate any way in which entries are made in bankers' books and bank records, and the terms of the statute apply. The importance of the clause is that it replaces the current prohibitive rule that original documents are required for evidential purposes. At present, this requirement is relaxed, but only in respect of certain categories of documents—for example, those covered by the 1879 Act.<br><br>
The clause provides that any properly authenticated copy document can be admitted and treated for evidential purposes as if it were the original. The authentication of the copy document must come from the person responsible for making the copy. In all cases, the court retains a power to direct that the original document be produced. This would enable the opposing party to seek to persuade the court that an original rather than a copy document should be produced.<br><br>
As with clause 5, clause 6 is a useful extension to all properly authenticated documents of the existing relaxations applying only to certain categories of documents. The clause will go a considerable way towards alleviating the difficulties inherent in the lodging in court of original documents. I commend the clause to the Committee.</span></p>

Clause 7</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
STATEMENT NOT CONTAINED IN BUSINESS RECORDS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand apart of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should say a word or two about clause 7. It will not delay us for long. It is an interesting clause in the sense that it almost proves a negative. It is always difficult to produce evidence in a civil proof that something does not exist if that has to be done in the positive sense of producing every inch of record, crawling over it and saying to the court, "Mrs Jemima Heep's £315.17 deposit is nowhere recorded in these records." I fully accept that it would be advantageous to have a procedure to produce a statement that the record does not exist. It is important that the evidence, although admissible, can still be challenged. It is not merely a matter of documents being there, it is a matter of proving that they are not there. In this instance, we put a person into the witness box to say "I have looked through all the records of my bank,"—or building society or business—"and I can tell you that this entry is nowhere within." Cross-examination can then take place if necessary.<br><br>
Clause 7(1) states that
<br><blockquote><p>"the evidence of an officer of a business or undertaking that any particular staement is not contained shall be admissible as evidence whether or not the whole or any part of the records have been produced in the proceedings."</p></blockquote>
Presumably in those circumstances, if there were a challenge, it would be up to the other side to recover the records and to lodge them as productions if there was dissatisfaction with the person's evidence and it was to be challenged. Nothing in subsection (1) is the equivalent of
<br><blockquote><p>"unless the court otherwise directs".</p></blockquote>
Presumably if the other side in the dispute was not satisfied with the other person's evidence, the remedy would be to do as I have described. That should be clarified. It is not satisfactory to say to the witness, "I do not believe that and I shall cross-examine you hostilely." To do that, one would need all the evidence—or part of it—to be piled up feet deep in the court. All the records might not be needed, only those parts that might invalidate or cast doubt on the evidence.<br><br>
That is a minor point and I may be making a mountain out of a molehill. However, if business records are germaine, the absence of the provision for the court to direct otherwise must be covered by some procedurarl mechanism. I should like to be clear about that.<br><br>
Paragraph 3.73 of the Scottish Law Commission's report states:
<br><blockquote><p>"In our view, proof should be allowed either in the usual form of witnesses' evidence or, if the court is so minded, by means of the affidavit of an officer of the business or undertaking."</p></blockquote>
Is that still so? It does not appear in clause 7. As business records and hearsay evidence are admissible, if an official of the firm gives an affidavit that the cannot find any trace of the records of a particular payment, for example, presumably that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0054">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 85</span>
must also be admissible. I do not know whether that would be self-proving if not challenged.<br><br>
The Scottish Law Commission's report recommends specifically that that should be done by affidavit. There are no statutory words to cover that and because written records are no longer to be struck out under the hearsay rules, a party to the action might not produce the official, but merely his affidavit. That is worrying. What is the procedural answer? Presumably, the other side could challenge the affidavit as unsatisfactory. But will the Minister talk me through how the other party may ensure, first, that the official is present to speak to the fact that he failed to find the relevant entry in his search and, secondly, that the records can be produced? I presume that there would be no difficulty with that, although it might be cumbersome. The Minister owes us an explanation about what would happen in such circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lords James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raised some interesting points. This has been primarily an English problem in the past, rather than a Scottish one. The clause goes some way toward achieving the impossible by allowing for the proving of a negative. Although they have not yet arisen in Scotland, there have been cases in which a party sought to prove the absence of a particular item in a set of records. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree that it is right that the opportunity should be taken to regulate the position so that such problems do not arise in Scotland.<br><br>
The clause enables the admission of the evidence of an officer in the business or undertaking regarding the absence of a statement from the records. Without such a provision for the absence of a record to be proved, it could be necessary for all the records of an organisation to be produced, at considerable inconvenience to that organisation, and examined by the court simply to establish that there is no relevant entry. That may be looking to the future, but it is right that we should regulate a matter that has given rise to difficulties, at least in one other jurisdiction.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Garscadden asked about a challenge. Of course there could be a challenge, and under clause 7(2), it is likely to be regarded as self-proving. Procedural rules under existing powers as amended by clauses 2, 3 and 4, could so provide, and the court could direct that the official turns up. Clause 7(2) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The evidence referred to in subsection (1) above may, unless the court otherwise directs, be given by means of the affidavit of the officer."</p></blockquote>
The court could otherwise direct if the matter was seriously challenged. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be satisfied with that explanation.</span></p>

EVIDENCE IN ACTIONS CONCERNING FAMILY<br><br> RELATIONSHIPS, ETC.</div> <!-- title -->
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 9, in page 3, line 23, leave out
<br><blockquote><p>"subject to subsection (4) below".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 10, in page 3, line 28, leave out subsections (4) and (5).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a probing amendment. The clause deals with the sensitive area of evidence and actions concerning family relationships—divorce and related matters. That is the subject of a continuing debate in which some of us have been practically and otherwise engaged for many years, and it is important that we get the legislation right.<br><br>
Amendment No. 9 leaves out the words
<br><blockquote><p>"subject to subsection (4) below."</p></blockquote>
and the linked amendment leaves out subsections (4) and (5). Amendment No. 9 is almost a malicous or delaying little amendment because on the whole—and there is no reason for me to depart from my general prejudice in this case—when the Government are going to proceed by some subsordinate rule or legislation, I like them to place in statutes that it should be done in a manner that allows the maximum amount of scrutiny. This measure provides that
<br><blockquote><p>"The Lord Advocate may by order made by statutory instrument provide that subsection (3) above shall not apply, or shall apply subject to such modifications as may be specified in the order, in respect of such class or classes of action as may be so specified."</p></blockquote>
The draft Bill at the back of the Scottish Law Commission report contains under clause 11 a parallel rule which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Rules of court may provide that subsection (2) above shall cease to apply in the case of any particular class or classes of action."</p></blockquote>
I have a passing curiousity about the working rule applied by the Minister to decide between the need for a statutory instrument introduced by the Lord Advocate and the rules of court that were recommended by the Scottish Law Commission. Will the Minister say something about that? I think that I prefer his version, but I have always been curious about how the line was drawn and the criteria and considerations that came into play.<br><br>
Like me, Mr. Martin, you will be familiar with the endless debates in thousands of Committees over the years about positive and negative procedure in statutory instruments. I do not want to get into that, but we have abandoned the rules of court here, probably properly, and it is worth some comment from the Minister. As we are talking about how these instruments of rules of court will be laid, will the Minister say a word or two about what they may contain? I think that it would be convenient for him to do that under this amendment rather than in a clause stand part debate.<br><br>
The Lord Advocate has been given the power to apply or not apply, subject to modifications. I am
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0055">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 87</span>
not clear what these statutory instruments are likely to contain or what they are likely to achieve. What will be taken out of the general rule in clause 8 and what is likely to be included? I do not expect the Minister to anticipate what may happen at some future date in the statutory instruments, but a hint of what he has in mind would be helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have just a few points to make. I come to the debate as something of a traditionalist, having spent the last 10 years of my profesional life involved in a significant number of divorces. I am slightly concerned about subsection (4). As I read it, at some stage in the future the Lord Advocate or the Secretary of State, if one amendment is successful, will be able to produce rules that will put consistorial actions on exactly the same basis as other civil actions. I may be a bit of a traditionalist in these matters, but the Minister will be well aware of the reasons why consistorial actions require some independent source of evidence as they involve status. The old days of the author of the calumny and the requirement for everyone—regardless of the circumstances—to appear in court, thankfully are gone. But we still require that extra evidence. In my experience of drafting affidavits and interviewing some of that evidence is not always independent: it comes from mothers, brothers, sisters and sometimes children and friends of the family.<br><br>
However, it was always impressed on me, and I always impressed it on those whom I trained in the process of taking affidavits, not to treat the provision lightly simply because of the circumstances with which we were dealing. Divorce obviously has consequences, not only for the parties but for the children. I was always concerned that these things should not be approached too lightly. A high volume of divorces go through the courts in Scotland. I do not have the latest figures, but in the last days of the Court of Session's exclusive jurisdiction there were around 10,000 divorces a year. I anticipate that the figures will be higher in the sheriff courts. I am slightly worried, although it is not something on which I would go to the barricades, about the suggestion that that independent element, with the qualifications that I have mentioned, may be going because of the effect that this type of civil action has on the lives of others surrounding the parties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) for his remarks. I am aware that he has had much experience in the courts on this subject. His comments on the need for an independent source of evidence are of interest. I hope that I will be able to reassure him in my comments.<br><br>
The amendments would remove the ability of the Lord Advocate to provide that the requirement in subsection (3) about evidence of someone other than a party to the marriage should not apply in certain cases. Without the power given by subsection (4), that requirement would apply unless changed by primary legislation. I appreciate that the hon. Members who have put their names to this amendment are concerned about why this power is necessary and indeed how it may be used.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 88</span>
The reason for the power being given to the Lord Advocate to act in this way is so that the evidential requirements can be changed quickly to reflect current social attitudes and requirements. I know that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) was in the van of the changes to the divorce legislation when he represented Aberdeen, South so he played his part in seeking to change the law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It took years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. It took years to achieve and there were many complaints about the length of time.<br><br>
It is important for the Committee to be aware of the background to the evidential requirement in subsection (3). It originated in section 36 of the Court of Session Act 1830 which requires the grounds of action to be substantiated by sufficient evidence. The Scottish Law Commission found that the term "sufficient evidence" had been given an additional meaning by the courts to the effect that in certain kinds of action evidence had to come from a source other than a party to the marriage.<br><br>
The commission recommended that this interpretation by the courts should be translated into legislative terms and that is done by subsection (3). Hon. Members will, however, realise that in doing so a degree of flexibility is lost. It is for that reason that the Bill confers a power on the Lord Advocate to deal with the application of this evidential requirement.<br><br>
This is not a novel power. My noble and learned Friend the Lord Advocate has a power at the moment under Section 2(2) of the Divorce Jurisdiction, Court Fees and Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1983 to apply to certain kinds of action a relaxation of evidential requirements as to corroboration. That power has been exercised already in respect of certain undefended actions of divorce. These cases involve two-year and five-year separations.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Garscadden asked about scrutiny. The order is subject to affirmative resolution giving the opportunity for scrutiny and debate. To achieve that sort of change would be inappropriate for court rules which are only procedural. The Lord Advocate has no plans at present for such an order and I cannot say categorically what will be done by an order were it to be brought. It will be the subject of consideration by the Lord Advocate in the light of current circumstances. The orders will basically allow the strict rule in subsection (3) to be disapplied in certain types of cases. There would be appropriate consultation on that matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in what the Minister has said. I do not want to push any of these points, but I still have a couple of concerns which I shall put to one side. Is the Scottish Office actively considering this or are any orders in terms of subsection (3) under consideration? It strikes me that there will be a certain amount of public concern about any relaxation in the requirements, particularly in divorce actions. If such consideration is taking place, it appears that we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0056">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 89</span>
are getting nearer the days of divorce on demand. Certain issues are under consideration in the courts in England and Wales in that respect.<br><br>
That takes us on to the procedure. The majority of cases do not require a court appearance. The procedure for obtaining a divorce is very cumbersome and I think necessarily so. If we reduce the need for corroboration, it will take that need away. Does the Minister believe that we need to examine the procedure to simplify it considerably because we are taking away one of the crutches of that formality? Will we reach the stage where divorces can be dealt with much more speedily, by a much more simplified procedure? That would have consequences for my profession and that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). What is likely to happen to legal aid? We may reach a position in future where solicitors' assistance is unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall soon have a clause stand part debate, but the Minister has raised a few interesting points on the amendment. He said that a statutory instrument is necessary because primary legislation takes far too long. I understand that argument, but it is not helpful to pray in aid the experiences of divorce law reform. In those days that was considered the preserve of private Members' legislation.<br><br>
The Minister remembers correctly—I introduced one of the early ten-minute Bills. It may sound silly to say that such a Bill was significant, but it was one of the milestones that marked the pressure for change which led to the introduction of a Bill—and this is slightly ironic—by the then hon. Member for Argyll, Mr. Iain MacCormick, whose heart, for very honourable reasons, was not in that measure. It was also a tribute to the discipline of the Scottish at that time. However, I am going into the by ways of my parliamentary time.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
I take the point that overall delay is undesirable, but if change is to take place, there is a case for primary legislation, because the Minister seems to be taking a power to disapply the rule that, in a consistorial action, there must be evidence other than from a party to the marriage. That would apply to actions for:
<br><blockquote><p>"divorce, separation or declarator of marriage, nullity of marriage, legitimacy, legitimation, illegitimacy parentage or non-parentage."</p></blockquote>
—in a list which appears in subsection (2). Such a serious matter justifies primary Government legislation. Presumably the Government do not see this as a matter for private Members because they will act by means of Lord Advocate's fiat by means of a statutory instrument.<br><br>
One of the points made in paragraph 2.14 of the Scottish Law Commission's report is about the status of the law and evidence for action for separation. It reverses the fact that:
<br><blockquote><p>"where a party to a marriage speaks to particular grounds of action, that evidence alone will not suffice, and there will have to be evidence from some other source as well to establish the ground of action. This requirement has been introduced to guard against the risk of collusion between the parties to such actions."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 90</span>
I understand all that, but the relevance of the passage is in the line:
<br><blockquote><p>"The rule has not been applied to actions for separation."</p></blockquote>
The report specifically says that the rule should apply to actions for separation or people could get round the rule that evidence has to come from a party outwith the marriage. The report states:
<br><blockquote><p>"We do not think it desirable that parties should be able to circumvent the rules relating to divorce by proceeding via a preliminary action of separation and, accordingly, are of the opinion that the same evidential requirements should apply to both classes of action."</p></blockquote>
That paragraph deals with divorce and actions of separation, but any separation between the various classes, set out in clause 8(2), would raise considerable problems comparable with the specific point in paragraph 2.14. Clause 8(4) allows for the Lord Advocate to exempt actions of separation. That may be unlikely in view of the Law Commission's report, but it is a possibility. The Minister should say in what circumstances he thinks that it would be right. Let us imagine a speculative case. In including a power, one must at least think of a hypothetical situation in which it would need to be used. Presumably, it would not be exempt from the rule of sufficiency of evidence and the inclusion of evidence other than that of a party to the marriage in the case of divorce or separation, but would it be used in the case of nullity of marriage, legitimacy, parentage or non-parentage? I invite the Minister to say a little more.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I was asked by the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) whether the issue was being considered by the Scottish Office. The answer is, "No." Nor is it being considered by the Lord Advocate. It is merely a power that would be written into the Bill and which could be available at a later stage, along the lines of the well-precedented case of the Divorce Jurisdiction, Court Fees and Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1983. The power has been exercised in respect of certain undefended actions of divorce. The hon. Gentleman asked what case I had in mind. I can cite only the case that has already been used where such an order has been in operation.<br><br>
I was asked about simplified procedure and changes in the divorce law. That would go much further than the Bill, which is primarily an evidence Bill. The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South will appreciate that it is a substantial issue, which needs further consideration. We shall have to examine it thoroughly.<br><br>
The rule in subsection (3) can apply only to those cases mentioned in clause 8(3). That would not include—and this will be of interest to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden—(Mr. Dewar)—such cases as legitimacy. The rule in subsection (3) does not apply to such cases anyway and the power could not be used to affect them.<br><br>
The power in subsection (4) is not restricted to disapplication. There can be modifications to the way in which the rule is applied. It is basically a safeguard, which confers on the Lord Advocate the power to deal with applications of the evidential
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0057">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 91</span>
requirement, if there is a strong demand for him to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As so often happens, the Minister, in trying to be helpful, has reinforced the case which I put extremely carelessly. I was happily reading a long list from subsection (2), but the actions under subsection (3), where the evidential rule that we have been discussing applies are limited, as the Minister has said. That means that the exemption from the law of evidence from outwith the parties to the marriage can apply only to divorce actions, separation actions, declarator or nullity of marriage. That seems to strengthen—what I was saying.<br><br>
The Law Commission states that there cannot be two standards of evidence for separation and divorce and that the anomaly should be tidied up, because it might allow people to circumvent the rules on divorce. Therefore, it is even more unlikely that the powers that the Minister is so painstakingly writing into the Bill will be used. If the proposal does not apply to separation but only to declarator or nullity of marriage, that change will fly in the face of the Law Commission's specific recommendation. That is a limited possibility, so I am not impressed. I expect that the Minister has said all that he can or intends to say. I see heads nodding in a resigned way, so I shall have to rest content and reserve any further comments for the clause stand part debate. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This clause is limited and, in many ways, uncontroversial, although I have referred to the sensitivity of the area which it affects.<br><br>
I do not object to the general drift of the clause. The Minister referred to the Court of Session Act 1830. The clause is not simply re-stating that law, but tidying up the edges. One of the rought edges that we have discussed is the escape clause: by starting with a separation people can circumvent the rule that there must be evidence from outwith the marriage. I repeat my slight surprise that that may be reversed by statutory instrument.<br><br>
The other area that the Bill tidies up is referred to by the Scottish Law Commission. In its report, paragraph 2.11 on consistorial actions states of section 36 of the Court of Session Act (1830):
<br><blockquote><p>"While this provision applies in terms only to the Court of Session, a similar rule has been held to apply to those consistorial actions which have been competent in the sheriff court"—</p></blockquote>
a footnote refers us to Walkers, paragraph 159 and Dobie's "Sheriff Court Practice"—
<br><blockquote><p>"and, presumably, will now also be applied to divorce actions in the sheriff court."</p></blockquote>
I suppose that that must be a matter of doubt for the Scottish Law Commission; it came as a surprise to me. At least the clause will, presumably, put the matter beyond argument and beyond peradventure. Will the Minister confirm that?<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) referred, properly, to what the popular
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 92</span>
press calls quickie divorces. They were introduced as a result of the Cowie report—at least, I think that it was Lord Cowie. My memory is getting fair terrible. Under the affidavit procedure, everything is done by affidavit. Such procedure applies only to certain limited grounds which are prayed in aid as a justification for the irretrievable breakdown of the marriage and the decree of divorce. I am not sure how that relates to a Cowie divorce, and whether it affects a Cowie divorce. Perhaps it is simply a matter of producing an additional affidavit from a party outwith the marriage. I presume that the party pursuing must be backed up in that way. No doubt the Minister will say a word or two about this.<br><br>
The general drift of the argument seems valid. At this stage, we should hold to the rule that there should be evidence from outwith the parties to the marriage. I am a bit of a traditionalist in that sense, as is my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South. To some extent, it is a matter of social attitude. The argument is backed perfectly well and with some force in the paragraph dealing with consistorial actions in the Scottish Law Commission's report. It argues that there is no reason why the hearsay rule should not be relaxed because the old distinction between divorce actions and other civil actions has been partly eroded by the abolition of the need for proof beyond reasonable doubt in adultery actions. That was in the law, but is no longer. The Scottish Law Commission suggests that with that gone, there is no real reason to have in the broad thrust of the clause—which is not just about evidence from parties outside the marriage, but the admissibility of hearsay applications in divorce actions—a distinction between consistorial or divorce actions and civil cases generally. It argues that it would be wrong to make such a distinction, so hearsay evidence should be admitted in divorce actions. I am prepared to go along with that.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
Earlier when we talked about the narrower point of evidence from outside the marriage, I said that that should be left as it stands. I know that I cannot tempt the Minister into other areas with which he cannot deal properly. But how permanent is this legislation and the present legal structure for marriage? As my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South said, that is currently being given much consideration.<br><br>
I have read the Scottish Law Commission discussion paper No. 76, which is challengingly headed "The Ground for Divorce: Should the law be changed?", and was published within the past few weeks. Those wishing to submit their views to the Scottish Law Commission must do so by 31 October 1988. We are nearing the end of June, so that leaves only three or four months to assess the considerable implications of the proposed changes and send those views to the Law Commission and, through it, to the Minister. It is fair to ask the Minister to comment on that procedure. If massive changes are to take place, that will make the operation of the clause somewhat academic.<br><br>
Presumably, the Law Commission will assess the reactions that it receives and after further
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0058">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 93</span>
consultation and a full Law Commission report, the Government will consider what legislation to introduce. It will take years to reach that point, because the wide-ranging changes that are proposed must be considered in detail. It would clearly be unfair to ask the Minister about the Government's intentions, but will he comment on the timetable involved? We need to be clear about the framework within which we shall consider the law on divorce and the minor changes in clause 8.<br><br>
The recent discussion paper suggests that the present law on divorce is thoroughly unsound and misleading because it talks about irretrievable breakdown whereas often the grounds that are sought imply a moral fault—behaviour and adultery. The paper says that there is too much emphsis on fault and that that gives an incentive—about which I am doubtful—to commit perjury. In the most recent figures, which are for 1985—I am surprised that they are so out of date—of the 13,356 divorces granted in Scotland, 5,020 were on the grounds of behaviour and as many as 1,760 on the grounds of adultery. That is a high proportion.<br><br>
The paper also argues that the present system distorts the parties' bargaining position. Because a couple must wait two years before an irretrievable breakdown can be established, one party can put unfair pressure on the other about the disposition of property, the matrimonial home and so on, in an effort to get a quick settlement, especially if there is a child by a third party on the way.<br><br>
The paper makes some important charges, although I do not necessarily agree with them all. Its conclusion, which is entirely for discussion, is that the present grounds for divorce should be changed. There should be two options: to make the sole ground for divorce either a period of separation or a lapse of time from the giving of notice of intention to divorce. That period of time will be only about three months, which is extremely short. The writers of the paper prefer the second option, because it would not require proof of separation. So the Law Commission is submitting for discussion the idea that divorce should be granted automatically to a party who has announced his intention to seek divorce three months previously. That has big social implications and dwarfs our petty arguments on the clause.<br><br>
It would be extremely useful if the Minister would say what timetable he has in mind, so that we can examine discussion paper No. 76 more constructively. We shall all want to think long and hard about the matter, as there are dangers of people being trapped and of artificial grounds for divorce being contrived. We remember the arguments about fault grounds being brought in by the backdoor as proof or irretrievable breakdown, and what an unhappy compromise that was. However, the proposals are radical and open up a major debate on the future of divorce law in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) asked whether the sheriff courts must be included. Clause 8(3) applies to all actions, and sheriff court actions are definitely included.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 94</span>
The hon. Gentleman also asked about the permanency of the legislation. I think that he was looking substantially beyond the Bill to the recommendations in the Law Commission report. The Bill's implementation, if any, will depend on when the Law Commission report is produced, the reaction to it, and the weight of representation contained in it. I cannot go further than that now. Although the hon. Gentleman wants me to prejudge the matter, it would be safer for me to act in accordance with the normal democratic procedures.<br><br>
The additional affidavit is not needed in the simplified divorce procedure because of the Lord Advocate's order under the Divorce Jurisdiction, Court Fees and Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1983. In fairness, I should also mention corroboration in affiliation cases, because the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) raised the issue earlier. His query was inspired by his correspondence with a solicitor in his constituency and was to the effect that a pursuer in an action of affiliation would be worse off under the Bill. I hope that I can assure the hon. Gentleman that that is not so. I am sure that he does not seriously consider that we have made a mistake in removing the rule of corroboration by false denial, as there is a considerable weight of opinion in favour of doing that.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman quoted part of paragraph 2.16 of the Law Commission's report, but he is misinterpreting its overall view. He said that there was a suggestion that without the ability to corroborate by a false denial
<br><blockquote><p>"a pursuer with an honest claim in an affiliation case might have had great difficulty in otherwise securing justice."</p></blockquote>
I emphasise the words "might have had" because the apparent usefulness of the doctrine of corroboration by false denial was measured against the background of an evidential regime which required corroboration of the facts in issue before a claim could be successful. Under the Bill, that will no longer be the case. A person seeking to establish an affiliation claim will be able to take the case to court and attempt to satisfy the court as to her claim even on the basis of uncorroborated evidence. I therefore draw the hon. Gentleman's attention back to paragraph 2.16 of the report. I think that he needs to read on beyond the passage that he quoted to me. The Commission goes on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"if our proposal to abolish the legal requirement of corroboration generally in civil cases is accepted, the need for the doctrine"—</p></blockquote>
of corroboration by false denial—
<br><blockquote><p>"will disappear."</p></blockquote>
In his remarks in columns 16 and 17 of the <i>Official Report</i> for Thursday 16 June, the hon. Gentleman suggested that clause 8 of the Bill disapplied the general relaxations on corroboration and hearsay, I can assure him that that is certainly not the case. The relaxations on corroboration and hearsay apply to what the Commission terms "consistorial" actions and this is discussed in paragraphs 2.11 to 2.13 of the report.<br><br>
Clause 8 retains a requirement that in certain kinds of action it will still be necessary, even if the case is undefended for the pursuer, to lead evidence to establish the grounds of the action. That is because
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0059">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 95</span>
such actions involve the status of individuals and can have effect beyond the parties to the litigation. This is discussed in detail in paragraph 2.11 of the report.<br><br>
The position therefore is that inasmuch as an action of affiliation involves the status of a child, it will be included in the reference in clause 8(2) to actions of parentage or non-parentage. That means, as I have said, that the pursuer will require to lead evidence to establish the grounds of action. However, that evidence will be subject to the new relaxed rules on corroboration and hearsay. The hon. Gentleman will see, therefore, that the Bill does not in any way put the pursuer in a worse position than before.<br><br>
I have dealt with this matter at some length.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister. He will understand that such matters are for professionals and that I was trying to raise with him some concerns expressed to me by local solicitors. I am sure that they will now be able to digest and to analyse the Minister's detailed answer and I appreciate his courtesy and care in answering my points.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman. To sum up, the essence of the matter is that because there will be a relaxation of corroboration as well as hearsay in evidential rules, nobody will lose out because the parties to an action will both be able to rely on the relaxations if that is necessary and if no better evidence is available. I commend this clause to the Committee.</span></p>

INTERPRETATION</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 11, in page 3, line 43 after "section", insert "32(2)(d) and".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I may be able to help the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) and expedite this matter by saying that I shall consider it again.<br><br>
On Second Reading, I noted that the hon. Members for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) and for Garscadden raised important points which were not strictly consistent. But I do not wish to make debating points as this is an extremely important subject. The hon. Member for Garscadden has been a reporter, and as this definition relates to children and child abuse—which has been on the increase—I think that I should examine it again to ensure that the Bill deals properly with it and consider returning to it on Report. Our intention would be to come back with another amendment, if considered appropriate, after consultation with interested bodies, including the reporters to the children's panels, such as the hon. Member for Garscadden was before he was returned to the House.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that important points were raised by the hon. Member for Aberdeen,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 96</span>
South (Mr. Doran) and myself on Second Reading. I cannot remember what those points were. I do not say that sarcastically: Second Reading was a long time ago. I am interested to know what the Minister has in mind. It might have been better just to have had a general debate on clause stand part. I merely wanted to raise a number of points about children's panels and the implications of their status as civil proceedings and, in a sense, proceedings totally in their own right. I do not want to push the Minister to say something he is unwilling to say. If he is considering introducing an amendment at a later stage I would like to know what area it is in and what it is about. This is simply a probing amendment to allow a little debate on a subject about which interest was shown on Second Reading.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I came prepared to disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) about the amendment. I was looking forward to that battle, but the Minister has caused me considerable alarm by even considering re-examining this. As he rightly said there is concern about the rising rate, or perhaps simply the detection rate, of child abuse. The professionals—the reporters, social workers and police—greatly welcomed the fact that the Bill would do away with a major difficulty that exists at present in the proof of child abuse. They are worried about the effect of the amendment which would remove the provisions of section 32(2)(d) of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968, leaving a fairly uncertain area.<br><br>
That uncertainty is understandable and jusifiable, and I know that the courts have expressed concern about the standard of proof that should apply to section 32(2)(d) cases. On the one hand it has been assumed that there would be a civil standard of proof—that proof should be on the balance of probabilities. But on the other hand, the finding that grounds are established in terms of section 32(2)(d) sometimes involves the identification of an individual as someone who has committed a criminal act—the sexual or physical abuse of a child. There is obvious concern about the implications of that.<br><br>
If the Minister is to look at this again it should be stressed that the ultimate aim should be the protection of the child. There is no necessity in the establishment of grounds to identiy any individual. There are difficulties, particularly when two procedures run in tandem such as when a prosecution of the alleged perpetrator of the abuse takes place at the same time as the child care proceedings which operate through the Social Work (Scotland) Act. It is important to place on the record the considerable concern that exists about the effects that the amendment would have on future cases.<br><br>
I should also like to put on the record a recent case which highlights the difficulties that are caused. While the Minister who is responsible for social work is present it is worth considering the details of the case in terms of the work of these professionals. The case involves a child of just over four years old. The child was already in care and her father had been in care himself. When the child was being washed in the children's centre, she made a graphic statement. She said, "My daddy touches my flower." That was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0060">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 97</span>
said to a qualified member of staff. It raised considerable alarm among the staff, and the process for investigating such cases was put into train. A case conference was called, in which the police were involved, as were the reporter and social work departments and so on, but because medical examination revealed no physical evidence, it was decided that nothing could be done at that stage.<br><br>
However, the father and mother were brought in for discussions with the reporter and the social worker. The father denied emphatically that he had any involvement with the child or that he had abused the child in any way, but he agreed to seek psychiatric treatment. That may have been a double-edged sword on his part, but it seemed to be some acknowledgement that something was awry. My view is that as the father was fairly institutionalised, he simply accepted recommendations as instructions, as he had done for most of his life.<br><br>
A few weeks later, the father visited a consultant psychiatrist and some progress was made, but he continued to deny his involvement. A few weeks later again, when the child was receiving therapy from an occupational child therapist, she made an even more graphic statement, suggesting that her father had placed his member in her mouth. That, again, was reported, and the authorities felt that despite all the legal problems and difficuties facing them, they could not ignore those two independent statements, which had been made by the child without any prompting or encouragement. Both statements had come out of the blue and had been made to independent professionals, and they required some action by the authorities. One can imagine what would have happened if the authorities had decided that they could not take any action.<br><br>
The authorities knew that it would be difficult to prove the statements in court because they were hearsay evidence, but they felt that there should be a hearing. A hearing was called, the father denied the grounds and the case was taken to the sheriff.<br><br>
The sheriff heard the evidence and made it clear that he was aware that there were impending changes in the law, but that given the evidence that he had heard and the fact that there was no independent medical evidence or independent proof of the child's statements, only the two hearsay statements, he could not find the grounds established. That was accepted, I think, by everyone present, despite the father's continued denials and given the facts presented by the reporter who had dealt with the case and put it before the sheriff. The sheriff then spent 10 minutes lecturing the father and advising him to seek treatment.<br><br>
That case is not untypical. I have dealt with similar cases on my own, and I could spend quite some time with the Committee on individual cases. The case highlights the severe difficulties facing the professionals when they try to prove child abuse. The child was only four and there was no particular reason for her to make those statements as she did. They were unprompted and unsolicited, and show that something serious happened in that household. Had the child not already been in care, the authorities
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 98</span>
would have had no option but to send her back to that household and would have had no power to intervene.<br><br>
The difficulties which the police have in prosecuting in such cases are a separate matter and I understand that. But in the sort of case which I have described, where the police could not prosecute because hearsay evidence would not be accepted in a criminal case, hearsay evidence will be accepted when the Bill is enacted.<br><br>
It is important to state my opposition to the amendment, particularly in view of the Minister's willingness to reconsider the matter, and I urge him to leave the Bill as it stands, at least with regard to that provision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) has said clearly illustrates how difficult and sensitive such cases can be, which is why we believe that it is right to consult the reporters who are directly concerned and also interested bodies on the subject.<br><br>
The rise in cases of child abuse is alarming. That is why I want to ensure that we deal properly with the evidential rules applying to them, and I shall write to the hon. Members on that in due course. All interested parties, including reporters, will be consulted.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) asked what was planned. The obvious approach is that hearings on such cases would be removed from or retained in the definition of civil proceedings in clause 9.<br><br>
It is clear what the amendment means. It would remove from reporters to children's panels the ability to conduct proofs in referrals of what might conveniently be termed child abuse cases. Such cases would have to be dealt with under the present rules of corroboration and hearsay, akin to the requirements in criminal proceedings.<br><br>
I paid attention to what the hon. Member for Garscadden said earlier, in view of his experience, and I also have in mind the views of the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South, which were entirely to the contrary. I think that on a matter of such importance it is necessary to consult, and we shall go into the subject thoroughly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. The matter is now of some importance, and should be treated as such. I have had a long connection with the children's panel system and am a strong supporter of what it attempts to do and the way in which it operates. I believe that it is right that juvenile justice should be decriminalised and that it is a strength that the public are involved. It is important, too, that families are involved in children's hearings, as they are. Above all, as my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) said, it is right that the emphasis should be on finding the right solution for the child and giving the child support and help to operate normally and effectively in the community.<br><br>
It is a difficult area. The amendment is a probing amendment, tabled as a means of allowing a debate
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0061">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 99</span>
on an important area of concern. It is no more than that, and I stress that the Minister must take no more from it than that. We should discuss these matters. I certainly am not trying to bring into the argument some of the more sensational happenings in other parts of the country. We are tidying up and defining civil proceedings in a way that has considerable consequences, in terms of the admissibility of hearsay evidence. That point was put persuasively by my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South. I accept the primary argument, that the child's interests must be paramount in the mind of the people who conduct the children's hearing.<br><br>
It is a difficult situation, because clearly a finding could be seen by the parties involved as a finding of fact—it is a finding of fact in terms of the actings that follow from the children's panel—but, of course, it could be made on the basis of evidence that may not be sufficient to allow a prosecution to follow. Presumably, if the evidence is not there, the fact that there has been a finding by the sheriff which has allowed action to be taken in the case of the child could not be founded upon in a criminal prosecution. The evidence would have to be led afresh and meet the normal standard of criminal proof. It is important to establish that. That is my understanding, but we should be clearer about it.<br><br>
I have had at least one very unfortunate case in which, rightly or wrongly, parents—not a parent in this case—felt that they had been left with a stigma, which I fear, was beginning to dominate their life, despite the efforts of many advisers and those involved in persuading them otherwise.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
The issue is difficult. It includes not only corroboration. At present, there is a different standard of proof and an important distinction between the balance of probability and proof beyond reasonable doubt. If children's panel grounds were dependent upon an alleged criminal offence, under the Bill hearsay evidence could not be admitted. One would also have to establish the grounds before the sheriff in a proof under section 42 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 to a standard of proof that was beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>
If we moved a section on grounds of referral, apart from section 32(2)(g), out of civil proceedings into criminal proceedings and added it, along with Section 32(2)(g), to clause 9, it would mean that hearsay evidence was not admissible. Would it also change the standard of proof, or is that covered by the 1968 Act, and therefore would not alter? That is an important point, which requires clarification now.<br><br>
In this difficult area, the child's interests are prime. I am concerned because the impact on other family members is considerable and should not be swept aside. It is a most serious and damaging allegation if there is no prosecution but the stigma remains that it has been found by another standard of proof.<br><br>
It was proper to begin this debate. Our amendment was a probing device because we recognised an area of genuine concern. A section of statute has struck centrally and specifically at it and we were right to discuss it. I shall withdraw the amendment in the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 100</span>
hope that the Minister understands our reasons for tabling it. After hearing his response, I shall want to take a long hard look at what the Government are saying. I do not regret our discussion but the Minister must not take that in this context as a commitment to any solution. I am aware of some of the professional alarm that was alluded to by my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although the Gentleman may have tabled his amendment as a probing measure, the issues to which it relates are extremely important, as he acknowledged.<br><br>
As to criminal proof and the need to lead evidence, in my view the hon. Gentleman's assessment and interpretation are correct. As to the standard of proof, that would remain as under the 1968 Act; for criminal cases it would be according to criminal standards. The hon. Gentleman spoke of the differences between the standards of proof—these being on the grounds of probability in civil cases and beyond reasonable doubt in criminal cases.<br><br>
I cannot add much more now, but, clearly, we shall regard the matter seriously.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

CITATION, COMMENCEMENT AND EXTENT</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 13, in page 5, line 17, leave out "Lord Advocate" and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"Secretary of State for Scotland".</p></blockquote>
This is a probing amendment that is much less serious than the previous one. Clause 11 provides that when the Bill is enacted it may be cited as the Civil Evidence (Scotland) Act 1988 and that the Act
<br><blockquote><p>"shall come into force on such day as the Lord Advocate may…appoint."</p></blockquote>
I am puzzled, and this is an excellent opportunity for the Minister to explain the remit of the Lord Advocate as distinct from that of the Secretary of State for Scotland. I imagine that the implications are that if we had been fortunate enough to have a Law Officer in the House of Commons, the Minister would not be in charge of the Bill. To most of us, the Lord Advocate is someone who is in charge of the Crown Prosecution Service and he is seen very much in a criminal law context.<br><br>
The Bill is an aggressively civil proposal relating to civil evidence but, apparently, it is within the remit of the Lord Advocate. I am not sure where his remit begins and where that of the Secretary of State begins in terms of civil law. The Lord Advocate is in charge of court administration. Is he also in charge of divorce law reform, and all the other matters that the Bill encompasses? I should have thought that in major matters of civil law and law reform, the Secretary of State should be named. It may be that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0062">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 101</span>
because this will be the Civil Evidence Act as distinct from the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, it falls to the Law Officer rather than the Secretary of State. I understand the Law Officer to be an adviser to the Secretary of State; he is the chief Law Officer and is totally independent of the Secretary of State. It is important to know where the right to determine policy arises, and with whom. Can the Minister advise us?<br><br>
Because of earlier exchanges, the Minister said that he would go away to think long and hard about children's panels and the definition in clause 9. Will it be the Minister, or Lord Cameron of Lochbroom who will be doing the hard thinking and making the decisions? Who has ministerial responsibility—the Lord Advocate or the Secretary of State?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Bill is primarily the Lord Advocate's Bill. To the best of my knowledge, the hon. Gentleman is broadly correct. However, he can check with absolute certainty by reading the parliamentary answer in column 58 of the <i>Official Report</i> of 13th May, which states the precise responsibilities of the Lord Advocate. All the other responsibilities that the hon. Gentleman mentioned will be those of the Secretary of State for Scotland.<br><br>
While I appreciate the reasons for the hon. Gentleman tabling his amendment, I cannot recommend its acceptance. The Prime Minister's statement and the Transfer of Functions (Secretary of State and Lord Advocate) Order 1972 place with the Lord Advocate ministerial responsibility for the law of evidence. The Bill is therefore the responsibility of my noble and learned Friend and it is entirely appropriate that he has the power to make the necessary commencement order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Lord Advocate is not a Member of this House, does he have the right to introduce statutory instruments? I appreciate the embarrassment that the Government face given that there is no Law Officer in the House and that the Secretary of State has to answer for him. But when the Lord Advocate is the Minister directly responsible, Members of the House have no opportunity to question him on the contents of any order, and clearly several, questions need to be answered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is competent for that procedure to be adopted. Under previous Labour Governments there have been no Law Officers inthe House of Commons, and the same procedures will be adopted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am prepared to leave the matter there.<br><br>
I do not have the written answer of 13 May 1988. My final question was a touch frivolous, but the point is important. The Minister said that his is largely the Lord Advocate's Bill. During the past 15 minutes it has become evident that the Government wish to bring about an important change, which will cause considerable angst. Within the generic
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 102</span>
responsibilities of Governments certain Ministers have primary responsibility. Who is responsible for clause 9(a) and the drafting of the exceptions such as in section 32 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968? Is that the Secretary of State's primary responsibility and through him the Minister's or the responsibility of the Lord Advocate?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I mentioned that the Lord Advocate is responsible for evidence and, therefore, for the Bill and will consult Minister responsible for other related matters. Interested bodies will also be consulted.</span></p>

LEGAL AID IN RELATION TO CIVIL PROCEEDINGS</div> <!-- title -->

<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause to read a Second time.<br><br>
The new clause was the admirable work of my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) and it emerged from the discussions at earlier points during the passage of the Bill. At those various points the Minister said that he would not go into great detail because the matters would be discussed when we came to new clause 1. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say now that we have reached new clause 1.<br><br>
The Minister is always courteous and helpful. He drew my attention to a press statement from the Scottish Office dated 15 December 1987. It says that legal aid legislation for Scotland is to be adjusted. That is of interest because there is a great deal of anxiety about the operation of the Scottish Legal Aid Board and the way in which the new system is settling down. My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) is more aware than any member of the Committee of the tensions and difficulties. The new clause states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Lord Advocate shall make a report to Parliament twelve months after this Act comes into force on the application of legal aid to civil cases where proceedings have been affected by the provisions of this Act."</p></blockquote>
That is quite a narrow point. It is based on the assumption—the very sensible deduction—that if the legislation is worth putting on the statute book, it will have some sort of impact.<br><br>
The Bill's main provisions—the relaxation in civil cases of the rules on corroboration and hearsay—will ensure that a number of cases which do not have probabilis causa and would not proceed to proof, may now do so. Therefore, there will be an additional charge on the legal aid fund which is running at
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0063">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 103</span>
around £15 million a year for civil cases, and £40 million a year overall. Those are very rough figures because, like the Minister, I do not have the written answer in my hand.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
The impact of the Bill is likely to be marginal, but it could be significant. To keep tabs on what is happening in this way is an interesting and valuable idea. It emerged from our earlier discussions that the Minister intended to make a number of changes in legal aid legislation, possibly by primary legislation, possibly by regulations. I was hoping to tempt him into telling us what was in the wind.<br><br>
I shall point out the areas of particular interest, because that is always helpful. The press release of 15 December shows that one of the proposed changes is the
<br><blockquote><p>"Reinstatement of the discretion of the court to restrict the award of expenses against a legally-assisted person in all civil cases."</p></blockquote>
I do not know much about this, and I am always keen to learn from the Minister. In this case, let us assume that the pursuer is not assisted and does not have legal aid. He gains the day, and the decree is awarded in his favour against the defender, who is assisted. In such circumstances, the court may restrict the award of expenses against that legally assisted defender, although normally the rule is that the cost go to the successful party. I assume that that is what the proposal means, but no doubt the Minister will correct me if I am wrong.<br><br>
What happens to the unassisted pursuer, who will have only a very restricted award of expenses made in his favour? Will he have to whistle for his money, or can he recover it from some other body? I presume that he will just whistle for his money. The court's view is that because the defender is an assisted person, it will restrict the award of expenses. That raises questions that are ethical as well as practical. I do not wish to pass judgment, but I should like the Minister to explain what is meant by the simple principle of reinstatement of the court's discretion, and how it will work.<br><br>
Another important change in the offing is
<br><blockquote><p>"A change in the arrangements for paying contributions in civil cases, to require assisted persons to pay their solicitor direct."</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South will know a great deal about that. I understand that at present, where there is a grant of legal aid to an assisted person in a civil case, the contribution may—and frequently does—amount to several hundred pounds. That is a substantial sum of money. As I remember the system, such contributions used to be paid to the Law Society of Scotland when it administered the legal aid fund. I understand that the contributions are now paid to the Scottish Legal Aid Board and it is proposed that they should in future be paid to solicitors. There are two points which arise immediately regarding that proposal and I should be grateful for the Minister's explanation. Such a system will be extremely convenient for solicitors because they will get their money up front. At the moment, contributions go to the Scottish Legal Aid Board. Ultimately, they are paid to the solicitor
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 104</span>
with the final account. They are presumably disgorged at a later stage and it will clearly be more convenient for the solicitor to hold on to them and offset them against his final account. That would improve his cash flow.<br><br>
I believe that Scottish solicitors often struggle with the initial costs of an action. The Minister will no doubt tell me whether it is a perceived wisdom from yesteryear, but I understand that a solicitor cannot make an application to the legal aid authorities for the outlays in starting the action until the £150 has been spent. I am told that in England the threshold for application is only £30. That is an anomaly with which the Minister should deal, particularly as court dues may be about £40 or £45 and medical reports may also be involved. I do not know what the equivalent English dues are, but it puts in perspective the efforts of Mr. Hill who brought an action against us all individually on behalf of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson <span class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: He thinks that he is Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not worried about the poor man's delusions, but the financial outlay might have been considerable. I appreciate the advantages, but there is the countervailing disadvantage that it would involve a fair amount of administration and the consequent wear and tear on solicitors.<br><br>
I understand that the two major changes are to be implemented in the Legal Aid Bill, which is currently before Parliament. I culled that fact from a press release. It is an English Bill and I do not suppose that there will be a Scottish Member on the Committee. I do not even know whether the Bill's Commitee stage has been completed. I should like the Minister to say what stage it has reached, because either on Report or in another place, we should like to catch up with the Scottish provisions.<br><br>
I wish to mention the modification of the rules on recovering legal aid expenses on the settlement of divorce actions. I shall not take the issue too far as it is very technical and I do not want to trespass on the Committee's patience. If a successful pursuer, who is an assisted person, retains the family home, and the Scottish Legal Aid Board takes a standing charge on the property to pay for the legal expenses, that means that until the action is settled, the house cannot be sold. Rules are now being made to allow that charge to be attached to a second property, if that person buys a new home.<br><br>
The Minister will not be surprised if I raise the contentious and important point about the effective date from which payment can be made in a legal aided civil action. In the past the solicitor would lodge his application and, if he was reasonably confident about the prospect of legal aid being granted, he might start work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He would.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, he would, as my hon. Friend says, because he would know that when the legal aid certificate came through, he could charge for the work that had been done from the date on which the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0064">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 105</span>
application had been lodged. That was a substantial help and did not cost the legal aid fund a significant amount of money, because the work would have had to have been done anyway. Under the old system, the solicitor would start work as soon as he had lodged his application. Under the new system, the incentive is to wait for the grant, otherwise he would be doing necessary work without being paid. The matter is cost neutral, but if one had a proper interest in one's financial position, one would ensure that the client had to wait until the later starting date.<br><br>
Many representations have been made to the Minister about that and he is well seized of it. The profession, with all its ingenuity, has tried to get round that position. It is caried story, but I am told that in many cases the legal aid application is lodged in the normal way at the same time as an emergency certificate is applied for. That allows the case to get under way while the slow process of assessing, and possibly granting, the main legal aid application takes place. I believe that in 50 per cent. of civil legal aid applications, full grants are accompanied by emergency certificates. How will the Minister deal with that? Does he think that that is satisfactory?<br><br>
I do not know whether it is accurate, but I am told that there are plans, presumably involving statutory instruments, to have a self-administrating emergency certificate and then start work. I suppose that there are precedents, but we should know more about that. In such circumstances the costs will not be met if the ultimate legal aid is not granted. Currently, if one receives an emergency certificate, one is covered for the work done under it and if the full legal aid certificate is not granted, the case comes to a halt, but one is covered up to that point. Anxieties have been expressed about that. The Minister has much to explain.<br><br>
As perhaps befits an Administration that is given to quoting Walter Bagehot, I understand that the Minister is standing firm on constitutional principle. In a press release, the Secretary of State is quoted as saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"there is an important principle at issue here, that public expenditure should be authorised before it is incurred."</p></blockquote>
The Secretary of State cannot overcome that hurdle in his mind, if not in reality. He has set his face against a return to the old system, which would undoubtedly be favoured by the profession and by those who have examined the issue.<br><br>
If that is the case, how can we overcome the practical difficulties? The Secretary of State is quoted also in the press release as saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"Instead of amending the Act, I will assist the Board in speeding up decisions on applications particularly by looking at the means test. In addition I will consider extending the categories of case where action can be taken without the prior approval of this Board."</p></blockquote>
That may refer to the emergency certificates, to which I referred earlier. I am interested in speeding up the means test. Something good may come out of that. In the old days, when I used to fill out those forms, one could tell one's client that it would take three or four months for the Department of Health and Social Security to interview him, assess his financial means and report to the legal aid authorities. There was a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 106</span>
substantial delay before that process was concluded. I understand that that has now been taken out of the remit of the DHSS and that the staff who did that work have been transferred to the Scottish Legal Aid Board, where the assessment is done by specialist staff. That may result in time savings. To use jargon, it has been done "in house". Will the Minister explain how that will work?<br><br>
I also gather that there is a plan to redesign the civil legal aid form, with a view to putting an onus on the solicitor to supply much more information about his client's financial position. At the moment, the assessment of means is a matter between the client and the authorities, but it has been suggested that solicitors should submit docketed and authenticated information to speed up the assessment process.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
The Minister has stood firm against the many pleas to think again about the artificial concept that public expenditure should be authorised before it is incurred. The Secretary of State for the Environment does not seem to be as fond of that theory as the Secretary of State for Scotland. If such a position is to be taken, we should like to know a little more about the state of play and the flexibilities that will speed up consideration of applications of that kind.<br><br>
I apologise to you, Mr. Martin, for having taken a good 10 minutes discussing this matter, but it is important and there is widespread interst in it. I shall listen attentively to the Minister's reply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh <span class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In many ways, new clause 1 deals with the concern that I expressed earlier that the legal aid system may not keep up with and match the changes proposed in the Bill. It would be crazy if a relaxed system of evidence were not matched by a similar attitude by SLAB when considering legal aid applications. Therefore, I seek assurances from the Government that SLAB will keep up with the reforms that they propose.<br><br>
I suppose the new clause and the idea of a reort to Parliament which will provide information on legal aid to civil cases. It is a pity that we do not have such a report on criminal cases and legal aid. Indeed, if the current procedure for legal aid to criminal cases were to apply to civil cases, we would have reason to be concerned. The report that is called for in the new clause would clarify any problems involved in the working of the legal aid system and, hopefully would allow for improvements to be made.<br><br>
Practising solicitors have written to me about some problems. One of them states:
<br><blockquote><p>"I have always regarded it as one of the merits of the scheme that once a Solicitor is satisfied that the client qualifies for Legal aid under the scheme he is authorised to start work immediately. This is particularly important where there is any element of urgency or emergency.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>The view that a Solicitor can start work immediately has been generally held since the commencement of the original Advice and Assistance Scheme several years ago. It is supported by the Application Form which states 'date of signature (and commencement)'. Further, section 10 of the Regulations is in the following terms—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>'The Solicitor shall, within fourteen days of his having begun to give advice and assistance, send to the Board a copy of the clients application'."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0065">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 107</span>
However, a clear exception to the rule that a solicitor can commence work immediately comes under regulation 12, which states that:
<br><blockquote><p>"A client shall not be given advice or assistance in respect of the same matter by more than one Solicitor without the prior authority of the Board, and such authority shall be given only on such terms and conditions as the Board may see fit to impose".</p></blockquote>
That means that, if the client answers the question on the answer form to the effect that he has received advice or assistance from another solicitor, the solicitor must first obtain the board's authority before proceeding with his work. That has posed a problem.<br><br>
One solicitor recently experienced an unexpected difficulty arising out of those regulations. A client completed an application form stating that he had received no previous advice or assistance from another solicitor. With that assurance, the solicitor started to act on his behalf and sent the application form to the Scottish Legal Aid Board for registration in the usual way. He states that he was surprised to receive a circular letter in reply to the effect that his client appeared to have received advice previously on the same subject matter from another solicitor. The board asked for further details so that it could decide whether the application should be registered. Fortunately, in that instance the solicitor was able to satisfy the board that legal aid should continue to be given. However, I wish to draw his anxiety to the attention of the Minister. The solicitor states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The circular letter did however raise a general point of concern. Until then my colleagues and I had always been under the impression that we were adequately covered by Legal Aid from the moment when the Application Form is completed and the question of any contribution resolved except where another Solicitor has been consulted, thus requiring the Board's prior consent. This view seems to be supported by the current regulations. The Board's letter suggests that where a client has told us that there has been <i>no</i> previous consultation and we have proceeded on this information in good faith the application will not be acceptable to the Board if it transpires that this information is incorrect. The question arises therefore as to where we, and any Solicitor, stand concerning payment of our account for the period until the date when we become aware of the true position. If the Board is not to make payment of our account one of the merits of the scheme—namely the ability to act immediately—is destroyed as a Solicitor would have to consider delaying the carrying out of any work for a client until the appliction has been duly registered."</p></blockquote>
The solicitor continues that his main concern is
<br><blockquote><p>"where a client assures us that he has not had advice from another Solicitor but this assurance eventually proves to be false. Clearly in that event the client will lay himself open to both criminal sanctions and civil action for recovery of legal expenses incurred. The practical problem is that in a considerable proportion of these instances the client is unlikely to be in a financial position to make payment"—</p></blockquote>
after all, that is why he has applied for legal aid—
<br><blockquote><p>"and such action may prove to be a waste of time and money.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>In this situation either the Board will require to meet the loss by paying the Solicitors account for the period until the Solicitor becomes aware of the true position or alternatively the Solicitor will require to bear the loss. The Board would appear to be taking the view that the loss is that of the Solicitor.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>I am however worried that this situation may have an adverse effect on a client's positon. If the Board is not to make payment of a Solicitor's account in these circumstances one of the main merits of the scheme—namely the ability to act immediately—is destroyed as in many cases a Solicitor would have to consider delaying the carrying out of any work for a client until the application has been duly registered and he knows that no problem of this sort could arise. Such delay could be prejudicial to the client."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 108</span>
I have corresponded with the Minister on the subject, but his reply has not really tackled the heart of the problem. He has not directly answered the point raised. What he said in his letter is perfectly correct, and I have no argument with him except that the onus is on the solicitor specifically to inquire whether the client previously has had advice or assistance on the matter in question. My query, however, is about a situation in which the solicitor has so inquired and has been assured that the client has not previously had such advice or assistance.<br><br>
Leaving aside the question of a claim against the client—which in practice would be fruitless—who is to meet the costs incurred if that assurance later turns out to be false? One solicitor has given an example of a client who makes an application for legal advice or assistance on 1 May. The solicitor asks him if he has previously had advice on the matter in question and receives the assurance that he has not. The solicitor then submits the application to the Scottish Legal Aid Board in the usual way and, as authorised in the regulations, commences work on his behalf. On 21 May, he is then advised by the Scottish Legal Aid Board that the client has, or may have received, such advice or assistance.<br><br>
Clearly, when the solicitor is advised of the possible problem he would not be authorised to carry out further work until it had been resolved. Between 1 May and 21 May, however, he may have performed work in good faith. Will the legal aid fund meet the solicitor's account and make good his payment? If not, the solicitor who presented that example believes that the client would be prejudcied.<br><br>
There already seems to be a general and widespread problem of delay in granting legal aid, even before the extra work which may stem from this more relaxed form of civil evidence starts to have an effect. Specifically, I am told that the six-month time limit for lodging accounts is too short. Application for an increase in the authorised limits take two to three weeks to be approved. There is also the specific problem of what happens when a solicitor is given wrong information by a client. If the solicitor acts in good faith he should be reimbursed up to the date when he discovers what has happened.<br><br>
Bad administration is another problem faced by the legal aid system. One of my solicitors states that:
<br><blockquote><p>"Many applications are taking months to be decided; some considerably longer than three to four months."</p></blockquote>
In a parliamentary answer to me the Minister said that he has no data on the average length of time taken to deal with legal aid now compared to that taken under the previous system.<br><br>
Another solicitor told me that he was advised by telephone by the civil accounts department that outlays would be reimbursed and that no form was required. However, when he wrote, as advised, he was told that he should apply on the appropriate form. I have further examples that demonstrate the delay in administration. I hope that the Minister will solve the existing problems in the legal aid system before unleashing extra work onto it.<br><br>
The report requested in the amendment represents a useful piece of accountability. It will help to monitor the effects of the Bill and ensure a better-run legal
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0066">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 109</span>
aid system. Legal aid is crucial to our court system. It is an important safeguard for the ordinary citizen. Therefore, anything that strengthens the legal aid system will benefit the whole population.<br><br>
There are anxieties about the present legal aid system. I hope that the report required by new clause 1 will allow alterations and improvements in the working of an important safeguard within our legal system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) introduced me as the Member of Parliament for Aberdeen, South and a solicitor. As soon as he said solicitor, I knew that I had lost the sympathy of my audience. I obviously should delcare an interest as a solicitor. I make my following points in the full knowledge that solicitors are not a breed or profession which usually encourages much sympathy from the public.<br><br>
Special circumstances surround the legal aid scheme. My hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden and the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) made important points. I was a practising solicitor before becoming a Member of Parliaent, so I am aware of the considerable difficulties that arose when the Scottish Legal Aid Board was set up. I had less than a year's experience of the board, but nearly 10
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 110</span>
years experience of the previous system, which struck me as cheap to administer. The rising number of cases meant that far more money was spent on legal aid. However, I used to look at the Law Society's legal aid accounts and found that the system was cheap to operate.<br><br>
I have not had an opportunity to look at the Scottish Legal Aid Board's accounts and I do not know whether they have been published. However, I am sure that they will show increased adinistrative expenditure. One of the Government's stated reasons for introducing the new system was to reduce costs. A body that administers public funds for its own members is always liable to criticism, but the Law Society carried out its task beyond reproach. It made serious efforts to ensure that all facets of the legal aid scheme operated to the satisfaction of all the individuals and groups that it served. It kept down the cost of administration for the Government and lobbied effectively for solicitors to ensure that their remuneration was adequate.</span></p>
